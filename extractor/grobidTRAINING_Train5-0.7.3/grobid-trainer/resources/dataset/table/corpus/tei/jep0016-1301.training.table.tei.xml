            <table>Instrument<lb/> Origins and development<lb/> Conceptual framework<lb/> Validity<lb/> Reliability<lb/> Patient<lb/> Empowerment<lb/> Scale [72,73]<lb/> 38 registered nurses were asked to nominate empowering and disempowering acts<lb/> relevant to interactions between staff and elderly patients. Further acts were<lb/> obtained following a literature review.<lb/> Constructed on the basis<lb/> of a conceptual model<lb/> of empowerment and<lb/> disempowerment derived<lb/> from the literature and<lb/> empirical results.<lb/> Face validity: Patients and<lb/> nurses were consulted.<lb/> Internal<lb/> consistency:<lb/> Cronbach alpha<lb/> from 0.75 to<lb/> 0.87 for the<lb/> empowerment<lb/> subscale and<lb/> 0.65 to 0.88<lb/> for the<lb/> disempowerment<lb/> subscale.<lb/> Content validity: The scale is<lb/> coherent with the conceptual<lb/> model developed, but does<lb/> not take into account all the<lb/> literature on empowerment.<lb/> Construct validity: Factor<lb/> analysis (not detailed in the<lb/> article).<lb/> The resulting lists of 98 acts for each disposition were hypothetically judged by older<lb/> hospitalized people as to the extent they would be either &apos;control giving&apos;<lb/> (empowering acts, n<lb/> = 20) or &apos;control taking&apos; (disempowering acts, n<lb/> = 20) if<lb/> personally experienced. The 20 highest scoring acts in each category were<lb/> incorporated into the Patient Empowerment Scale.<lb/> The instrument was tested on 102 elderly (65 years or older) patients from three<lb/> hospitals (inpatients for at least 3 days) in Central England (acute medicine,<lb/> surgery and elderly care rehabilitation).<lb/> Empowering<lb/> Speech<lb/> Practices Scale<lb/> [74,75]<lb/> The first stage was a conversation of counselling encounters.<lb/> Constructed on the basis of<lb/> a conceptual model of<lb/> empowerment derived<lb/> from a case study by the<lb/> authors.<lb/> Face validity: Patients and<lb/> nurses were consulted.<lb/> Internal<lb/> consistency:<lb/> Cronbach alpha<lb/> for global<lb/> score: 0.88 and<lb/> for subscales:<lb/> 0.52 to 0.83.<lb/> Content validity: This scale<lb/> simultaneously includes<lb/> items related to the<lb/> enablement process and<lb/> outcomes<lb/> Construct validity: Factor<lb/> analysis confirms two factors<lb/> accounting for 59% of the<lb/> variance. Average loading<lb/> for professionally led<lb/> conversation: 0.80 and<lb/> patient&apos;s requests for<lb/> additional clarification: 0.84.<lb/> At the second stage, the study was used to design a questionnaire containing 65<lb/> statements.<lb/> At the third stage, interviews were conducted where five patients and five nurses<lb/> assessed their videotaped counselling sessions by means of the instrument. The<lb/> statements were reduced to 58.<lb/> At the fourth stage, the revised instrument was tested by four patients on a hospital<lb/> ward.<lb/> Finally, 127 counselling situations involving adult patients (56 women and 54 men;<lb/> mean age<lb/> = 54.9 years) were evaluated with nurses (mean age<lb/> = 41.7; average<lb/> experience<lb/> = 13.8) on 17 wards and polyclinics providing care to adult patients in<lb/> Finland. This left a total of 44 statements.</table>
