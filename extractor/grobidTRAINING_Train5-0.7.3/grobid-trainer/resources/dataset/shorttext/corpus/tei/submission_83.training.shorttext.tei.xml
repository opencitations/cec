			<p>Cavity-QED with semiconductor quantum dots enables strong coupling of single dots with single light<lb/> modes of a nanocavity <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>, and holds promise for various quantum information devices as well as for invest-<lb/>igations of the fundamental quantum-optical properties of solid-state quantum emitters. In contrast to atoms,<lb/> semiconductor quantum dots, sometimes referred to as artificial atoms, are in intimate contact with their solid<lb/> state environment, resulting in efficient phonon-assisted scatterings from quantum dot excitons to to cavity<lb/> photons <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>, and posses a non-trivial level structure.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>In this paper we exploit the peculiar level structure of semiconductor quantum dots as well as the tunability of<lb/> the cavity resonance through nitrogen deposition, and investigate cavity frequencies where the biexciton-to-<lb/>groundstate transition is in resonance with two cavity photons (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1c</ref>). At this magic frequency the<lb/> biexciton can decay in a genuine two-photon process, and the corresponding scattering rate becomes drastically<lb/> enhanced through the Purcell enhancement <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. We performed experiments with a single quantum dot embedded<lb/> in a photonic crystal defect cavity. At the magic frequency we observed a significant broadening of the<lb/> biexciton resonance, as a result of the additional two-photon decay channel, as well as a strong reduction of the<lb/> intensity at the biexciton-to-exciton frequency – because the system now predominantly decays by emitting two<lb/> photons at the cavity frequency. The smoking gun for the two-photon decay is provided by additional two-<lb/>photon correlation measurements which show a significantly enhanced photon bunching at the magic frequency.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>Our experimental findings are corroborated by theoretical model simulations based on a master-equation<lb/> approach for the coupled dot-cavity system, including phonon-assisted cavity feeding <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. Although the details<lb/> of biexciton broadening, luminescence quenching, and photon bunching at the magic frequency turn out to<lb/> depend on phonon processes and the excitation scenario, the overall trends are well described by a two-photon<lb/> decay process via the off-resonant exciton state, as depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1c</ref>. With the dot-cavity coupling g and the<lb/> cavity-and dot-decay rates κ and Γ, respectively, one can show that the two-photon resonance effect becomes<lb/> important when g &gt; κ (to ensure that the off-resonant Purcell enhanced biexciton emission is weaker than the<lb/> two-photon emission at the cavity frequency) and g 4 &gt; ∆ 2 κΓ (to ensure that two-photon decay is the dominant<lb/> decay channel for the biexciton, where ∆ is half of the exciton-biexciton splitting). Cavity-assisted two-photon<lb/> transitions could be of importance for dot-based entangled photon sources, using cavities with two orthogonal<lb/> polarization modes, or for non-classical light sources.<lb/></p>
