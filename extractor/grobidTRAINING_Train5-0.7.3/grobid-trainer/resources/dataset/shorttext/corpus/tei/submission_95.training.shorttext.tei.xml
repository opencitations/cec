			<p>The ground-state properties of spatially indirect excitons confined in radially heteronanostructured type-II band<lb/> alignment nanotubes as functions of the magnetic field are theoretically investigated. This system provide with us<lb/> a novel Aharonov-Bohm (AB) device, which is based on spatially separated quasi-one-dimensional electron-hole<lb/> bilayer made of rolled-up type-II band aligned quantum wells, for observation of the so-called excitonic AB-effect.<lb/> Our results explain how the AB oscillations are manifested in both the spectrum and optical intensity of the<lb/> exciton through angular momentum transitions from zero to successive nonzero values and persistent fluctuations,<lb/> respectively. Most importantly is the substantially unusual exciton oscillator strength in such heteronanostructures.<lb/> It is shown that when the exciton is optically active, due to the full cylindrical symmetry of the problem, the<lb/> exciton oscillator strength shows undamped oscillations. This effect is associated with the periodic redistribution<lb/> of the exciton density as the magnetic field is varied. Such study lead to the proposal that electron-hole bilayer<lb/> nanotubes of type-II could provide a platform to investigate new photonic quantum interference, magneto-optical<lb/> switching, polarization-sensitive photodetector, and photovoltaic devices based on the AB-effect which may have<lb/> potential applications in quantum information systems. As depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig.1</ref>, the exciton ground-state energies,<lb/> i.e. E 0,l (B)&apos;s, as functions of the magnetic field are plotted for various orbital states l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. At zero<lb/> magnetic field, orbital states with the same modulus are degenerate. There is clearly no splitting for the case l = 0,<lb/> while all exciton lines with nonzero orbital quantum numbers are split into two sublines in a non-equidistance<lb/> manner. A few crossing points joining two different orbital states are shown by arrows. We examine the influence<lb/> of magnetic field on the optical intensity of the exciton by evaluating the excitonic oscillator strength. As shown<lb/> in <ref type="figure">Fig.2</ref>, it exhibits undamped fluctuations caused by the AB effect. This means that, due to the full cylindrical<lb/> symmetry of the problem, the exciton oscillator strength in such a heteronanostructure is substantially different<lb/> which is associated with the periodic redistribution of the exciton density<ref type="biblio">[1, 2, 3, 4]</ref>.<lb/></p>
