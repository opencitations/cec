			<p>Studies on localized spins in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been attracting considerable interest.<lb/> This is because the discrete electronic levels involved in the optical transitions serve the fascinating applications<lb/> in which QDs are used as emitters of single, indistinguishable, and entangled photons. For these applications, it is<lb/> crucial to study the polarization of the emitted photons associated with exciton annihilation. The actual QDs have<lb/> the anisotropic distributions of shape and strain, and as a result, the confinement potential symmetry is reduced<lb/> from D 2d to C 2v or lower. It is well known that the shape anisotropy induces the change from circular polarization to<lb/> linear polarization of the photoluminescence (PL) as an exciton fine structure. Also, QDs formed by self-assembly<lb/> in the Stransky-Krastanov growth mode have more or less the residual strain with the anisotropic distribution<lb/> originating from the QD formation process <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. Consequently, the PL polarization is affected by the anisotropic<lb/> exchange interaction (AEI) and the strain-induced valence-band mixing (SI-VBM). The former originates from<lb/> the QD shape asymmetry and the latter comes mainly from the in-plane anisotropic strain relaxation. Generally,<lb/> III-V semiconductor QDs have a smaller strain anisotropy than that in II-VI QDs <ref type="biblio">[1, 2]</ref>. Therefore, the precise<lb/> estimation of the composite of AEI and VBM in III-V semiconductor QDs have not been reported so far.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to probe the interactions that reduce the QD symmetry, the µ-PL measurements of the self-assembled<lb/> In 0.75 Al 0.25 As/Al 0.3 Ga 0.7 As QDs were performed at 6 K under no magnetic field. The unpolarized excitation at<lb/> the wetting layer (∼728 nm) was employed in order to ignore the dynamical process depending on the initial<lb/> polarization and to reflect directly the ground state basis to the PL. The high quality unpolarized light was made<lb/> as a temporal averaging non-polarization by an EOM with the modulation period that was much shorter than the<lb/> accumulation time (∼1 sec.) of a Si-CCD detector. The degree of linear polarization (DLP) of the PL was analyzed<lb/> by using a set of a rotating half-wave plate and a fixed polarizer in front of a triple-grating spectrometer.<lb/></p>

			<p><ref type="figure">Figure 1(a)</ref> shows a polar plot of the PL intensities of a neutral exciton (X 0 )<lb/> doublet and a positive trion (X + ) in the same single QD. The ground state of<lb/> X + has two holes in a spin singlet and one electron, and has a half-integer<lb/> total spin. Therefore, X + does not split irrespective of the QD symmetry<lb/> under no magnetic field and the effect by the SI-VBM can be observed di-<lb/>rectly. The X + PL and the calculation using the 8×8 Bir-Pikus Hamiltonian<lb/> indicate the DLP∼25%, θ s ∼100±3 ◦ , and ρ s A/∆ lh ∼0.22, where the angle<lb/> θ s is a coupling phase in the hh-lh mixing that decides the strain orientation<lb/> and ρ s A/∆ lh is the coupling strength by the strain. When the effect of SI-<lb/>VBM is combined with AEI, the X 0 PL properties are found to change in the<lb/> following points: (1) PL intensities of the doublet become uneven, (2) The<lb/> angle χ between the linear polarization axes of the doublet deviates from 90 ◦<lb/> (χ=81±3 ◦ in <ref type="figure">Fig.1(a)</ref>), and (3) The observed splitting energy of the doublet<lb/> varies from the splitting energy without strain δ b depending on θ s and θ b (the<lb/> splitting energy of 70 µeV that was observed directly from the spectra was<lb/> different from the δ b (43 µeV), which gave the best fitting). These features<lb/> can be found clearly in the figure and the appearance becomes clearer with<lb/> increasing ρ s A/∆ lh . We have analyzed tens of QDs in the same manner. δ b<lb/> and δ s are shown in (b). Both angles have the dense distributions around 90 ◦<lb/> and 170 ◦ with the similar dispersion of ∼40 ◦ , although there is no definite<lb/> correlation between them of individual QDs. The correlations of other in-<lb/>trinsic parameters of individual QDs will be reported in the presentation. In<lb/> summary, the composite effect of AEI and SI-VBM in the neutral exciton<lb/> PL was fully investigated and the method gives a clear perspective on the<lb/> polarization states in the self-assembled QDs.</p>
