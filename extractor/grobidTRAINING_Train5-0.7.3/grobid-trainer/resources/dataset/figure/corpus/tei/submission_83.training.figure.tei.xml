				<figDesc>(a) Simulated and (b) measured spectra for a coupled dot-cavity system in the strong-coupling<lb/> regime for different cavity wavelengths. The arrows indicates the magic frequency where the biexciton-to-<lb/>exciton transition is in resonance with two cavity photons and luminescence becomes quenched. Panel (c)<lb/> reports the level scheme under consideration.</figDesc>
