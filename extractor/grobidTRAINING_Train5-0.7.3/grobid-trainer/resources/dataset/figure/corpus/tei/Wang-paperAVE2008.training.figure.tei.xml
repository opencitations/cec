				<figDesc>Our AVE system uses the RTE system (Tera â€“ Textual Entailment Recognition for Application) as a core component.<lb/> The preprocessing module mainly adapts questions, their corresponding answers, and supporting documents into Text (T)-<lb/>Hypothesis (H) pairs, assisted by some manually designed patterns. The post-processing module (i.e. the Answer Validation<lb/> in the picture) will validate each answer and select a most proper one based on the output of the RTE system. The new<lb/> modules added are the NE Recognition and Question Analysis. Thus, we will have extra information like NEs in the answers,<lb/> Expected Answer Types (EATs), etc.<lb/></figDesc>
