Field of the Invention </p><p>[0002] The present invention relates to a combined chassis and mixer apparatus for mixing livestock feed. More specifically, the present invention relates to a combined chassis and mixer apparatus for mixing livestock feed in which location and positioning of the mixer container for dispensing the livestock feed is enhanced. </p><p>[0003] 2. Information Disclosure Statement </p><p>[0004] Mixers are primarily used for mixing various foods for subsequent distribution to animal feed troughs. However, prior art mixers include a drawbar and hitch for connection to a tractor The tractor includes a power take off (PTO) and a driveline must be connected between the tractor and the mixer in order to rotate a mixing auger within the mixer container. When the feed has been mixed, the tractor tows the mixer to the animal trough where a portion of the feed is discharged through an outlet in the mixer container for feeding the cattle. </p><p>[0005] Although <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 5,782,559</ref> to Neier et al teaches a self-propelled material mixer, the prior art arrangements suffer from the following drawbacks: In the Neier et al arrangement described in the '559 patent, the operator is located at the back which is a disadvantage. </p><p>[0006] The combined tractor and mixer according to the present invention has the following advantages over the more conventional mixers towed by a tractor. First, the combined tractor and mixer of the present invention is shorter. Second, the combined tractor and mixer is easier to maneuver. Third, the combined tractor and mixer according to the present invention is easier to backup. Fourth, the combined tractor and mixer has better traction when compared with the mixers towed by a tractor. Also, with the towed mixers, the mixer must be hitched and unhitched to the tractor when mixing is to be carried out. </p><p>[0007] The combined chassis and mixer of the present invention overcomes all of the aforementioned problems associated with the prior art arrangements by the provision of a combined apparatus which enables an operator thereof to accurately locate the outlet of the mixer in close proximity to the animal feed trough. </p><p>[0008] Therefore, it is a primary feature of the present invention to provide a combined chassis and mixer which overcomes the problems associated with the prior art proposals and which makes a considerable contribution to the art of mixing and distributing animal feed. </p><p>[0009] Another feature of the present invention is the provision of a combined chassis and mixer apparatus in which the mixer is permanently connected in driven relationship with the chassis. </p><p>[0010] Other features and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art by a consideration of the detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the present invention contained herein. </p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading><p>[0011] The present invention relates to a combined chassis and mixer apparatus for mixing livestock feed.
