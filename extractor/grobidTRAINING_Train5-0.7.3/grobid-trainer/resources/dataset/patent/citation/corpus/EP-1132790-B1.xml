such as a robot, a machine tool and a manufacturing machine, having an electric
motor as a driving source of the machine, and in particular to a controller
capable of preventing a vibration of a controlled system such as the machine, an
attachment of the machine and the machine with the attachment.</p><p num="0002">In the controller for a robot, there have been developed various
acceleration/deceleration control methods for obtaining an optimum
acceleration/deceleration motion of the robot so that mechanism of the robot do.
not vibrate. According to these methods, an acceleration/deceleration control
suitable for the robot mechanism and capabilities of electric motors for driving
the robot mechanism is performed to enable a high speed robot motion in
operating the robot without an end effector attached to the robot.</p><p num="0003">In the controller for a machine tool, a band rejection filter is used for
suppressing sympathetic vibration between the electric motor and the
mechanism driven by the electric motor.</p><p num="0004">With the above method, there arises no problem in a case where an end
effector attached to the robot is relatively small or a workpiece held by a hand
as the end effector is relatively small. However, in recent years, as shown in
FIG. 6, a robot system with a large hand 2 attached to the robot 1 for handling a
relatively light but bulky workpiece (e.g., a press machined product such as a 
vehicle body or door) has been increased. Such large hand and the workpiece to
be handled with such large hand have low rigidity compared with the robot
mechanism. Thus, the hand and the workpiece held by the hand may vibrate
when the robot is operated with high speed although the robot mechanism is
controlled not to vibrate. With this vibration, there arises problems that the
hand fails to hold a workpiece at the predetermined position or the hand drops
the workpiece in handling the workpiece. Thus, there is a case where the robot
can not operate at the taught speed with a hand attached or the hand holding a
workpiece although the robot itself can operate at the taught speed.</p><p num="0005">At present, the operation speed of the robot is adjusted on a trial-and-error
basis so that the hand and the workpiece held by the hand do not vibrate in
a trial operation of the robot, which is time consuming. Further, a
workpiece and a peripherical device may be damaged if the hand drops the
workpiece or collides with the peripherical device due to the vibration of the
hand and the workpiece in the trial operation of the robot. Such trial operation
loads an operator with a heavy and time consuming burden. </p><p num="0006"><ref type="patent">EP-A-0 685 779</ref> discloses a method of computing a drive pattern for
suppressing vibration of an industrial robot according to the precharacterising
part of attached claim 1, wherein vibration occurring at an
arm part of an industrial robot is controlled by combining vibrations
occurring at two time points for mutual interference.</p><p num="0007"><ref type="patent">US-A-4,195,265</ref> discloses a notch filter employed for eliminating any
component of the control signals for the motion of a mechanical apparatus,
substantially equal in frequency to the natural resonating frequencies of the
mechanical apparatus.</p><p num="0008">The present invention provides a controller for a machine having an
electric motor as a driving source of the machine, said controller
comprising: natural frequency determining means for determining a
frequency or a cycle of a natural vibration of the machine and/or an
attachment attached to the machine as a controlled system; and motion
command generating means for generating a motion command for the
electric motor such that the natural vibration of the machine and/or the
attachment is suppressed in accordance with the frequency or the cycle of
the natural vibration determined by said natural frequency determining
means; characterised in that: said natural frequency determining means
comprises a frequency analyser for analysing a vibration frequency of a
control signal for the electric motor to determine the frequency or the cycle
of the natural vibration, and said motion command generating means has a
filter for reducing an amplitude of the natural vibration, and automatically
alters a coefficient of said filter in accordance with the frequency of the
cycle of the natural vibration determined by said frequency analyser.</p><p num="0009">Preferably, the controller further comprises storing means for storing
the frequency or the cycle of the natural vibration determined by said
frequency analyser, and said motion command generating means generates a
motion command for the electric motor based on the frequency of the cycle
of the natural vibration stored in said storing means. </p><p num="0010">The frequency analyzer analyzes the control signal
regarding a torque, a velocity or a position of the electric motor.</p><p num="0011">In the case where the controller controls a robot with an end effector
attached thereto as the attachment, the motion command generating means has
an acceleration/deceleration processing section for creating an
acceleration/deceleration motion command for operating the robot in accordance
with the frequency or the cycle of the natural vibration of the end effector such
that the natural vibration of the end effector is suppressed.</p><p num="0012">A parameter of the acceleration/deceleration processing section is
altered based on the frequency or cycle of the natural vibration of the end
effector.</p><p num="0013">The acceleration/deceleration processing section may comprise first and
second filters connected in series for performing linear acceleration/deceleration
processing, and a filter length of the second filter is determined based on the
frequency or the cycle of the natural vibration.</p><p num="0014">The acceleration/deceleration processing section may comprise an
exponential function filter having a low-pass filter, and a cut-off frequency of the
exponential function filter is determined based on the frequency or cycle of the 
natural vibration.</p><p num="0015">The acceleration/deceleration processing section may comprise a band
rejection filter for rejecting a predetermined band including the frequency of the
natural vibration.</p><p num="0016">The end effector may be a hand, a gun or a torch. In the case where
different kinds of end effectors are used, the natural frequency determining
means stores data of frequencies or cycles of the natural vibrations of the
different kinds of end effectors, and date of frequencies or cycles of the natural
vibrations is selected in said data in accordance with a kind of the end effector
attached to the robot.</p><p num="0017">In the case where a hand is used as the end effector, the natural
frequency determining means determines the frequencies or cycles of the natural
vibrations of the hand holding a workpiece and holding no workpiece, and the
acceleration/deceleration processing section creates the
acceleration/deceleration motion command such that the natural vibration of the
hand with or without the workpiece is suppressed in accordance with holding
status of the hand and the frequencies or the cycles of the natural vibrations
determined by said natural frequency determining means.</p><p num="0018">In the case where the hand handles a different kind of workpiece, the
natural frequency determining means stores data of each frequency or cycle of
the natural vibration of the hand holding the different kind of workpiece and
data of frequency or cycle of the natural vibration of the hand is selected in said
data in accordance with a kind of workpiece held by the hand. Further, the
natural frequency determining means may store data of frequencies or cycles of
the natural vibrations of the hand without holding any workpiece and holding a
different kind of workpiece, and data of frequency or cycle of the natural 
vibration of the hand is selected in said data in accordance with holding status of
the hand and a kind of workpiece held by the hand.</p><p num="0019">A degree of suppression of the natural vibration can be variably set.
The frequency or cycle of the natural vibration may be determined by a
measuring device or based on a torque or a velocity of the electric motor in the
robot when an external force is applied to the end effector.</p><p num="0020">For a better understanding of the invention, and to show
how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be

a robot according to the present invention. A main processor 101, a memory 
102 composed of a RAM, a ROM and a nonvolatile memory (such as an
EEPROM), an interface 103 for a teaching operation panel 104, an interface 106
for external devices, and a servo control section 105 are connected to a bus 107.
To the interface 103 for a teaching operation panel is connected a teaching
operation panel 104.</p><p num="0022">A system program for supporting basic functions of the robot and robot
controller is stored in the ROM of the memory 102. Robot operation programs
and their related set data which are taught in accordance with applications are
stored in the nonvolatile memory of the memory 102. Particularly according to
the present embodiment, a natural frequency Frq(n) associated with a schedule
number fn for each status of an end effector (hand) is stored in the nonvolatile
memory. The RAM of the memory 102 is used as a memory for temporary
storage of data for various arithmetic operations performed by the processor
101.</p><p num="0023">The servo control section 105 comprises servo controllers 105a1 to
105an (n: sum of the number of all the axes of the robot including movable axes
of an end effector attached to a wrist of the robot) each composed of a
processor, a ROM, a RAM and the like. Each servo controller performs
position/velocity loop control and current loop control of its associated
servomotor for driving an axis. It is a so-called digital servo controller which
performs loop controls of position, velocity and current by software. Each
servomotor M1-Mn for driving each associated axis is drivingly controlled in
accordance with the output of its associated servo controller 105a1-105an
through its associated servo amplifier 105b1-105bn. Although not shown in
FIG. 1, a position/velocity detector is attached to each servomotor M1-Mn, and
the position and velocity of each servomotor detected by its associated 
position/velocity detector is fed back to its associated servo controller 105a1-105an.
Sensors provided in the robot and actuators and sensors provided in the
peripheral devices are connected to the input/output interface 106.</p><p num="0024">The above basic structure of the robot controller is in no way different
from that of a conventional robot controller. According to one embodiment of the
present invention, the controller controls an acceleration/deceleration motion of
the robot such that the end effector does not vibrate in an operation of the robot
in accordance with a kind of the end effector attached to the robot and also an
operation status of the end effector e.g. workpice holding or not holding status
of the hand, and further in accordance with a kind of workpiece held by the
hand, in comformity with an operation to be performed by a robot.</p><p num="0025">As shown in FIG. 6, in the case of handling a bulky workpiece such as
a body or a door of a vehicle (not shown) with the large hand 2, which is
attached to a wrist at an distal end of an arm of the robot 1 as an end effector,
for holding the workpiece by vacuum sucking, a vibration of the large hand 2
may be generated when the robot 1 is operated. If the vibration of the hand 2 is
generated, the workpiece can not be hold by the vacuum sucking of the hand so
that the robot operation has to be suspended until the vibration ceases, to lower
the operation efficiency.</p><p num="0026">Further, in the operation of the robot 1 with the hand 2 holding the
workpiece, if the vibration of the hand 2 or the workpiece is generated, the hand
2 may drop the workpiece. According to the present invention, the robot
operation is controlled taking account of frequencies or cycles of natural
vibrations of the hand itself and the hand holding a workpiece. In the case
where the hand handles workpieces of different kinds, a frequency or a cycle of
a natural vibration of the hand holding a different kind of workpiece is taken into 
consideration.</p><p num="0027">In order to achieve such control, the natural frequencies of the end
effector itself and the end effector with a workpiece are measured and stored in
the memory 102 of the robot controller in advance.</p><p num="0028">FIG. 7 shows an example of measurement of a natural frequency Frq of
the hand 2 of the robot 1 as shown in FIG. 6.</p><p num="0029">First, the robot 1 is operated to have a predetermined position/posture
suitable for measurement by means of a measuring device such as a laser
displacement meter, and the hand 2 is hit by a hammer 4 to generate vibration.
In this illustrated example a laser displacement meter 3 is employed as the
measuring device. If the frequency of the vibration is changed according to
position of hitting, the measurement is performed at a plurality of hitting
positions and the minimum value of the measured values is determined as the
natural frequency Frq.</p><p num="0030">Alternately, the natural frequency Frq or the cycle of the natural
vibration may be determined based on a torque or a velocity of the motor for
driving a wrist axis of the robot 1 without using the measuring device.</p><p num="0031">When the end effector attached to the robot wrist vibrates, a torque or a
velocity of the motor for driving the wrist axis varies periodically with the
vibration of the end effector. By measuring a frequency or a cycle of the
periodical variation of the torque and the velocity of the motor, the frequency of
the cycle of the natural vibration can be determined without any external
measuring device.</p><p num="0032">The following description will be made on an example of determining
the cycle of the natural vibration and thus the natural frequency using a
disturbance estimating observer provided for the motor. </p><p num="0033">First, the end effector attached to the robot is hit by the hammer to
vibrate the end effector. FIG. 8 shows an example of a variation pattern of the
disturbance torque of the motor for driving the wrist axis. As shown in FIG. 8, a
cycle T<sub>hand</sub> of the natural vibration can be determined by measuring a time period
between adjacent peaks (local maximums) or adjacent bottoms (local
minimums) of the disturbance torque. The motor of which the disturbance
torque is estimated is selected in the motors for driving the wrist axes and the
posture of the robot is determined and fixed in advance so that a direction of the
vibration of the end effector is consistent with a rotational direction of the axis
driven by the selected motor. Alternatively, disturbance torques of all of the
motors for driving the wrist axes are estimated and the motor for an axis having
the most large variation of the disturbance torque may be selected. Thus, the
disturbance torque of the selected motor is estimated by the disturbance torque
estimating observer provided for the selected motor, and the cycle T<sub>hand</sub> of the
natural vibration is calculated based on the estimated disturbance torque.</p><p num="0034">Specifically, after the robot is held to have at the predetermined posture,
the end effector is hit by a hammer and a natural frequency calculation software
stored in the memory 102 of the robot controller is started by a signal from the
teaching operation panel 104 or an external signal so that the main processor
101executes a natural frequency calculation program.</p><p num="0035">The main processor 101 starts execution of the natural frequency
calculation processing as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10 upon receiving a command
for executing the natural frequency calculation software.</p><p num="0036">First, variables Rec and N are initialized (Step D1) and the disturbance
torque Trq estimated by the disturbance torque estimating observer for the wrist
axis motor is read (Step D2). Then, it is determined whether the variable Rec is 
&quot;0&quot; or not (Step D3), and the procedure proceeds to Step D6 if the variable Rec
is not &quot;0&quot;. If the variable Rec is &quot;0&quot; (initially Rec is set to &quot;0&quot; in Step D1), the
read disturbance torque Trq is compared with a predetermined disturbance
threshold Tlim (Step D4) and if the read disturbance torque Trq does not exceed
the threshold Tlim, the procedure proceeds to Step D8 where the variable N is
incremented by &quot;1&quot;. After waiting for elapse of a predetermined time period
Tint (Step D9), the procedure returns to Step D2 to repeat Step D2 and the
subsequent Steps. The disturbance threshold value Tlim defines a trigger of
starting storage processing of history of the torque variation, and is set to a
sufficiently low value relative to the disturbance torque due to the vibration of
the end effector. The waiting time Tint defines a cycle of reading the
disturbance torque and is set to an appropriately low value relative to the cycle
of the natural vibration of the end effector.</p><p num="0037">If it is determined that the read disturbance torque Trq exceeds the
threshold value Tlim in Step D4, the variable Rec is set to &quot;1&quot; (Step D5), and
the read disturbance torque Trq is stored in a register R[N] (Step D6). Then, it
is determined whether or not the variable N exceeds a maximum storage number
Nmax (Step D7). If the variable N is determined not to exceed the maximum
storage number Nmax, the variable N is incremented by &quot;1&quot; and after waiting
elapse of the waiting time Tint, the procedure proceeds to Step D2 to perform
the processing of Step D2 and the subsequent Steps. Since the variable Rec is
set to &quot;1&quot; in Step D5, the procedure proceeds from Step D3 to Step D6 where
the disturbance torque Trq read in the present sampling period is stored in the
register R[N]. Then, it is determined whether or not the variable N exceeds the
maximum storage number Nmax in Step D7. If the variable N does not exceed
the maximum storage number Nmax, the variable N in incremented by &quot;1&quot; and 
after waiting elapse of the waiting time Tint, the procedure returns to Step D2.
Subsequently, the processing of Steps D6, D7, D8 and D9 is repeatedly
executed until the variable N exceeds the maximum storage number Nmax, to
store the history of torque variation in the register R[N].</p><p num="0038">If it is determined that the variable N exceeds the maximum storage
number Nmax, the torque history storage processing is terminated and the
procedure proceeds to Step D10, shown in FIG. 10. The variables M, J and K
are set to &quot;0&quot; in Step D10 and a difference d1 between the disturbance torque
stored at (M+1)th sampling period and the disturbance torque stored at M-th
sampling period, and a difference d2 between the disturbance torque stored at
(M+2)th sampling period and the disturbance torque stored at (M+1)th sampling
period are calculated (Step D11).

increasing to decreasing (the curve of the estimated disturbance torque shown in

Thus, the resister To stores the larger value of the resister T1 and the resister
T2.</p><p num="0044">The value of the resister T0 is multiplied by the sampling period (waiting

adjacent local minimums (Step D23). This time period means the cycle Thand
of the natural vibration of the end effector. The natural frequency Frq is
calculated from thus obtained cycle Thand of the natural vibration and stored
(Step D24). Thus, the natural frequency of the end effector which is attached to
the robot wrist is determined based on the torque exerted on the motor for
driving the axis of the robot wrist, and the natural frequency calculation
processing is terminated.</p><p num="0045">In the foregoing example, the natural frequency Frq of the end effector is
determined based on the disturbance torque estimated by the disturbance torque
estimating observer. The natural frequency Frq may be determined based on an
electric current of the motor instead of the estimated disturbance torque.

Further, the natural frequency Frq may be determined based on a velocity of the
motor which is detected by a velocity detector provided on the motor.</p><p num="0046">As descrived, the natural frequency Frq is determind using an external
measuring device or based on an estimated disturbance torque, an electric
current or a velocity of the motor for driving the wrist axis. The natural
frequencies of the hand 2 holding a workpiece and not holding a workpiece are
determined. In the case where a different kind of workpiece is to be handled by
the hand 2, each natural frequency of the hand holding a different kind of
workpiece is determined. If the measured natural frequencies have different
values, the respective natural frequencies are stored in the robot controller to be
associated with an operation status of the hand and the kind of workpiece. </p><p num="0047">The robot controller of the present invention controls the robot so that
the end effector does not vibrate in operation of the robot using the determind
and stored natural frequency (or the cycle of the natural vibration) of the end
effector. Thus, when the robot is to be operated, the natural frequency suitable
for the operation status of the end effector designated in the operation program
or by an input signal is selected, and parameters for acceleration/deceleration
processing are modified based on the selected natural frequency to generate an
acceleration/deceleration command for performing the acceleration/deceleration
motion.</p><p num="0048">A first embodiment in which acceleration/deceleration control means for
generating acceleration/deceleration commands comprises two filters connected
in series for performing linear acceleration/deceleration will be described. A
value of a motion command X1 after the linear acceleration/deceleration
processing is expressed as the following equation (1), where p represents a filter
length (number of resisters), x represents a present motion command, x1, x2, ...,
xp-1 represent motion commands of past (p-1) processing periods, which are
distributed from a host computer at every predetermined period.
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">X1 = (x + x1 + x2 +, ..., xp-1)/p</st32:df></p><p num="0049">The motion command X1 as an output of a first filter is inputted to a
second acceleration/deceleration processing means to perform two-step linear
acceleration/deceleration processing of the acceleration/deceleration control
means of this first embodiment</p><p num="0050">FIG. 11 shows relationship between an input and an output of the linear
acceleration/deceleration processing means. When the same velocity x (i.e., the
motion command at each distribution period) is inputted for a predetermined
time (predetermind number of distribution periods), an output X2 of the second 
acceleration/deceleration processing filter is generated as shown in FIG. 11.</p><p num="0051">In FIG. 11, the acceleration varies and thus the jerk, i.e. second
derivative of the velocity, is not &quot;0&quot; in sections Q1, the acceleration remains
constant and the jerk is &quot;0&quot; in sections Q2, and the velocity remains constant
and the acceleration and the jerk are &quot;0&quot; in a section Q3.</p><p num="0052">In the first linear acceleration/deceleration processing, since the motion
command x of the same value is inputted at every distribution period, the output
of the first linear acceleration/deceleration filter increases by &quot;x/p&quot; according to
the equation (1) at the beginning of the processing, i.e., the acceleration is
constant. After elapsing p time-periods, the sum of x, x1, x2, ..., and xp-1
having the same value is divided by p in the equation (1) and thus the output X1
becomes equal to the input x, i.e., the velocity is made constant. The velocity
indicated by the output X1 of the first acceleration/deceleration filter increases
linearly and then remains constant after elapsing the time period corresponding
to the filter length p which represents a time constant.</p><p num="0053">The second acceleration/deceleration filter, to which the output X1 of
the first acceleration/deceleration filter is inputted and having a filter length q,
performs acceleration/deceleration processing in the similar manner as the first
acceleration/deceleration filter to produce an output X2 shown in FIG. 11. An
example of variation of the output X2 is shown in the following table 1, where
the filter length p of the first acceleration/deceleration filter is set to &quot;8&quot; and the
filter length q of the second acceleration/deceleration filter is set to &quot;4&quot;. <img file="00180001.tif" id="img-EP-1134802-A3-00180001" he="135" wi="159" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" orientation="unknown" inline="no" /></p><p num="0054">As shown in Table 1, the output of the first acceleration/deceleration
filter increases at each processing period from the first period to the eighth
period, and becomes equal to the input x after the eighth period. The output X2
of the second acceleration/deceleration filter increases until the eleventh
processing period. Thus, the output X2 indicates the velocity command since
the output X2 designates a motion amount at the predetermined fixed period and
thus the variation of the output X2 indicates the acceleration. The acceleration
is present until the eleventh processing period and thus the velocity increases,
and then the acceleration becomes &quot;0&quot; to output the motion command x. The
jerk, which is variation of the acceleration, increases by x/8√ó 4 = x/32 at each
processing period from the first processing period to the fourth processing 
period. The jerk becomes &quot;0&quot; from the fifth processing period to the eighth
processing period since the acceleration remains constant value of 4x/32 = x/8,
and decreases by x/3 from the ninth processing period to the twelveth
processing period.</p><p num="0055">Thus, the velocity command (motion command at every processing
period) as shown in FIG. 11 is obtained by connecting two linear
acceleration/deceleration filters in series. As stated above, in the
acceleration/deceleration processing means comprising two linear
acceleration/deceleration filters, the acceleration is determined by the filter
length of the first liner acceleration/deceleration processing and the jerk is
determined by the filter length of the second linear acceleration/deceleration
processing.</p><p num="0056">The jerk Jmax is expressed in the following equation, where Frq

of the operation program (Step S2). If the line number L does not exceeds the
last line number, a motion statement at the line number L of the operation
program is read (Step S3). Then, a schedule number fn is read and the natural

calculated based on the motion statement read in Step S3 and information of the
robot mechanism (link lengths of the robot arm, etc.) (Step S8). The
acceleration Accn is compared with the minimum acceleration Acc stored in a
register which is set to the maximum allowable value in the initial setting. If the 
calculated acceleration Accn is smaller than the minimum acceleration Acc, the
calculated acceleration Accn is stored in the register as the minimum
acceleration (Step S10). Then, the register is incremented by &quot;1&quot; (Step S11). If
the acceleration Accn is not smaller than the minimum acceleration Acc, the

minimum value fulfilling the condition (8) (Step S15). The filter length q of the
second filter obtained in Step S15 is compared with the filter length q' of the

for a robot for suppressing a vibration of an end effector attached to a robot.
The present invention can be generally applied to an industrial machine such as
a robot, a machine tool and a manufacturing machine having an electric motor as
a driving source of the machine, so as to suppress vibration of the machine
itself, an attachment attached to the machine and the machine with the
attachment, as a controlled system.</p><p num="0116">Hereinafter described is another embodiment of the present invention
having a function of suppressing the vibration of the industrial machine such as a 
machine tool and a manufacturing machine. A filter for suppressing the
vibration of the machine is provided to receive a torque command from the
velocity loop, as shown in FIG. 14.</p><p num="0117">As stated, the natural frequency of the machine varies with variation of a
load, dispersion in manufacturing of the machine, variation of environment in
use and aging of the machine, to lower the vibration suppressing function of the
filter. According to the present invention, coefficients of the filter is altered in
accordance with the variation of the natural frequency to improve the vibration
suppressing function.</p><p num="0118">FIG. 14 is a block diagram of a control system (including a psotion
control section, a velocity control section and a current control section) of an
electric motor for driving a movable mechanism of an industrial machine of a
robot, a machine tool such as a machining center, a lathe, an electric discharge
machine, a laser machine, and a manufacturing machine such as an injection
molding machine, a press machine, a conveying machine and a winding
machine, as a controlled system. The position control section 202 performs a
velocity loop control based on a position command from a host computer such
as a numerical controller (NC) and a position feedback signal from a
position/velocity detector 201 such as a pulse coder for detecting a position and
a velocity of a servomotor 200, to output a velocity command. The velocity
control section 203 performs a velocity control based on a velocity command
form the position control section 202 and a velocity feedback signal form the
position/velocity detector 201, to output a torque command. The torque
command is subjected to filtering processing by a filter 204 and then inputted to
the current control section 206. The filter 204 employed in this embodiment is a
band rejection filter as shown in FIG. 13. Coefficient (time constants Ta, Tb) of 
the filter 204 are automatically altered in conformity with the natural frequency
obtained by analysis by a frequency analyzer 205, to cope with the variation of
the natural frequency.</p><p num="0119">The current control section 206 performs a current control based on the
torque command and a current feedback signal from a current detector (not
shown) for driving a servomotor 200 through a servo amplifier 207.</p><p num="0120">The position, velocity and current control sections perform the position-loop,
velocity-loop and current-loop processing, respectively in the conventional
manner except that the coefficients of the filter are altered in accordance with
the natural frequency analyzed by the frequency analyzer 205. The processing
of the filter 204 is performed by a processor which performs the above position-loop,
velocity-loop and current-loop processing.</p><p num="0121">According to this embodiment, the frequency analyzer 205 is provided to
receive a control signal regarding position, velocity or current of the servomotor
200, and the coefficients of the filter 204 are automatically altered in accordance
with variations of the natural frequency of the machine to suppress the vibration.</p><p num="0122">FIG. 15 shows the filter coefficient alternation processing to be
performed by the processor in the servo control system.</p><p num="0123">First, a central frequency of the band rejection filter 204 used in the
control system is converted to a frequency per a sampling processing period
during which sampling processing of a control signal is performed, and set to a
register as a frequency K[0] per the sampling processing period, on a stage of
manufacturing the machine. The central frequency of the band rejection filter
204 is initially set to coincide with a natural frequency of the machine at the
manufacturing of the machine and thus the frequency K[0] indicates a frequency
per the sampling processing period, which represents a natural frequency of the 
machine in the manufacturing.</p><p num="0124">In an operation of the machine, the processor of the control system
executes the processing as shown in FIG. 15 at every predetermined period to
automatically alter the coefficients of the filter 204 in accordance with variations
of the natural frequency of the machine.</p><p num="0125">First, frequencies K[1]-K[4) are obtained by adding &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot; and
&quot;4&quot;, respectively, to the frequency K[0] and stored in registers, and frequencies
K[5]-K[8] are obtained by subtracting &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot; and &quot;4&quot;, respectively, from
the frequency K[0] (Step E1).</p><p num="0126">Then, a control signal is sampled Nmax times in the sampling processing
period (Step E2). The sampling processing period &quot;TS&quot; is expressed by TS = ts
√ó Nmax where &quot;ts&quot; represents a sampling period. The control signal of a torque
command outputted from the velocity control section 203 is sampled in this
example. However, the control signal to be sampled may be one of the velocity
command from the positin control section or the position feedback signal, the
torque command (current command) from the velocity control section or the
velocity feedback signal, and a current feedback signal so as to determine the
natural frequency.</p><p num="0127">Vibration amplitutes G[0]-G[8] of the sampled control signal at the
frequency K[0]-K[8] are obtained through the frequency analysis well known in
the art (Step E3). Then, vibration amplitutes G[0]-G[8] are multiplied by
predetermined evaluation coefficients C[0]-C[8], respectively, to obtain
evaluation vibration amplitutes G'[0]-G'[8] (Step E4). The evaluation
coefficients C[0]-C[8] are fixed values not less than &quot;0&quot;.</p><p num="0128">G'[n] = C[n] √ó G[n], where &quot;n&quot; is an integer from 0 to 8</p><p num="0129">Then, the evaluation vibration amplitute G'[0] is compared with the 
other evaluation vibration amplitutes G'[1]-G'[8] to determine whether or not
the magnitude G'[0] is the greatest in the magnitudes G'[0]-G'[8] (Step E5). If
the magnitude G'[0] is the greatest, the coefficients of the band rejection filter
204 is not altered and the procedure returns to Step E1 to repeat the processing
of Steps E1-E5.</p><p num="0130">If the magnitude G'[0] is not the greatest, the procedure proceeds to Step
E6 to determine &quot;n&quot; by which the evaluation vibration amplitude G'[n] is the
greatest and the determined &quot;n&quot; is set as &quot;n0&quot;. Then, it is determined which
central frequency altering method is to be adopted (Step E7). If a first central
frequency altering method is to be adopted, the vibration frequency K[n0] is
determined to be a natural frequency of the machine in terms of frequency per
sampling processing period and the vibration frequency K[0] representing the
natural frequency of the machine is renewed to be the frequency K[n0]. Then,
the renewed vibration frequency K[0] is converted into the frequency Frq and
the converted frequency is set to the central frequency of the band rejection
filter 204 (Step E8). The coefficients (time constants) Ta and Tb are obtained
according to the following equations as described, and renewed (Step E10).
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">Ta = 1/(Frq+H)</st32:df><st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">Tb = 1/(Frq-H)</st32:df></p><p num="0131">In the above equations the set value H defines a half of the band to be
cut off, and thus the machine is driven by the torque command with a band 2H
expanding around the central frequency Frq cut off.</p><p num="0132">If a second central frequency altering method is to be adopted, the
procedure proceeds to Step E9. In Step E9, if the K[n0] is greater than the
frequency K[0], the frequency K[0] is renewed to be the frequency K[1], i.e.,
the frequency K[0] is incremented by &quot;1&quot;, and the renewed frequency K[0] is 
converted into the frequency Frq to be uses as the central frequency of the band
rejection filter. If the K[n0] is smaller than the frequency K[0], the frequency
K[0] is renewed to be the frequency K[5], i.e., the frequency K[0] is decreased
by &quot;1&quot;, and the renewed frequency K[0] is converted into the frequency Frq as
the central frequency of the band rejection filter. Then, the coefficients Ta and
Tb are obtained and renewed based on the frequency Frq (Step E10).

Subsequently, the procedure returns to Step E1 to execute the processing of
Step E1 and the subsequent Steps.</p><p num="0133">The above described is the processing of automatically altering the
coefficients of the filter provided in the control system for suppressing the
natural vibration of the machine.</p><p num="0134">FIGS. 16 and 17 show variation of the control signal (torque command
Tcmd) with the above-described natural frequency altering function ON and
OFF, respectively, in a case where the natural frequency of the machine is
changed to 250 Hz and the central frequency of the band rejection filter is set to
220 Hz. FIG. 17 shows variation of the control signal with the natural
frequency automatic altering function ON according to the second central
frequency altering method. As can be seen from comparison of FIGS. 16 and
17, the vibration amplitude of the control signal (torque command TCMD) is
reduced when the natural frequency automatic altering function is ON.</p><p num="0135">In this embodiment, the band rejection filter 204 is adopted as the filter
for suppressing the vibration. Alternatively, only a low-pass filter may be
adopted since the natural frequency of the machine is relatively high. In this
case, the coefficient of the low-pass filter is altered in accordance with variation
of the natural frequency of the machine in the similar manner.</p><p num="0136">Further, in this embodiment, the filter 204 is arranged before the current 
control section 206 to receive the torque command (current command) from the
velocity control section 203 as shown in FIG. 14. Alternatively, the filter 204
may be arranged before the velocity control section 203 to receive a velocity
command from the position control section 202 to reduce the amplitude of the
natural vibration.</p><p num="0137">In general, since an attachment to the machine such as an end effector
has a natural frequency lower than that of the machine itself, it is effective to
arrange the filter to receive the position command for reducing the natural
vibration of the end effector and it is effective to arrange the filter to receive the
torque command (current command) for reducing the natural vibration of the
machine itself.</p><p num="0138">According to the present invention, vibration of an end effector of a
robot is suppressed to perform a robot operation effectively and safely.</p><p num="0139">Further, a motion command is generated so as to suppress the natural
vibration of the movable part of the machine even if the natural vibration varies
in accordance with variation of load, dispersion in manufacturing of the
machine, environment in use and aging of the machine.</p></description><claims lang="DE" status="new"><claim num="xx"><claim-text>Steuereinrichtung f√ºr eine Maschine (1), die einen
