Field of the Invention </p><p num="P-0002"> The present invention relates to aesthetically pleasing insect repellant systems and more specifically a landscape apparatus comprising a rock and a citronella oil-burning device. </p><p num="P-0003"> 2. Description of the Related Art </p><p num="P-0004"> Many people like to relax in a pleasing outdoor environment such as a back yard and a landscaped garden. Such enjoyment is particularly sought in the summer when insects abound and can cause a nuisance to, for example, a group of people enjoying a cookout. Thus, there is a need for an apparatus that discourages insect pests. </p><p num="P-0005"> People generally enjoy outdoor experiences such as spending time in a landscaped garden. It is important that flying insects do not mar the outdoor experience. Anti-insect devices can be used to keep an outdoor location free of annoying insects. However, many anti-insect devices are not attractive to look at and can detract from the ambience of the outdoor experience. Thus, there is a need for an anti-insect device that does not interfere with the natural enjoyment of an attractive outdoor scene. </p><p num="P-0006"> Some insects, such as mosquitoes, appear at dusk when natural sunlight is limited. Some insect repellant systems are difficult to see in low light conditions. Still other insect repellant systems are overly complex and expensive to manufacture. Thus, there is a need for an attractive insect repellant system that is easy to see in low light conditions and is not overly complex in structure. </p><p num="P-0007"> Lamps fueled by combustible liquid fuel are known. For example, <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 5,938,430</ref>, issued Aug. 17, 1999 to A. H. Majerowski, describes a liquid fuel lamp having a wick and a fuel container for containing a combustible liquid fuel that can contain insect repellent such as citronella. Such lamps don't fit well into a landscaped environment where the owner wants the lamp to remain camouflaged or otherwise hidden from view in order to avoid detracting from the landscaped scenery. The '430 devices includes a support pole capable of being thrust into the ground or otherwise engaged to hold a lamp holder in an elevated and generally highly visible position even when the '430 device is not in use. </p><p num="P-0008"> <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 5,765,751</ref>, issued Jun. 16, 1998 to A. V. Joshi, describes a device for the controlled release of volatile substances. The '751 device comprise a battery driven volatile substance delivery system employing permeable membrane technology. The −751 device is not easy to see in the dark and is overly complex. </p><p num="P-0009"> <ref type="patent">U.S. Pub. No. US 2001/0008318 A1</ref>, published Jul. 19, 2001 to J. Mosbaugh, describes a method of making an artificial rock fragrance delivery system. The Mosbaugh system is not designed to be visible in low light conditions. </p><p num="P-0010"> None of the above inventions and patents, taken either singly or in combination, is seen to describe the instant invention as claimed. Thus a landscape product that burns citronella solving the aforementioned problems is desired. </p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading><p num="P-0011"> The invention is directed to a landscape product that burns a fuel containing citronella to deter insects in a landscaped environment. The landscape product comprises a container defining an aperture, a stone having a through bore and located above the fuel container, a wick holder located above the aperture and extending through the through-bore to a position above at least part of the stone, and a wick extending upwardly from within the fuel container and through the wick holder to a location above the wick holder and thence to a position above at least part of the stone. The landscape product is capable of burning a liquid fuel containing citronella oil to provide a landscape product to deter undesirable insects. </p><p num="P-0012"> Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention to provide an attractive looking apparatus that discourages insect pests by burning citronella oil. </p><p num="P-0013"> It is a further object of the invention to provide an anti-insect device that complements a landscaped environment. </p><p num="P-0014"> Still another object of the invention is to provide an attractive insect repellant system that is visible in low light conditions. </p><p num="P-0015"> It is an object of the invention to provide improved elements and arrangements thereof for the purposes described which is inexpensive, dependable and fully effective in accomplishing its intended purposes. </p><p num="P-0016"> These and other objects of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading><p num="P-0017"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an environmental, perspective view of a first embodiment of a landscape product that burns citronella oil according to the present invention. </p><p num="P-0018"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an environmental, perspective view of a second embodiment of a landscape product that burns citronella oil according to the present invention. </p><p num="P-0019"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a perspective view of the landscape product of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. </p><p num="P-0020"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is an exploded view of the landscape product of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. </p><p num="P-0021"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic section view of a landscape product that burns citronella oil according to the present invention. </p><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p num="P-0022"> Similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the attached drawings. </p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading><p num="P-0023"> The present invention is directed to an aesthetically pleasing insect repellant system and more specifically a landscape apparatus comprising a stone and a citronella oil-burning component.

The stone <b>160</b> serves to hide the fuel container <b>120</b> from view. The stone <b>160</b> is preferably chosen to fit any one of a range of landscaped environments found, for example, in landscaped gardens. Thus, the stone <b>160</b> may take any one of a number of forms to suit a range of landscaped environments including natural landscaped environments, e.g., natural desert gardens around houses built in the desert in Phoenix and Scottsdale, Ariz., USA. </p><p num="P-0026"> The position of the stone <b>160</b> relative to the fuel container <b>120</b> is designed to ensure that the landscape product <b>100</b> fits perfectly into the landscaped environment <b>110</b>. </p><p num="P-0027"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the second embodiment of the landscape product <b>100</b><i>b </i>in combination with a plant pot <b>260</b>. The fuel container <b>120</b> is at least partly buried in a body of filling <b>280</b>; the filling <b>280</b> can comprise of any suitable material such as sand and/or earth. An optional at least one plant <b>300</b> is located in the filling <b>280</b> as shown; the optional at least one plant <b>300</b> can comprise any suitable plant such as, but not limited to, one or more of the following: a suitably sized cactus, a shrub, a Mediterranean perennial bulbous herb such as a jonquil, and/or a bulbous herb whose flowers has a large corona elongated into a trumpet such as a daffodil. </p><p num="P-0028"> Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the at least one plant <b>300</b> is a cactus and the filling <b>280</b> is sand thereby rendering the landscape product <b>100</b><i>b </i>particularly suitable for placement in, for example, a desert garden setting as found in housing developments in desert regions around Phoenix, Ariz., USA. It should be understood that the filling <b>280</b>, the at least one plant <b>300</b>, and the stone <b>160</b> may vary without detracting from the spirit of the present invention. </p><p num="P-0029"> Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the landscape product <b>100</b><i>b </i>further comprises an optional protective cap <b>320</b>. The protective cap <b>320</b> comprises a stone cap <b>340</b> attached to a flame and water resistant tube <b>360</b> such as a copper tube or brass tube; the tube <b>360</b> may also be made of a heat resistant polymer. The protective cap <b>320</b> protects the wick <b>220</b> from rain or inadvertent damage when the landscape product <b>100</b><i>b </i>is stored or otherwise not in use. The protective cap <b>320</b> also functions as a flame snuffer to enable a human owner or operator to safely snuff out the flame <b>240</b>. The stone cap <b>360</b> ensures that the landscape product <b>100</b><i>b </i>remains a visibly attractive item when not in use. </p><p num="P-0030"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a perspective view of the landscape product <b>100</b> according to the invention; the landscape product <b>100</b> is shown in combination with the optional protective cap <b>320</b> comprising the water resistant tube <b>340</b> and the stone cap <b>360</b>. The spatial relationship between the stone <b>160</b> and fuel container <b>120</b> is evident in the figure, wherein the stone <b>160</b> is sited above the fuel container <b>120</b>. In use the fuel container <b>120</b> is at least partly buried in the ground <b>110</b> or filling <b>280</b> with the stone <b>160</b> hiding the top of the fuel container <b>120</b>. The fuel container <b>120</b> may also be hidden from view by, for example, a layer of mulch <b>400</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). </p><p num="P-0031"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows an exploded view of the landscape product <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.
