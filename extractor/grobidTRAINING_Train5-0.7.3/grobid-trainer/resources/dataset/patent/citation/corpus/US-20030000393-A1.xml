The invention is characterised in that the brewing chambers (<b>1</b><i>a</i><b>, 1</b><i>b</i>) are juxtaposed and topped with a mobile tray (<b>4</b>) provided with an orifice designed to be positioned opposite the brewing chambers (<b>1</b><i>a</i><b>, 1</b><i>b</i>), for opening and closing the chambers (<b>1</b><i>a</i><b>, 1</b><i>b</i>) depending on its position. The invention also concerns a machine for making espresso coffee incorporating said unit. </p></abstract><description load-source="us" status="new" lang="EN"><p>[0001] The present invention concerns a unit for making beverages by brewing of a dose of product to be brewed. </p><p>[0002] It also concerns an automatic machine for making beverages like espresso coffee, incorporating the unit described in the invention. </p><p>[0003] According to the invention, the unit comprises several brewing chambers, each provided with a receptacle for the dose and means for injecting hot water into each of the brewing chambers. </p><p>[0004] The invention will be particularly applicable to the field of making coffee-based beverages of the espresso type. </p><p>[0005] It may be used to build and operate an automatic machine that is very practical to use and highly productive. </p><p>[0006] Automatic unit for making espresso coffee are already known. </p><p>[0007] In that respect, the document <ref type="patent">EP-A-0.450.200</ref> discloses an automatic unit for espresso coffee comprises a pressure chamber for the preparation of the coffee, this pressure chamber comprising a closing/opening element for the insertion and removal of the coffee powder and at least one adjustable movable wall defining the volume of the chamber. </p><p>[0008] In the document, the single brewing chamber is closed at the top by a pivoting element and at the bottom by a mobile piston. </p><p>[0009] The pivoting element can adopt an opened position to the admission or the evacuation of the ground. </p><p>[0010] However, the unit has the drawback of only making it possible to make a single coffee or a double coffee by increasing the quantity of grounds in the brewing chamber. </p><p>[0011] It does not allow associating several brewing chambers, which means that the efficiency of the machine is conventional, i.e. it only completes one brewing operation at a time. </p><p>[0012] Besides, the cost of this unit design is high, particularly because of the form of the mobile piston and the closing system at the top of the chamber. </p><p>[0013] It is also known the document <ref type="patent">EP-A-0.604.350</ref>, which describes a coffee machine that includes two receptacles with a dose of coffee each, two pistons that press down the said dose of coffee and two ejectors. The machine is used to prepare one or two coffees at the same time and three coffees if one of the receptacles has a double capacity and a double outlet. Each seat or base mounted to turn along with the main shaft has a cavity in which a support for a filter is positioned, through which the brew passes. The angular distance between the receptacles is the same as that of the pressure pistons so that they are opposite the said receptacles at the same time. The ejectors intended for the brewed coffee dose are fitted with the same angular distance. </p><p>[0014] Two brewing chambers can be formed according to this document by doubling all the essential means—piston, receptacle and ejector. </p><p>[0015] Even though it provides for building two brewing chambers, the machine has the drawback of increasing the number of constituent parts required for that use. </p><p>[0016] For instance, all parts come in a pair which is heavy, complicated and costly. </p><p>[0017] Further, the machine only enables the coupled operating of the brewing chambers—if you wish to use them both, they must follow simultaneous identical cycles. </p><p>[0018] As a result, the machine does not make for flexible use. </p><p>[0019] The brewing chambers cannot in fact operate independently. </p><p>[0020] The present invention is aimed at making up for the drawbacks of currently known unit and automatic coffee machines. </p><p>[0021] To do so, it has at least two brewing chambers that are opened and closed by a mobile plate with an orifice. </p><p>[0022] In that way, a unit is made with several brewing chambers, which increases productivity. </p><p>[0023] Further, the assembly unifies the machine in order not to multiply the number of constituent elements by the number of brewing chambers required. </p><p>[0024] According to the invention a simple machine is achieved with compact dimensions containing several brewing chambers. </p><p>[0025] The invention also offers the benefit of having different elements common to the brewing chambers, particularly the mobile plate or the automatic control means, that may be grouped. </p><p>[0026] The other aim of the invention is to make the use of the unit more flexible by enabling it to make just one brew or two simultaneous brews or even make a brew while the other chamber is being filled with coffee or emptied of the used grounds. </p><p>[0027] As a result, the present invention offers the possibility of working concurrently on several brewing chambers. </p><p>[0028] That adds flexibility to the productivity obtained. </p><p>[0029] Other aims and benefits will emerge during the description below, which is however not limitative. </p><p>[0030] The unit for making beverages by brewing of a dose of product to be brewed comprising several brewing chambers, each provided with a receptacle for the dose and means to inject hot water in each of the brewing chambers is characterised by the fact that the brewing chambers are juxtaposed and topped by a mobile plate with an orifice designed to be positioned opposite the brewing chambers for opening or closing the brewing chambers (<b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>) depending on its position. </p><p>[0031] The unit according to the invention may be embodied in the modes outlined below: </p><p>[0032] there is a seal between each brewing chamber and the mobile plate; </p><p>[0033] the injection means are composed of radial supply circuits that open out into each brewing chamber; </p><p>[0034] the lower wall of the receptacle is created by a mobile piston that moves between a position for receiving the dose to a position for ejecting the dose into the orifice when it is used; </p><p>[0035] the shape of the section of the orifice is identical to that of the opening of the brewing chambers, while its dimensions are slightly greater; </p><p>[0036] the perimeter of the orifice is at least as thick as the maximum height of the used dose ejected after brewing, </p><p>[0037] the used dose is ejected by gravity when the mobile plate moves; </p><p>[0038] the plate is a mobile disc rotating in a horizontal plane, </p><p>[0039] the said unit has two brewing chambers positioned under the plate so that they are in the path of the orifice; </p><p>[0040] it comprises the automatic means to load a dose of a product to be brewed, including </p><p>[0041] an assembly for supplying the brewing product that opens out onto at least one supply channel, </p><p>[0042] a funnel that receives the dose by gravity from the supply channel/s, the lower end of which opens at the mobile plate, </p><p>[0043] the means to position the funnel above one of the brewing chambers in order to load a dose in one of the brewing chambers when the orifice is positioned above it; </p><p>[0044] the shape and dimensions of the lower end of the funnel are more or less similar to those of the openings of the brewing chambers; </p><p>[0045] the means to position the funnel opposite to one of the two brewing chambers comprise: </p><p>[0046] a vertical shaft pivot link with a return mechanism, </p><p>[0047] a driving pin fixed on the outer wall of the funnel that works along with an annular part on the perimeter of the mobile plate to direct the funnel into one of the three positions below: </p><p>[0048] the idle position when the driving pin is fitted in a notch formed on the annular part, the brewing chambers being placed symmetrically on either side of the idle position; </p><p>[0049] the position opposite to one of the brewing chambers when the driving pin presses on the portion of the annual part that is located on the first side of the notch; </p><p>[0050] the position opposite to the other brewing chamber when the driving pin presses on the portion of the annular part that is located on the other side of the notch; </p><p>[0051] the means to make the funnel vibrate in order to make the brewing material drop down. </p><p>[0052] at least one area of each portion of the annular part is raised to make the funnel vibrate when the driving pin passes over it; </p><p>[0053] the means to clean the orifice when the used dose is removed, including the following: </p><p>[0054] a weight, the section of which has the same shape and is slightly smaller than the section of the orifice, </p><p>[0055] the means to suspend the weight so that it can be moved in and out of the orifice. </p><p>[0056] the suspension means include: </p><p>[0057] a horizontal shaft pivot link, </p><p>[0058] an articulation to lower or raise the weight so as to insert it into the orifice and take it out when the mobile plate moves; </p><p>[0059] the weight has a sectional profile in order to facilitate insertion into and removal from the orifice; </p><p>[0060] the weight is fitted on a rod connected to the horizontal shaft pivot by an annular linear link in order to make it easier for it to move in and out of the orifice. </p><p>[0061] The invention also concerns an automatic machine for making espresso type beverages with at least one unit as described in the invention.</p><p>[0062] The drawings enclosed are provided as examples for guidance and are not limitative. They represent the preferred mode of embodiment of the invention. They make it easier to understand the invention. </p><p>[0063]FIG. 1 is a general perspective view of a unit for making beverages as described in the invention, in a particular mode of embodiment. </p><p>[0064]FIG. 2 is a sectional view of the brewing chambers of the embodiment of FIG. 1. </p><p>[0065] FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>5</b> are schematic top views of the unit as described in the invention, illustrating the three possible positions of the mobile plate. </p><p>[0066] FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>9</b> are schematic sectional views showing different phases of unit operation as described in the invention.</p><p>[0067] Below is a description of the preferred embodiment mode as illustrated in FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>9</b>. </p><p>[0068] It includes a unit for brewing beverages, particularly coffee of the espresso type. </p><p>[0069] The unit according to the invention includes several brewing chambers in which product such as ground coffee is brewed. </p><p>[0070] All the figures show the embodiment with two brewing chambers referenced <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0071] Both chambers include receptacles referenced <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, the interior volume of which can receive a dose <b>3</b> of product to be brewed. </p><p>[0072]FIG. 6 shows the reception of the dose in the receptacle. </p><p>[0073] Means to inject hot water for brewing are also present in each of the brewing chambers, <b>1</b><i>a</i>and <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0074] The preferred mode of embodiment will be described below. </p><p>[0075] According to the invention, brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>are juxtaposed as shown in FIG. 2. </p><p>[0076] Besides, they are topped by a mobile plate <b>4</b> with an orifice <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0077] Depending on the position of the mobile plate <b>4</b>, orifice <b>5</b> may be positioned opposite of one of the brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>or <b>1</b><i>b </i>so as to open it. </p><p>[0078] When orifice <b>5</b> is not positioned opposite of a brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>a </i>or <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the relevant chamber is closed. </p><p>[0079]FIG. 2 shows the case of two closed brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0080]FIG. 6 shows another possibility where one of the chambers (<b>1</b><i>b</i>) is open. </p><p>[0081] It appears quite clearly that the formation of a single plate <b>4</b> provided with an orifice <b>5</b> assure openings and closings phase of the both brewing chambers, la and <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0082] In the preferred embodiment mode shown in FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b>, plate <b>4</b> rotates along an axis <b>13</b>, shown particularly in FIG. 2. </p><p>[0083] However, other forms of embodiment are possible, particularly those that enable the displacement of plate <b>4</b>. </p><p>[0084] In the preferred embodiment, the closing of brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>is sealed by a seal <b>6</b> between each chamber <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>and mobile plate <b>4</b>. </p><p>[0085] Seal <b>6</b> is particularly shown in FIG. 2 in the form of an o-ring seal, as an example. </p><p>[0086]FIG. 2 also shows the means to inject hot water, made up of radial supply circuits <b>7</b> that open out into each brewing chamber, <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0087] Before these radial supply circuits <b>7</b>, the means of injection may be made up with the usual method, particularly by using a pump and solenoid valve brewing system <b>12</b> as shown in FIG. 1. </p><p>[0088] Radial injection of hot water makes it possible to avoid the need for plate <b>4</b> to bear the means of injection. </p><p>[0089] The preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 2 also includes a circuit for letting out the brewed beverage through an outlet referenced <b>41</b>. </p><p>[0090] As part of that system, the removal circuit to outlet <b>41</b> includes a mobile piston <b>10</b> that makes up lower wall <b>9</b> of the receptacles <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0091] Preferentially, mobile piston <b>10</b> has a filter <b>42</b> that lets the beverage through to outlet <b>41</b>. </p><p>[0092] The use of a mobile piston <b>10</b> makes it possible to vary the interior volume of receptacles <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0093] It can also be adapted on the basis of the dose <b>3</b> integrated into the receptacle or the required tamping of the grounds. </p><p>[0094] Besides, the displacement of piston <b>6</b> means that it can pass from a position for receiving dose <b>3</b> and a position for ejecting dose <b>3</b> into orifice <b>5</b> when it is used. </p><p>[0095] By reference to FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b>, it may be seen that brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b </i>of FIG. 6 shows the position of mobile piston <b>10</b> to receive dose <b>3</b>. </p><p>[0096] In FIG. 7, that same brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b </i>is closed and mobile piston <b>10</b> is raised to tamp dose <b>3</b>. </p><p>[0097] After the brewing is completed, FIG. 8 shows the ejection of dose <b>3</b> out of receptacle <b>2</b><i>b </i>by the full deployment of piston <b>10</b>. </p><p>[0098] Used dose <b>3</b> is thus collected from mobile plate into orifice <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0099] In the preferred embodiment, orifice <b>5</b> has a section with an identical shape and a slightly larger size that the openings of the brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0100] In the example in the various figures, brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>and orifice <b>5</b> have a circular section with a diameter that is approximately equal, with a difference of a few millimetres. </p><p>[0101] Not only does mobile plate <b>4</b> take part in ejecting dose <b>3</b> out of brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, but it also makes it possible to remove the used dose <b>3</b> outside the unit. </p><p>[0102] To that end, the thickness of the perimeter of orifice <b>5</b> is almost equal to the maximum height of used dose <b>3</b> ejected after brewing. </p><p>[0103]FIG. 8 clearly shows that configuration. </p><p>[0104] Besides, the removal of used dose <b>3</b> present in orifice <b>5</b> takes place by gravity after the movement of mobile plate <b>4</b> as shown in FIG. 9. </p><p>[0105] Used dose <b>3</b> can thus be collected in any container. </p><p>[0106] In the preferred embodiment as shown in the figures, plate <b>4</b> is a mobile disc that rotates on a horizontal plane. </p><p>[0107] Besides, the unit preferentially contains two brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, positioned on plate <b>4</b>. </p><p>[0108] Orifice <b>5</b> and brewing chambers <b>1</b> <i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>are placed so that the orifice is placed opposite one of the two chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>or <b>1</b><i>b </i>when plate <b>4</b> rotates. </p><p>[0109] That rotation may take place around an axis <b>13</b> by means of a motorised system <b>14</b> made up of usual elements, particularly a geared motor and a driving system like the one shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. </p> <p>[0110] Likewise, mobile piston <b>10</b> may be displaced by a common motorising system referenced <b>11</b>. </p> <p>[0111] In order to ensure a fully automated beverage brewing cycle, the unit includes an assembly <b>15</b> that supplies the brewing material. </p><p>[0112] Assembly <b>15</b> shown in FIG. 1 opens out onto at least one supply channel <b>16</b>. </p> <p>[0113] Beneath channels <b>16</b>, a funnel <b>17</b> can receive the dose of the brewing material <b>3</b> by means of gravity. </p><p>[0114] Also, the lower end <b>18</b> of funnel <b>17</b> opens out onto mobile plate <b>4</b> as shown in FIG. 2. Funnel <b>17</b> shown in the figures has shape that is more or less flared at its upper end as compared to its lower end <b>18</b>. </p><p>[0115] However, the invention is not limited to such a configuration and particularly, a funnel with a constant section over its entire height may be used. </p><p>[0116] In order to load dose <b>3</b> into one of the brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>or <b>1</b><i>b</i>, it is necessary to position the lower end <b>18</b> above one of the chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>or <b>1</b><i>b </i>and at the same time, to place opening <b>5</b> above it as well. </p><p>[0117] Positioning means are provided to position funnel <b>17</b>. </p><p>[0118] In the preferred embodiment, the means have a pivot link <b>21</b> shown schematically in FIG. 3 and a rotation axis referenced <b>20</b>. </p><p>[0119] As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the pivot link <b>21</b> enables funnel <b>17</b> to move between a right-hand position and a left-hand position, while making it possible to have an intermediate position as shown in FIG. 3, between the two extreme positions. </p><p>[0120] A driving system for funnel <b>17</b> is provided in order to position the funnel in one of the three configurations shown in FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>. </p><p>[0121] The positioning means contain a driving pin referenced <b>22</b> fixed to the outer wall of funnel <b>17</b>, which projects out towards the outside of mobile plate <b>4</b>. </p><p>[0122] Also, an annular part <b>23</b> is built on the perimeter of the mobile plate <b>4</b>, such as an edge. </p><p>[0123] That annular part <b>23</b> works together with positioning pin <b>22</b>. </p><p>[0124] To do so, annular part <b>23</b> has a notch <b>24</b> in which the pin <b>22</b> fits when it is in the idle position as shown in FIG. 3. </p><p>[0125] It must be considered in the top view that brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>are formed symmetrically around the idle position, around the symmetry axis referenced <b>25</b>. </p><p>[0126] To turn funnel <b>17</b> to the right in order to reach the position of FIG. 4, mobile plate <b>4</b> is made to rotate in the trigonometric direction so that driving pin <b>22</b> presses against the corresponding portion of annular par <b>23</b>. </p><p>[0127] In this case, driving pin <b>22</b> presses against portion <b>26</b> of annular part <b>23</b>. </p><p>[0128] To reach the pivoted position shown in FIG. 5, driving pin <b>22</b> presses against portion <b>27</b> of annular part <b>23</b> located on the other side of notch <b>24</b>. </p><p>[0129] There too, the displacement of mobile plate <b>4</b> ensures such pressing. </p><p>[0130] It is achieved by rotating mobile plate <b>4</b> clockwise from the idle position shown in FIG. 3. </p><p>[0131] As indicated for the shapes and dimensions of orifice <b>5</b> and the opening of brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the lower end <b>18</b> of funnel <b>17</b> preferentially has a shape and dimensions similar to those of the opening of brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0132] In that way, the brewing material is transferred without any hindrance. </p><p>[0133] In order to enable the brewing material to drop into funnel <b>17</b> without retaining any of it on the internal walls of funnel <b>17</b>, the unit has the means to make tunnel vibrate. </p><p>[0134] Such vibration can particularly be achieved by forming a raised part <b>28</b> on the annular part <b>23</b> of mobile plate <b>4</b> as shown in FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0135] These figures show the raised part <b>28</b>, particularly in the form of stripes on the internal vertical wall of the annular part <b>23</b>. </p><p>[0136] The raised part vibrates funnel <b>17</b> when driving pin <b>22</b> passes over raised part <b>28</b>. </p><p>[0137] In another embodiment, the unit includes the means to clean orifice <b>5</b> when used dose <b>3</b> is removed. </p><p>[0138] A particular form of removal means has been illustrated in the figures containing a weight <b>29</b> mounted on means of suspension <b>30</b> used to move weight <b>29</b> in and out of orifice <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0139] Weight <b>29</b> has a section with the same shape and a slightly smaller size than the section of orifice <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0140] In that way, weight <b>29</b> scrapes the walls of orifice <b>5</b> in order to remove any residue of brewing material. </p><p>[0141] The means of suspension <b>30</b> may be achieved as described below. </p><p>[0142] First of all, a horizontal axis pivot link <b>31</b> is formed so that weight <b>29</b> can swing depending on the position of plate <b>4</b> as shown in the top view in FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>. </p><p>[0143] Secondly, articulation <b>32</b>, also referenced in FIG. 1, lowers and raises weight <b>29</b> so that it is inserted into and removed from orifice <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0144] The axis pivot link <b>31</b> may be made up of a support <b>38</b> for the weight and a bracket <b>37</b> connect to frame <b>36</b> of the unit. </p><p>[0145] Articulation <b>32</b> may be formed by the link between bracket <b>37</b> and frame <b>36</b>. </p><p>[0146] These kinematical links may be made using usual means, particularly using screwed systems. </p><p>[0147] In the preferred mode, weight <b>29</b> is also given freedom of movement in relation to support <b>38</b>. </p><p>[0148] To do so, an annular linear link <b>35</b> is made up in order to make it easier to move in and out of orifice <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0149] For example, the annular linear link is formed by making a orifice <b>40</b> that is more or less vertical in support <b>38</b>, working along with a rod <b>34</b>, at the lower end of which is fixed weight <b>29</b> and mounted on support <b>38</b> so that head <b>39</b> of rod <b>34</b> with a section greater than orifice <b>40</b> presses against orifice <b>40</b> from the top. </p><p>[0150] Rod <b>34</b> is therefore enabled to move vertically in relation to support <b>38</b>. </p><p>[0151] To make it easier for weight <b>29</b> to move in and out of orifice <b>5</b>, a weight <b>29</b> will be used preferentially, with a sectional profile <b>33</b>. </p><p>[0152] In that way, a weight <b>29</b> can be made with a maximum section that is very slightly smaller than that of the section of orifice <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0153] The shape of the sectional profile <b>33</b> is presented in the various figures, particularly FIG. 2. </p><p>[0154] It eliminates the risk of weight <b>29</b> jamming in orifice <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0155] Below is a description of the various unit operating stages in the invention, in the particular embodiment mode illustrated in the figures and particularly FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>9</b>. </p><p>[0156]FIG. 6 contains a phase in which a dose of brewing material <b>3</b> is introduced in brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b</i>, into its receptacle <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0157] Such introduction is possible by placing the mobile plate <b>4</b> in such a way that orifice <b>5</b> is above receptacle <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0158] Besides, the positioning of mobile plate <b>4</b> drives funnel <b>17</b>, which is also positioned above the opening of receptacle <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0159] Now the supply assembly <b>15</b> can be made to operate to transfer the brewing material (such as ground coffee) into brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0160] As illustrated in FIG. 1, the supply means <b>15</b> may contain several grinders <b>19</b> that can grind coffee beans to make ground coffee. </p><p>[0161] When a dose is introduced in this way in brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b</i>, it may be closed by another phase of rotation of mobile plate <b>4</b>. </p><p>[0162] Now the position shown in FIG. 7 is possible, where chamber <b>1</b><i>b </i>is closed and funnel <b>17</b> and weight <b>29</b> are in the idle position that is more or less as shown in the top view of FIG. 3. </p><p>[0163] At this point, the brew may be made by the radial injection of hot water into the brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b </i>through supply circuit <b>7</b>. </p><p>[0164] In FIG. 7, arrows illustrate the passage of water from the supply circuit <b>7</b> to outlet <b>41</b>. </p><p>[0165] The beverage is then collected in the usual way. </p><p>[0166] Before the brewing phase starts, mobile piston <b>10</b> can be raised in order to tamp the brewing material. </p><p>[0167] When the brewing is completed, the used dose <b>3</b> is ejected out of brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b </i>as represented in FIG. 8. </p><p>[0168] To do so, mobile plate <b>4</b> is positioned so that orifice <b>5</b> is above the opening of receptacle <b>2</b><i>b </i>of brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0169] Now, mobile piston <b>10</b> can move so that dose <b>3</b> is collected in orifice <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0170] A new rotation of mobile plate <b>4</b> in the opposite direction makes it possible to remove dose <b>3</b> by the action of gravity. </p><p>[0171] The removal stage is represented in FIG. 9. </p><p>[0172] To that end, weight <b>29</b> makes removal easier and ensures that no brewing material remains on the perimeter of orifice <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0173] It must be noted that while the various stages are being performed in brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b</i>, brewing chamber la can operate independently. </p><p>[0174] For instance, FIG. 7 illustrates the possibility of simultaneous brewing in brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0175] Brewing may also continue as brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b </i>is being filled (FIG. 6) or while the used dose <b>3</b> is being ejected (FIG. 8) or removed (FIG. 9). </p><p>[0176] Likewise, the filling, brewing, ejection and removal phases of brewing chamber la may occur when brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b </i>is operating. </p><p>[0177] In the example show, mobile plate <b>4</b> rotates around an idle position shown in FIG. 3. </p><p>[0178] Mobile plate <b>4</b> can be made to rotate around that position in either direction depending on the operations to be completed, either vis-à-vis brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>b </i>or brewing chamber <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p><p>[0179] In the preferred mode, all the unit operating cycles are automated in order to optimise the productivity and ease of use for the user. </p><p>[0180] In particular, it can be seen that the use of such an operating cycle does away with the need to double all the operating controls of brewing chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0181] Of course, means may be provided to detect the position of mobile plate <b>4</b> so that it stops in exactly the different desired positions for the loading, removal and ejection of dose <b>3</b> and the closing of chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b.
