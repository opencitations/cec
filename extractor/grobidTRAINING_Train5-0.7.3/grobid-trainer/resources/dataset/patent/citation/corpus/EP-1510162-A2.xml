blending apparatus which comprises a body portion 3 (Fig 2) consisting of a plastics vessel
in the shape of a beaker having a base 3A, upwardly diverging, circular cross section side
walls 3B and an upper edge 3c of the container. The container is nestable with other
containers, when empty, by location of the base through the upper opening of another
container. A handle may be provided on the side wall 3B extending outwards from the upper
end of the body, above the level of a container with which it is nested, the handle also being
nestable.</p><p num="0011">In its base 3A the container is formed with a peripheral downwardly projection portion 3D
and centrally of the base 3A is formed a hollow, upwardly extending location member 3E.
The member 3E is closed at its upper end and is of truncated cone shape having an opening
3F at its lower end accessible from the outside of the container. The opening 3F has a
rectangular shape as shown in the lower part of Fig 2 for location of the container on a
support, to be described but may be of any other suitable shape. An annular recess 3G
extends around the member 3E and opens into the internal volume of the container. The
location member 3E may not be hollow, in some applications, and may be formed of foamed
plastics.</p><p num="0012">The container body or vessel 3 is provided with a closure member 2 (Figs 4A and 4B)
constituting a lid arranged to fit over the upper end of the body 3 over the upper edge 3C and
to close the opening at the top of the body. The lid 2 is generally circular having an outer
portion 2A which fits over the upper edge 3C of the body to be sealingly engaged over the
opening. This may be by a clip arrangement, by heat sealing, or by any other suitable means
for securing the lid 2 on the body 3. The container body 3 may also, or instead, have its
upper opening sealed with a diaphragm or film heat sealed thereto. The lid (when fitted) may
have cutters (not shown) on its underside to cut an opening in the diaphragm for a straw.</p><p num="0013">At the centre of the lid is formed an opening 5 through which drive means, to be described, 
extends during a blending operation. After the container has been filled and during transport
prior to a blending operation the opening is sealed with a removable seal 5A usually
adhesively attached to the lid 2 and having a tab 5B by which it is peeled off. Instead of the
seal 5A the lid may have a moulded-in, removable section. A bung 5C may be located in the
opening 5 after the sealing member 5A has been removed and after a blending operation.
Alternatively the removable section may be relocated in the opening after blending.</p><p num="0014">The assembly also includes a blending element 7 (Figs 3A and 3B) which is arranged for
location in the container over the location means 3E and for rotation relative to the container
and location means. The blending element 7 comprises a hollow, circular section body 8
open at its lower end 9 and being of generally frustro conical shape arranged to fit over the
correspondingly shaped location member 3E. Impeller blades 12 are located in pairs axially
spaced along the element 7 and extending outwardly from the central axis in the radial
direction. The blades 12 in each pair extend from opposite sides of the element 7 and are
angled to the horizontal to impart a blending action on the contents of the container. The
blending element 7 is provided with longitudinal slots at opposite sides extending partway
along the length of element from its lower end, which slots are to accommodate the blades
12 when the element 7 is nested with other elements, as seen in Fig 6. Instead of the blades
12 being arranged as shown, blades at different positions may have different shapes and
orientation for different functions e.g. blending and circulation. Moreover the blades 12 may
fold over and avoid the need for the slots to nest the elements, or the blades may be small
enough to be received in another element. If the product requires stirring rather than
vigorous blending, stirring paddles may replace the blades</p><p num="0015">At the upper end of the element 7 there is provided an opening 13 the inner sides of which
are shaped to receive, in driving engagement therewith, drive means for driving the blending
element during a blending operation.</p><p num="0016">Referring now particularly to Figs 5-8 there will be described the sequence for assembling
and filling the container assembly. In Fig 5 there is shown in the upper part a stack of nested
container bodies 3 from which the lower container body has been released. The body of 
Fig 5 is then assembled with a blending element 7 from a stack of such elements which are
nested together as seen in Fig 6. The blending element 7 is located onto the location member
3E of the container 3. In effecting this assembly the lower edge of the element 7 enters the
annular recess 3G and may be locked in said recess to inhibit axial movement of the element
7 whilst retaining the ability ofthe element 7 to be rotated relative to the body 3. However,
the annular recess may be omitted.</p><p num="0017">The assembled container body 3 and element 7 is then charged or filled with product to be
dispensed by filling means shown diagrammatically at 15 in Fig 7. The filling means 15 may
be of any convenient kind and can be a filling machine ofknown form which fills the body
3 with the product P up to the desired level within the body 3.</p><p num="0018">After filling a closure member 2 is detached from a stack of closure members as seen in Fig
8 and is secured to the upper opening of the body 3 to seal the contents ofthe container. The
closure member 2 may be in the form of a membrane heat-sealed to the upper edge of the
body of the container with or without a further lid. The membrane may be punctured to gain
access for the drive means and for a straw. The membrane if fitted as well as a lid, will be
applied before the lid fitting step.</p><p num="0019">After filling and fitting of the closure member the container may be overwrapped with film
which may be heat-shrunk around a part or all of the container, the film carrying printed
material and being pierceable to access the drive and straw into the container.</p><p num="0020">This completes the assembly and charging of the container with product and the container
may be filled aseptically and/or may be frozen or semi-frozen subsequent to filling.
Alternatively the filled container may be chilled.</p><p num="0021">The filled containers are transported and stored in their frozen or chilled condition or at
ambient temperature until it is required to consume the product. Before consumption frozen
or semi-frozen product within the container assembly may be tempered i.e. brought to a
higher blending temperature, for example in a tempering cabinet, and is then subjected to 
a blending operation which is performed in a blending apparatus such as shown in Fig 9.</p><p num="0022">The blending apparatus comprises a support for the container assembly which includes a
seating surface 21 from which there is an upwardly extending location element 22 which is
located into the opening 3F of the location member 3E of the container 3. The location
element 22 has an outer profile corresponding to the profile of the opening 3F so that the
container assembly is secured against rotation relative to the location element 22. The
location element 22 may extend towards the upper end of the opening 3F or, as shown in the
scrap view in Fig 9, the location element 22 may extend only along the lower end of the
opening 3F. The provision of the location element 22 fixes the container assembly securely
to the apparatus during blending. Howeverthe element 22 may be omitted and the container
assembly held by the engagement of the drive means or by interfitting portions of the surface
21 with the container base. The location element 22 may be heated so as to heat the product
in the container and assist the blending action.</p><p num="0023">Once in position the container assembly lies directly below a drive motor 25 having a drive
output shaft 26 arranged for driving engagement with the blending element 7 by location in
the opening 13. The motor 25 and associated shaft 26 is moveably mounted through an arm
27 guided along a guide rod 28 between an operational position as shown in Fig 9 and a
raised position in which the shaft 26 is clear of the container assembly. Movement between
these positions may be by a further drive motor 29 by which the shaft 28 is rotated to move
the arm 27 along the shaft by threaded engagement therewith by a linear drive, or otherwise.
Alternatively the arm 27 may be manually moveable between an operative and inoperative
position. As a further alternative the container may be lifted up to locate with the drive.</p><p num="0024">The drive motor 25 and shaft 26 are operated to rotate the blending element 7 relative to the
body 3 at a suitable speed and for a suitable duration, for the blades 12 to blend the product
P within the container. Due to the blades 12 being located throughout the height of the
container the whole contents of the container are quickly blended. The speed of rotation may
vary during a blending sequence and the drive direction may be reversible. Instead of a drive
motor the element 7 may be manually rotated. </p><p num="0025">In one arrangement the containers, after blending, are moved from the blending position to
an adjacent position, as shown in Fig 9, for removal from the location element 22 and
subsequent consumption. Consumption may be through a straw which is inserted into the
container through a weakened area of the closure 2. Alternatively the closure 2 may be
removed from the container body 3. As a further alteration a further lid may be fitted at this
stage.</p><p num="0026">The blending mechanism may incorporate a carousel 30 (Fig 11) on which a plurality of
filled containers are located rotatable about the central axis. At one position 31 of the
containers on the carousel 30 the containers are in a blending position; that is arranged for
driving engagement with a drive shaft. After blending the blended container is moved to a
delivery or collection point 32 which lies adjacent a dispenser 33 for straws. There may also
be a mechanism 34 for operating the carousel and dispensing mechanism for self service
situations. After the container at 31 has been blended the carousel rotates to bring another
container to the blending position and the location from which the blended container has
been released is filled with a fresh filled container.</p><p num="0027">Referring to Fig 9A a similar blending apparatus to that of Fig 9 is shown. In this case the
container assembly is located within a support 35 having a handle 35A during blending and,
after blending, the assembly is lifted with the support 35 off the apparatus. The support 35
may be heated to raise the temperature of product in the container. The support may also be
hinged to the base to permit entry and removal of the container.</p><p num="0028">Referring now to Fig 10 there is shown in side elevation an arrangement incorporating the
carousel arrangement of Fig 12. In this drawing can be seen the carousel 30 on which the
filled containers are supported. When the containers at 31 are to be blended a mandrel 36 is
inserted into the lower opening 3F of the container and raises the container towards a motor
25 and associated shaft 26 located above the container until the shaft is in driving
engagement with the impeller 7. The motor 25 is operated to blend the contents of the
container, the mandrel is withdrawn downwards and the container is then moved sideways
after withdrawal of the mandrel 36 to a delivery point 32 from which the container can be 
accessed. Above each of the positions on the carousel 30 there is a vertical column of filled
containers which can pass under gravity into the space on the carousel vacated by the blended
container released by a mechanical release mechanism. There is provided an enclosure 37
in which the columns of containers and the blending mechanism are located and which may
be refrigerated or heated to enable the containers to be maintained at the desired temperature
level. In Fig 10A there is a similar arrangement to Fig 10 except that the columns of
containers are inclined to enable the columns to be recharged through a front opening in the
enclosure 37. A dual channel electronic controller may be used for temperature control in
the enclosure 37 controlling operation of heating means and cooling means according to the
sensed temperature.</p><p num="0029">The delivery point 32 can include a microwave unit at which the product may be heated.
Blending of product can also take place at this point.</p><p num="0030">Referring now to Figs 12 and 13 there is shown a storage system for storing filled container
assemblies. In Fig 13 is shown a storage unit consisting of an insulated housing 42 in which
is located, one above the other, platforms 43 which are removably locatable in the housing.</p><p num="0031">Each platform 43 is generally circular and has an array of upwardly projecting location
mandrels 22 which extend upwards into the container assemblies mounted thereon. The
platform 43 and mandrels 22 are preferably of heat conducting material, such as aluminium,
such that heat is conducted between the container contents and the interior of the housing.
In this way the temperature of the contents of the containers is adjusted according to the
temperature within the housing, and the contents of may be heated up (tempered) or cooled
down to a predetermined temperature. Since the mandrels extend internally of the containers
heat transfer takes place from without to within and from within to without the containers.
Preferably the housing is kept at the desired tempering temperature or within a predetermined
range of that temperature by heating/cooling means. A forced air circulation system may be
used together with heating/cooling means to maintain the desired temperature of the product.
The mandrels 22 may be omitted.

The circular platforms 43 may be used in the form of a carousel, as previously described, and 
removable, with the associated containers, from the housing. After dispensing of the
contents of the container assemblies the platforms are recharged with filled assemblies for
tempering or otherwise. The carousel can be manually or automatically rotated.</p><p num="0032">Referring now to Figs 14 and 15 there is shown an alternative construction for the upper end
of the blending element 7 and for the closure 2.</p><p num="0033">The blending element 7 is formed with an opening 13 for receiving the drive shaft for the
element which opening is shaped with drive dogs 13A. The outer sides of the drive dogs
13A are arranged within a downwardly and outwardly directed, circular portion 13B of the
lid 2.</p><p num="0034">The drive dogs 13A extend upwards from the upper end of the element 7 which has a cap 7A
closing said upper end. On the lower side of the cap 7A is formed a part-spherical member
7B which is directed downwards and which is arranged to engage the upper end of the
member 3E which is formed with a complementary depression. The member 7B and the
depression provide bearing surfaces during rotation of the element 7. In Fig 14 is shown a
straw 40 extending through a frangible opening in the lid 2.</p><p num="0035">After blending and consumption of product within the container assembly it is intended that
the assembly be discarded but the components of the assembly maybe constructed to be
recyclable. The invention provides a container assembly which is readily manufactured from
plastics mouldings, there being three main components and the components being readily
assembled. Moreover before assembly the components are capable of being stored in a
compact fashion by being nestable with one another. Due to the construction of the blending
impeller an efficient blending action can be performed on the product even if the product is
not of equal consistency throughout the container and even if it contains relatively viscous
components. Accordingly the blending operation is efficient and quickly effected for a
variety of products.</p><p num="0036">The blending impeller, although located internally of the container, takes up relatively little 
space and does not materially affect the capacity of the container which can, if necessary, be
of slightly enlarged diameter and/or depth to accommodate the loss of capacity.</p><p num="0037">By the provision of the longitudinal opening 3F of the container any tempering of the filled
containers to a blending temperature is more quickly effected. Tempering of the frozen
containers is also readily achieved in a storage system as seen in Figs 10 &amp; 11 by circulation
of tempering air throughout the housing 37.</p><p num="0038">The assembly requires no special sub assembly of components prior to shipping the
components from the supplier or at the location where the containers are filled. The seal 5A
for the lid 2 may be attached to the lid prior to or after distribution to filling site. In addition
the container may be filled with product by pre existing filling machines.</p><p num="0039">The apparatus may be adapted to enable additional ingredients to be added to the container
prior to, during or after the blending operation. Such ingredients may include flavouring
aeration means, carbonation means, heating medium such as steam and/or solids such as ice,
nuts, chocolate etc.... The container closure may be formed with means for permitting such
ingredients to be added such as openings for the entry of tubes. The closure may be recessed
at its edge for such a purpose.</p><p num="0040">In making the additions to the container the container should be accurately located during the
introduction of such additions to ensure that the tube or other means for making the additions
can access the container at a defined position.</p><p num="0041">The apparatus may also find application for heated product and at the blending/dispensing
stage the product may be heated, for example by microwave heating means .</p><p num="0042">Referring now particularly to Figs 18 and 19 in which the same reference numbers are used
for similar parts to those in the previously described embodiment, there is shown apparatus
by which the food product within the container 1 is heated and blended prior to consumption.
It will be appreciated that the container body 3 is charged with food product with the lid or 
closure 2 not present, and with the blending element 7 in position in the container so that the
food product substantially fills or partially fills the container body. The lid 2 is then located
on the container 3 to seal product within the container.</p><p num="0043">For the purposes of the present invention the filled container is then frozen to a storage
temperature at which the food product will be preserved for substantial periods. Such
temperature may be of the order of -20°C and is a temperature at which the food product
cannot be readily blended. In order to bring the food product to a blending temperature prior
to a blending operation the food product may be tempered in a tempering cabinet. to a
blending temperature which may be of the order of -4°. In the present case however the
apparatus of Figs 18 and 19 is intended to enable the food product to reach a blending
temperature quickly and without the use of a tempering cabinet.</p><p num="0044">The heating and blending apparatus of Figs 18 and 19 includes a main housing 50 defining
within it a compartment 51 in which the heating and blending operation takes place. A
holder 52 is provided in which the container 1 is locatable, the holder 52 defining an interior
space and the container seats in the space with its side walls in contact with the walls of the
holder. If required the holder 52 includes a central upwardly directed portion shaped to
locate into the hollow location member 3E to secure the container.</p><p num="0045">The holder 52 is movable in a horizontal direction between the position shown in Fig 18,
from which the container can be loaded into and out of the holder 52, and an operating
position shown in Fig 19 in which the holder 52 and container 1 are within the compartment
51. Movement between these positions is achieved by drive means 53 which conveniently
includes a piston and cylinder arrangement of which a cylinder 54 is fixed within the
housing 50 and a piston rod 55 extends out of the piston 54 for movement relative to the
cylinder. Alternatively a linear drive may be used.</p><p num="0046">The compartment 51 defines a region in which microwave radiation can be directed to the
food product within the container 1 whereby to heat the food product from the low, frozen
temperature to a higher, blending temperature. The microwave radiation is arranged to heat 
up the food product by known means but using focused radiation whereby it is the volume
occupied by the food product which receives the radiation in a directed way. The holder 52
is preferably provided with temperature detection means (not shown) whereby when the
container is placed in the holder 52 the temperature of the food product is detected. This may
be by temperature detecting means located outside of the compartment 51 or by temperature
detection means within the compartment, for example infra-red temperature detection means.
The temperature detected may vary and hence the duration of heating may need to be varied
according to the temperature of product in the container compared with the temperature to
which the product is to be brought for a blending operation. The duration of heating is
calculated so that the heating means operates for the predetermined time which may be ofthe
order of 10-30 seconds, depending also on the power of the microwave heating means and
the size ofthe container. Usually the blending temperature ofthe food product will be of the
order of -3°C to -4 °C compared with an initial temperature of about -20°C.</p><p num="0047">It will be appreciated that the compartment 51, when closed, provides shield means for the
microwave radiation and there is provided a door 56 which is lowered into position to close
the compartment 51 when the holder 52 is located within the compartment.</p><p num="0048">Upon completion of the heating of the food within the container the product within the
container may be blended. Blending is by operation of a drive motor 60 located above the
compartment 51 and having a drive shaft 61 extending downwardly towards the
compartment 51. To couple the drive shaft 61 to the blending element 7, the shaft 61 is
moved downwardly into engagement into the opening 13 so as to be in driving engagement
with the element 7. Movement of the shaft 61 relative to the motor 60 is achieved by
providing a splined connection 63, the connection moving up and down on an output spline
of the blender motor shaft by means of a U-shaped arm 64 activated up and down by a linear
drive 65.</p><p num="0049">After engagement of the shaft 61 with the blending element 7 and completion of a blending
operation the shaft 61 is withdrawn upwards to resume its initial position. The door 56 is
moved to an open position and the container with its associated holder 52 is ejected from the 
compartment 51 to the position shown in Fig 2. The container with its blended food product
can now be lifted out of the holder 52 and is ready for consumption.</p><p num="0050">It will be appreciated that the components of the container and holder which enter the
compartment 51 need to be manufactured from material which do not affect the microwave
environment.</p><p num="0051">Usually the tab 5A will be removed from the container before it is introduced into the heating
and blending position but, to avoid the need for removal of such tab, the closure for the
opening may be arranged so that the drive shaft can break through the seal to enter the
opening 13.</p><p num="0052">The holder 52 can be used to assist in directing the microwave energy inside the holder and
the microwave transmission can be either from within the holder, outside the holder or from
both inside and outside the holder 52.</p><p num="0053">The housing 50 can accommodate more than one compartment 51, for example 2-4
compartments. Alternatively a common compartment for multiple containers can be
employed.</p><p num="0054">Flavour additives and aeration of the food product may be achieved by having means such
as inlet tubes (not shown) to introduce such components into the container associated with
the up and down movement of the shaft 61. </p><p num="0055">In Figs 20-21 there is shown further apparatus for heating and blending frozen milkshake
product. The blending arrangement used may be in accordance with the previously described
embodiments having a container 130 into which the product is charged for storage and for
transportation to the point of consumption. The product may be frozen in the container for
storage. The container has a blending element 7, as previously described, for driving
engagement with drive means and to effect a blending action on the product but, before
blending of the frozen product can be effected, the product needs to be heated to raise its
temperature from the storage temperature to a blending and consumption temperature.</p><p num="0056">The illustrated apparatus of Figs 20,21 is intended to enable the heating and blending actions
to be performed successively and for heating of frozen product in a container 130 to be
performed on another part of the apparatus.</p><p num="0057">For the heating and blending actions there is provided a holder 132 which is mounted on an
arm 133 which in turn is moveable vertically along a guide rod 134 supported at its ends on
supports 135 and 136. The arm 133 is moveable in the vertical direction by a drive 137
having a drive rod 138.</p><p num="0058">The container 130 filled with frozen product is located in a compartment 139 of the
apparatus to be subjected to microwave radiation in said compartment in order to heat up the
product to a blending temperature. The microwave radiation is focussed on product within
the container 130 to conserve power, and the duration of the heating is such as to heat up the
product from the low temperature to the desired blending temperature.</p><p num="0059">After heating the container 130 is placed in the holder 132 and is lifted up towards a drive
motor 142 having a drive shaft 43. When the container 130 has reached its upper most
position the drive shaft 143 engages with a blending element (not shown) in the container
130 to effect the blending operation. Thereafter, the holder 132 is lowered again to its initial
position for removal of the container with blended product from the holder 132. If required
the arm 132 may be longitudinally extendable and retractable to present the holder 132 in a
forward position, clear of the compartment 140, in which easier access to the holder 132 may 
be obtained.</p><p num="0060">The holder 132 may be pivoted about a horizontal axis to improve access to containers in the
holder.</p><p num="0061">Referring now to Figs 22A and 22B there is shown another means for locating containers
with products to be heated in a heating compartment 150. In this case the holder 132 is
mounted on one side of a door 140 pivoted about a vertical pivot 141. The container of
product is located in the holder 132 when the door 140 is in the open position (Fig 22B), the
door 140 is pivoted to the closed position (Fig 22A) in which the holder 132 and
accompanying container are located within the compartment 150 to be subjected to
microwave heating. When the heating is completed the door is opened to gain access to the
container.</p><p num="0062">Referring now to Figs 23 and 24 there is shown another form of heating unit again including
a door 140 pivotable about a pivot or hinge 141 to access a heating compartment 150.
within the heating compartment 150 are upper and lowerplates 151 and 152 between which
the container and holder 132 are located when in position in the compartment 150. The two
plates 151 and 152 house microwave guides through which microwave radiation is delivered
to the container and form an enclosed cylinder to give total control of the microwave energy.</p><p num="0063">As another alternative, shown in Fig 30, a cylinder 155 with a vertical axis can be formed
by one half 155A of the cylinder being inside the compartment 150 in a fixed position with
another half 55B mounted on the door 140 so that when the door is closed the two halves
match up to form a cylinder enclosing the container.</p><p num="0064">Referring now to Figs 25,26,27 there is shown another arrangement by which a heating and
blending operation may be performed, these drawings using the same reference numbers for
similar parts to the preceding embodiments.</p><p num="0065">A heating compartment 140 is accessed to introduce a container 130 into a holder 132 
through an opening in the compartment having a door 120 moveable vertically to open and
close the opening. The holder 132 is pivotally mounted about a horizontal axis 156 to tilt and
present the holder 132 for location of the container 130 in the holder (Fig 25). Movement
of the holder after location is towards a vertical position about axis 156. The container is
vertically located during a heating and a blending operation.</p><p num="0066">The holder 132 is mounted on a base portion 157 and is moveable up and down from its
location position, Fig 25, through a heating position Fig 26, to a blending position Fig 27.
In the blending position the container 130, having a blending element31, is engageable by
a drive motor 142 having a drive shaft 142A which is driveably engaged with the blending
element to blend the product within the container 130. Return ofthe container to the position
of Fig 25, after blending, allows the container and blended product to be removed from the
holder. Raising and lowering of the container towards the blending position is achieved by
a vertically reciprocating movement using drive means 158 on the upper end of which the
holder 132 is mounted. The location of the container 130 in and out of the holder 132 may
be made automatically operated for use in, for example, self service applications. For this
purpose the seating may be movable in the horizontal direction to present the holder outside
the compartment 140 to receive a container. After heating and blending the container is
either returned to the initial position or out of the compartment to the opposite side through
a further opening. In the container discharge position the container may be automatically
ejected from the holder.</p><p num="0067">In Fig 29 is shown an arrangement similar to that of Figs 25-27 in which the holder 132 is
movable horizontally to present the holder for location and removal of the container 130
manually or automatically. The holder is mounted on a reciprocal arm 132A for horizontal
movement between a position external to the compartment 140, as shown in Fig 29, and an
internal position within the compartment.</p><p num="0068">In another arrangement (not shown) the compartment in which microwave heating takes
place may be moveable to present the container for a blending/extrusion step. </p><p num="0069">The source of microwave radiation is located in a suitable position in the apparatus.</p><p num="0070">Referring now to Figs 30-34 there is shown a combined heating and blending apparatus for
a similar purpose to the apparatus described with reference to Figures 25-27 and in which the
same reference numerals are used in respect of similar parts. There is shown in these figures
a sequence of steps in manually loading a container 130 into the apparatus, heating the
product within the container 130, and blending the product using the apparatus of the
invention.</p><p num="0071">Fig 30 shows the apparatus ready for use, with the door 120 in the closed position and the
container holder 132 located outside the compartment 140. In Fig 31 the door 120 is moved
to the open position, as shown.</p><p num="0072">In Fig 32 the container 130 is located on the holder 32 which has an upwardly-projecting
member 132A which locates in a corresponding opening in the base of the container 130.
Thus the container 130 seats on the member 132 and 132A. The holder 132 is slidably
movable, as seen in Fig 33 to move the container 130 into the compartment 140 in a
horizontal direction. Upon reaching the position shown in Fig 33 the door120 is closed to
the position shown in Fig 34 and the contents of the container are subjected to heating within
the microwave environment of the compartment 140. After heating to the desired
temperature the contents of the container 130 are blended by engagement of drive means
within the apparatus with the blending element within the container 130.</p><p num="0073">After heating and blending the door 120 is opened, the holder 132 is moved outwardly to its
initial position and the container is removed with the product within the container ready for
consumption.</p><p num="0074">It will be appreciated that by providing heating means used immediately prior to dispensing
of the food product it is no longer necessary to heat up or temper product within a tempering
cabinet. This overcomes problems with tempering cabinets, including problems with stock
rotation which should operate on a "last in, first out" principle but is difficult to achieve. The 
need for tempering cabinets is avoided. Moreover the use of tempering cabinets usually
involves opening and closing access doors which allows heat into the cabinet. In addition
tempering cabinets can usually only be satisfactory if the product dispensing temperature for
all products within the cabinet is the same in each case. Without tempering or heating up a
frozen product extrusion or blending of standard product formulations is difficult to achieve.</p><p num="0075">A further problem with tempering cabinets is that ice can build up within the cabinet,
requiring ice removal.</p><p num="0076">Although these problems can be overcome it may sometimes require a special formulation
of product to achieve this. The use of heating apparatus prior to dispensing with the
possibility of individual control of the heating operation for each container permits standard
existing formulation of product to be employed and tempering cabinets to be avoided
altogether.</p><p num="0077">The product container can readily be applied with information to determine the amount of
heating required, according to the container contents, in each case. For each product a
different heating operation can be performed and there is also provision for detecting the
temperature of the product before entry into the heating environment.</p><p num="0078">By the use of microwave heating for the specific product container the microwave radiation
can be directed specifically at the space occupied by the product and is very confined
resulting in efficient use of microwave energy.</p><p num="0079">The holder my be sanitised after each blending or extrusion step by microwave radiation
assisted by a water spray on the holder which is thus subjected to microwave heating to
sterilise.</p><p num="0080">Bar coding may be used on the product containers to monitor product and other
characteristics which may be useful to the operator such as price, 'sell by' date and stock
control information. </p><p num="0081">Instead of the heating time for the product being calculated automatically the operative can
operate the timer according to the product within the container and the temperature of the
product by providing controls, such as push buttons or touch pads, representing target
temperatures for the product to be heated. Controls may be provided according to the input
temperatures and for the output temperatures. The need for an input temperature scanner can
then be avoided. In another arrangement the time taken for heating can be varied by
adjusting the power input for the microwave heating unit.</p><p num="0082">In another arrangement the heating effect achieved can be tested at the commencement of
blending. This can be by measuring the power (through the current taken by the blending
motor) at the commencement of blending. If this exceeds a predetermined amount it will
indicated that the product is insufficiently heated and further heating is required. After
further microwave heating blending can again be attempted. This cycle can be repeated until
adequate heating has taken place. Circuitry to memorise the heating duration is then
activated so that the next container is subjected to the same amount ofheating as the previous
container. As a further feature and to enable preset heating for different products requiring
different heating times, there may be provided different actuators selected by the operator or
automatically by sensor for different products requiring different predetermined heating
durations.</p><p num="0083">The apparatus may include the facility for two or more heating compartments so that as one
container is introduced for heating the other is discharged for dispensing. In this arrangement
a common microwave radiation generating unit can be provided which directs microwave
energy at one or other of the compartments.</p><p num="0084">Each container may be colour coded by label or otherwise, each colour representing the
required product temperature. A colour code reader may be provided to detect the colour and
to determine the required product temperature and, hence, the heating duration for that
product.</p><p num="0085">The heating means may be located within or closely adjacent a freezer in which the container 
is stored at said low temperature and there may be provided means for automatically
transferring the container from storage to the heating means.</p><p num="0086">Heating of product may be directed to heat the centre of the product to a higher temperature
than the rest of the product. Sauce and toppings may be injected into the centre of the
product at the filling machine for filling product into the container. Thus on extrusion of
product from the container the centre of the product is warmer and may be liquid. Similarly
toppings on the top of the product may be heated to a higher temperature than the rest of the
product.</p><p num="0087">The apparatus described can be provided with functions which enable the apparatus to be
operated simply as a self-vending operation or otherwise. A display can be provided on the
front part of the equipment in the form of a small visual display unit which may be a liquid
crystal display. The display on the unit may be sourced from a micro- processor which may
be in the form of a RAM chip, by using a CD ROM or a DVD disk. By this means it is
possible to change the display.</p><p num="0088">The display can provide messages to the user relating to the operation of the machine to
indicate to the user the various steps which need to be taken to effect operation, coupling the
display with detectors on the machine which detect at which stage the dispensing operation
has reached. In addition the display may include sales aids such as a welcome sign and
marketing and selling information.</p><p num="0089">Associated with the display may be controls by which information such as nutritional data,
price, recreational information, flavour choice, the weather forecast may be retrieved from
the system. This may be accompanied by audio information including music which may
only be operated when a user approaches the apparatus.</p><p num="0090">The system may be initiated by the user beginning operation of the apparatus and a user will
be provided with instructions for loading and operating the apparatus. If the apparatus
includes scanning means for scanning the container chosen by the user it will be able to 
tailor the information supplied to the product chosen. Furthermore the user may be supplied
with information concerning the stage in the operation ofthe apparatus reached including the
time elapsed and the time which will elapse before the product is ready for consumption.
The user may initiate operation of the system by inserting a coin or a card. If the use of a
card with magnetic strip is employed this could include a special audio message customised
to the product. Advertising may be contained on the card to be displayed. Upon completing
a dispensing operation of the apparatus the display may switch to advertising messages,
advertisements, moving pictures or other material.</p><p num="0091">In the event that the apparatus is not operated properly or completely, such as when an empty
container has not been removed, that customer or the next customer who attempts to operate
the apparatus is given the signal on the display requesting removal of the container. If the
product is not correctly dispensed a signal to this effect may be transmitted to the user and,
in addition, to the attendant. Moreover the system may detect when certain product flavours
are out of stock and this information may also be transmitted to the attendant. The processor
may be connected to a central processor which is capable of transmitting information, upon
request, such as information concerning stocks of product.</p><p num="0092">As another possible facility there may be mounted on the apparatus a camera to observe
customers. If the apparatus is not adapted to self-service use the information displayed can
be mounted differently to be seen by the customer during operation.</p><p num="0093">The display may be connected to the internet so that additional information may be down
loaded and displayed.</p><p num="0094">It may be helpful to have a control whereby the apparatus detects when a service call is
required and sends a request to the nearest service technician. Audio facilities can be
provided from a voice chip so that additional functions can be provided to those previously
described.</p><p num="0095">Referring to Figs 35, 36 and 37 there is shown another container and apparatus for blending 
product within the container in preparation for product to be consumed from the container.</p><p num="0096">The container 210 is of generally circular section over a body portion 211 tapering from a
lower end or base 212 outwards towards the upper end. Towards the upper end the body
portion 211 is stepped outwardly at 213 to provide a shoulder 214. The shoulder 214
provides for stacking the containers 211 inside one another prior to assembly and for
transportation purposes.</p><p num="0097">At the upper end the body 211 is open having an outwardly directed lip 215 arranged to cooperate
with a lid 216, when assembled. The open end of the container 210 may be fitted
with a heat sealed film 218 after assembly and filling with product, over film which the lid
is fitted.</p><p num="0098">Upstanding from the base 212 along the central axis of the container 210 is formed a hollow
upstanding location portion 220 which tapers inwardly towards its upper end and provides
an opening 221 at its lower end. The portion 220 may be offset from the central axis. The
upper end of the portion 220 is open and at the opening is formed a tapered seating 222.</p><p num="0099">A blending element 223 is arranged to sit over the upstanding portion 220 and comprises a
sleeve whose inner surface is shaped to fit rotatably over the outer surface of the hollow
portion 220. The blending element 223 carries at spaced positions along its length outwardly
directed blending blades 224, in this case formed as two vertical rows at opposite sides of the
element 223. The blades 224 are arranged so that upon rotation of the blending element 223
about its axis the blades engage with the product within the container to cause it to be
blended. Other blending elements 223 than that shown may also be used or the blending
element may be omitted in which case the portion 220 is closed at its upper end.</p><p num="0100">At the upper end of the blending element 223 there is formed a driven member 225 arranged
to extend downwardly through the open end of the hollow portion 223 into the seating 222.
At its lower end the driven member 225 is formed with means to engage a drive member 226
(Figs 36 and 37) to be described. </p><p num="0101">The components of the container 210 would normally all be ofplastics material made by any
suitable moulding process, but other materials may be used such as paper based materials.
As seen in Figs 40 and 41 the blending elements 223 are capable of being stacked one on top
of the other by the provision of longitudinally extending slots 227 formed in opposite sides
of the element to receive within the slots the blending blades 224. Similarly, as seen in Fig
41, the lids 216 are arranged for stacking one on top of the other. Although not shown it will
also be evident that the containers 210 are stackable one inside the other with the upper ends
of the hollow portions 220 engaging through the lower openings 221 of adjacent containers
when so stacked. The rim portion 215 of each container engages below the shoulder 214 of
a container located on another container. Such stackability ensures that the component parts
are able to be transported with minimum volume after manufacture and during transportation
to an assembly location.</p><p num="0102">The containers 210 are taken to an assembly and filling location where product is introduced
into the container through the upper end to the predetermined desired level within the
container. Before or after filling the blending element 223 is located over the hollow portion
220. After filling the film 218 is located over the upper opening to seal said upper opening
and the lid 216 is applied over the upper lip 215 of the container. If desired a seal may also
be applied to the lower base 212 of the container to seal the opening 221 and such seal may
be heat sealed and in the form of a film similar to the film 218.</p><p num="0103">Filled and sealed containers may then be cooled or frozen to the desired storage temperature.
In the present case the apparatus described for blending is assumed to be dealing with frozen
product within the containers 210 which needs to be brought up to a blending and dispensing
temperature but the container of Fig 35 may be used in alternative apparatus without a
heating function, for example when the product is aseptically prepared in which case cooling
for transport may not be required.</p><p num="0104">The filled and cooled/frozen containers of product may then be stored and transported to the
point of blending and consumption. Such storage will be at the desired temperature in a
refrigerated environment. </p><p num="0105">Referring now in particular to Figs 36 and 37 there is shown apparatus for blending the
product within the container 210 ready for consumption. The apparatus comprises a housing
230 in which is located a compartment 231 which is a generally cylindrical compartment
open at its upper end and having a releaseable closure member 232 for the upper opening.
At its lower end a drive shaft 233 extends upwardly through the base of the compartment 231
from a drive motor 234. Upstanding from the base of the compartment 231 is a pedestal
member 234 of tapering shape corresponding to the internal dimensions of the hollow portion
220 of the container. At the upper end of the shaft 233, which extends through the pedestal
member 234, there is provided the rotatable drive member 226 arranged to engage the driven
member 225 on the blending means 223. As shown in Fig 36 the container 210 is being
loaded into the compartment 234 so that the blending means 223 is in driving engagement
to be driven by the drive motor 234. The closure member 232 is in the open position having
been pivoted to such position about a pivot 236. The closure member 232 carries a counter
weight 237 to assist in the opening action which may be manually operated or power driven
to automatically open and close.</p><p num="0106">The compartment 231 comprises a microwave compartment whereby microwave energy
from a microwave power source 238 in the housing 230 supplies microwave power to the
compartment 231 in its closed position (Fig 37) to warm up the product within the container
210. Thus after the container 210 has been loaded into the compartment 231 with the drive
means 226 and driven means 225 in driving engagement the closure member 232 is moved
to the closed position. After completion of the loading of the container into the compartment
231 and the closure of the closure member 232 microwave power is directed into the
compartment from the source 238 to heat the product within the container to the desired
temperature. The duration and power of the microwave energy is determined according to
the initial temperature of product within the container, the amount of product within the
container, the nature of product within the container and the desired final temperature of
product within the container. Such duration and power of the microwave energy may be
determined automatically upon reading data on the container and by reading the initial
temperature of the container. Such data may also prevent operation of the apparatus should
the container and its contents not meet the desired parameters, for example if the product has 
passed its sell by date, the container is not filled with product etc.</p><p num="0107">In heating the product within the container by microwave radiation the compartment may be
tailored to the size of the container and the microwave energy may be imparted to the food
product using the internal opening within the container, if necessary. In particular antenna
means may be located within said opening and such means provides the or a source of
microwave radiation.</p><p num="0108">After heating the product in the container the drive means 234 is operated to rotate the
blending means 223 to blend the product which is then ready for consumption from the
container or after being transferred to another container.</p><p num="0109">In the assembly of the blending element 223 with the container the driven member 225 may
be located in the seating 223 as a force fit and a seal is moulded into the seating 222,
preferably in the form of a liquid seal. Thus although the upper end of the other portion 220
may be above the level of product within the container it is preferred that there is a seal
between the portion 220 and the element 223.</p><p num="0110">Referring now to Fig 38, there is shown an alternative form of container which is intended
to simulate a cocktail glass. In this case the container includes a base portion (Fig 41) in the
form of a disc 240 and upstanding from the base is a tapered hollow portion 242 extending
upwards and arranged to be inserted into a body member 243 (Fig 42) in the shape of a
goblet, i.e. of circular cross section and curved inwards towards is lower end. The upper end
of the goblet 243 is open, and during blending the body 243 has located therein a blending
element 244 located over the upper end of the hollow member 242 within the body 243. The
blending element 244 and the drive to said element is similar to that described for the
previous embodiment. Thus the product is filled into the body portion 243 and such product
is blended by rotating the blending element 244 about its axis, as previously described. This
container may have a lid 245 which may be raised and may simulate an umbrella in a manner
of cocktail containers. The body member 243 is located onto the base portion 240 after
blending for consumption of product and the base portion may be of reusable material, for 
example of glass. Alternatively the product is poured out of the body 243 into another
container for consumption.</p><p num="0111">The containers described may be used independently of the microwaveable heating
arrangement, especially if the food product is already at the desired blending temperature.
In other respects the drive arrangement and pedestal support may be as described but it may
no longer be necessary to have the closed compartment around the container.</p><p num="0112">It is intended that the container and the blending element be disposed of after blending and
consumption of the product. Access to the product in the container after blending may be
through the lid 216 and the seal 218 (if present) using a straw. Alternatively the lid 216 may
be removed and access is through the seal 218. However, the lid 216 and seal 218 can both
be removed for consumption of product or the product may be poured into another container,
for example a reusable glass container.</p><p num="0113">Sauces and other additives can be made to the container prior to or during blending, if
required. Such additions will usually be through the lid and seal.</p><p num="0114">The container may be in different sizes according to the product contained or individual
customer requirements. To achieve different sizes the member 220, may remain the same
size with the height and/or diameter of the container being changed. In some cases the base
of the container may be clear of the base of the compartment with the container supported
on the mandrel 234.</p><p num="0115">The inner surface of the member 221 may be polygonal shape with the mandrel 234 of
corresponding section. The length of the drive dog 225 may be varied to maintain
engagement with the drive 226 according to the size of the container.</p><p num="0116">The container 210 may be provided over its internal surface with circumferentially spaced,
radially projecting ribs (not shown) which extend longitudinally of the container from the
lower end towards the upper end. Such ribs assist in agitating the product in the container 
during blending to improve the blending action. The spacing and depth of the ribs may be
selected according to the nature of the product, the form of blending means and the speed of
rotation of such blending means.</p><p num="0117">The product may be frozen carbonated product or beverage in which carbon dioxide is
introduced into the product at or after filling into the container and the product is then frozen
to retain the gas within the product. Product flavours may be added to the product at the
point of sale i.e. during blending and dispensing, as described., The product may alternatively
be aerated at the blending stage.</p><p num="0118">Referring to Figs 43-46 these show further apparatus in which the container of Figs 48-56,
containing food product, is heated and blended. The apparatus comprises a base plate 310
on which is mounted the various components which include a rectangular housing 311
having an upper opening 312 over which is locatable a closure or lid 313. The lid is hinged
about one edge and is lifted and lowered by a handle 314. In the open position of the closure
313 the housing 311 is accessible to insert and remove a container of food product. The
housing 311 and the closure 313 are made from material which reflects microwave radiation
whereby such radiation once entering the housing cannot escape, providing that the closure
313 is in place.</p><p num="0119">Within the housing and directed upwardly from the base thereofis a drive member 316 which
is coupled for rotation about a vertical axis by a motor 317 which drives a belt 318
engageable with a pulley 319 on which the drive member 316 is mounted. Thus operation
of the motor 317 causes the drive member 316 to rotate at a speed selected according to the
blending operation to be conducted on food product within the container.</p><p num="0120">At the upper end of the drive member 316 is located a drive element 321 arranged to
drivingly engage blending means 343 (to be described). Located around the base of the drive
member 316 is a fixed member 323 which provides a support for a tapered support member
324 which supports the container body in a stationary position during blending. </p><p num="0121">Located within the housing 311 between the walls of the housing and the container is a
locating member 325 which is generally of plastics construction and defines an inner
cylindrical portion 326 and an upper diverging portion 327. Containers to be located in the
housing are inserted within the cylindrical portion 326 which is spaced from the sides of the
container. The member 325 is removable for cleaning and sanitisation and may be
disposable.</p><p num="0122">Mounted on the base plate 310 are microwave radiation generating means in the form of
magnetrons 329 of which two are located at one side of the housing 311 and two at the
opposite side, each having associated wave guide means 330 therewith. The wave guide
means 330 are arranged at levels and positions relative to the housing 311 such that
microwave radiation is directed in different directions and levels within the housing so that
the radiation ensures efficient use of the radiated energy directed towards product within the
container. In the arrangement shown the support member 324 will act as a reflector of
radiation so that after the radiation has penetrated through the food product it is reflected
outwards in a different direction and even heating of the product takes place. The
magnetrons are cooled by fans 328. Microwave energy may also be directed into the centre
of the container through an antennae located within the hollow centre, and the antennae may
be located in the support 324. The magnetrons 329 are supplied with power through
transformers 329A.</p><p num="0123">A container for use with the apparatus of Figs 43-46 is illustrated in Figs 47-49. The
container is of generally circular section over a body portion 331 tapering from a lower end
or base 312 outwards towards the upper end. Towards the upper end the body portion 331
is stepped outwardly at 333 to provide a shoulder 334. The shoulder 334 provides for
stacking the containers inside one another prior to assembly and for transportation purposes.</p><p num="0124">In particular, the shoulder enables denesting at a filling station at which product is introduced
into the container.</p><p num="0125">At the upper end the body 331 is open having an outwardly directed lip 335 arranged to 
cooperate with a lid 336, when assembled. The open end of the container may be fitted with
a heat sealed film after assembly and filling with product, over which the lid 336 is fitted.</p><p num="0126">The lid 336 may be omitted or may be applied at the point of sale/dispensing.</p><p num="0127">Upstanding from the base 332 along the central axis of the container is formed a hollow
upstanding portion 340 which tapers inwardly towards its upper end and provides an opening
341 at its lower end. The portion 340 may be offset from the central axis. The upper end of
the portion 340 is open and the opening is formed with a tapered seating 342.</p><p num="0128">A blending element 343 is arranged to sit over the upstanding portion 340 and comprises a
sleeve whose inner surface is shaped to fit rotatably over the outer surface of the hollow
portion 340. The blending element 343 carries at spaced positions along its length outwardly
directed blending blades 344, in this case formed as two vertical rows at opposite sides of the
element 343. The blades 344 are arranged so that upon rotation of the blending element 343
about its axis the blades engage with the product within the container to cause it to be
blended. Blending elements other than that shown may be used.</p><p num="0129">At the upper end of the blending element 343 there is formed a driven member 345 arranged
to extend downwardly through the open end of the hollow portion 343 into the seating 342.
At its lower end the driven member 345 is formed with an opening 346 in which is engaged
the drive element 321. The upper end of the portion 340 and of the blending element 343
may be of lower height than shown and below the level of product in the container.</p><p num="0130">The components of the container are normally of plastics material made by any suitable
moulding process, but other materials may be used, such as paper based materials. Blending
elements 343 are capable of being stacked one on top of the other by the provision of
longitudinally extending slots 347 formed in opposite sides ofthe elements to receive within
the slots the blending,blades 344. Similarly the lids 336 are arranged for stacking one on top
of the other. The containers are also stackable one inside the other with the upper ends of the
hollow portions 340 engaging through the lower openings 341 of adjacent containers when 
so stacked. The upper edge of each container engages below the shoulder 334 of a container
when stacked. Such stackability insures that the component parts are able to be transported
taking up minimum volume after manufacture and during transportation to an assembly
location and can be utilised in filling machines at which the containers need to be denested.</p><p num="0131">The containers are taken to an assembly and filling location where product is introduced into
the containers through their upper ends to reach a predetermined desired level within the
container. Before filling the blending element 343 is located over the hollow portion 340.
After filling the film (if present) is located over the upper opening to seal the opening and the
lid 336 (if used) is applied over the upper edge 335 of the container. If desired a seal may
also be applied to the lower base of the container to seal the opening 341 and such seal may
be heat sealed and in a similar form to the film over the upper end of the container. The
lower seal may be necessary if sterile/UHT/aseptic product is used. Such productmay utilise
the introduction of hot product into the container and may be transported at ambient
temperatures. At a dispensing location the containers may be located in a freezer at the
intended consumption temperature. Such containers may not require any heating function
prior to blending.</p><p num="0132">Filled and sealed containers may be cooled or frozen to the desired storage temperature. In
the present case the apparatus described for blending is assumed to be dealing with frozen
product within the containers, such product needing to be brought up to a blending and
dispensing temperature but the container may also be used in alternative apparatus without
a heating function being required.</p><p num="0133">The filled and cooled/frozen containers of product may be stored and transported to the point
of blending and consumption. Such storage will be at the desired temperature in a
refrigerated environment.</p><p num="0134">When it is required to consume product within the container it is removed from its
refrigerated environment and, when employing the apparatus of Figs 43-46, it is heated and
blended for consumption. The lid 313 is moved to an open position using the handle 314 or 
by power means to reveal the upper opening 312. The container is inserted through the
opening 312 into the housing 311 and the support member 324 is located into the hollow
portion 340 of the container. In this position the drive element 321 is in driving engagement
with the driven member 345 of the element 343.</p><p num="0135">In order to secure the container against movement relative to the support member 324 the
lower end of the hollow portion 340 is shaped at 348 to locate with a correspondingly shaped
part of the support member 324. For example the parts may be of complimentary square,
hexagonal or other shape.</p><p num="0136">Alternatively the outer profile of the container may be shaped for fixed locating in the
housing, or the inner profile shaped for the same reason.</p><p num="0137">After loading into the housing 311 the lid 313 is moved to a closed position across the
opening 312 and heating of product within the container can take place. Microwave radiation
from the magnetrons 329 and wave guide means 330 is directed into the housing 311 for a
predetermined timed duration. The duration and power of the microwave energy is
determined according to the initial temperature of product within the container, the amount
of product within the container, the nature of product within the container, and the desired
final temperature of product within the container. Such duration and power of the microwave
energy may be determined automatically upon reading data on the container and by reading
the initial temperature of the container or by 'testing' the product hardness, as previously
described. Such data may also prevent operation of the apparatus should the container and
its contents not meet the desired parameters, for example if a product has passed its "sell by"
date, the container is not filled with product, or other parameters. Once the desired heating
of product in the container has been attained the drive motor 317 is operated to rotate the
blending element 343 to blend the product. This action makes the product ready for
consumption either from the container, or after it has been transferred to another container.
Access of product directly from the container may be through an opening 350 in the lid of
the container which may be, for example, a frangible opening for a straw. </p><p num="0138">In the assembly of the blending element 343 with the container the driven member 345 may
be located in the seating 342 as a force fit and a seal moulded into the seating 342, preferably
in the form of a liquid seal. Thus although the upper end of the hollow member 340 may be
above the level ofproduct within the container it is preferred that there is a seal between the
member 340 and the element 343.</p><p num="0139">The container described may be used independently of the microwave heating arrangement,
especially if the food product is already at the desired blending temperature. It is intended
that the container and the blending element be disposed of after blending and consumption
of the product. Access to the product in the container after blending may be through the lid
336 and the seal (if present) using a straw. Alternatively the lid 336 may be removed and
access is through the seal. However, the lid and the seal can both be removed for
consumption of product or the product may be poured into another container, for example
a reusable glass container, or a fresh lid may be fitted.</p><p num="0140">Sauces and other additives can be made to the container prior to, during or after blending, if
required. Such additions will usually be through the lid and seal.</p><p num="0141">The container may be in different sizes according to the product contained or individual
customer requirements. To achieve different sizes the drive arrangement may remain the
same size with the height and/or diameter of the container being changed. In some cases the
base of the container may be clear of the base of the housing with the container supported on
the support member 324. The container is provided over its internal surface with ribs 351
which project inwardly into the body of the container and which extends longitudinally from
its lower end towards its upper end. Such ribs 351 assist in agitating and blending product
within the container during ablending operation to improve the blending action. The spacing
and depth of the ribs 351 may be selected according to the nature of the product, the form of
blending means and the speed of rotation of such blending means but the ribs may be
omitted.</p><p num="0142">The product may be frozen carbonated product or beverage in which carbon dioxide is 
introduced into the product at or after filling into the container and the product is then frozen
to retain the gas within the product. Product flavours may be added to the product at the
point of sale i.e. during blending and dispensing, as described. The product may alternatively
be aerated at the blending stage.</p><p num="0143">It will be appreciated that the blending action may have the effect of incorporating air into
the product, the amount of added air being known as "overrun". For example the blending
operation may result in a volume of product which is twice that prior to blending in which
case the container may be only half full at the commencement of blending and becomes full
by incorporating air from the remaining volume of the container into the product during the
blending operation. The intended overrun is predetermined and the product quantity within
the container is selected accordingly. In order to give the desired overrun it may be desirable
to incorporate into the product a foaming agent. However if the product is to be heated to
a relatively high temperature, for hot product, it is unlikely that air will be incorporated into
the product at the filling stage. Carbonated products may be required which replicate product
which is injected with carbon dioxide at the dispensing location. In order to avoid having
to inject such carbon dioxide carbonation may be achieved in other ways. For example a
form of carbonisation may be achieved by locating discretely within the container
components which give rise to the production of carbon dioxide when brought together.
Alternatively the components may be added at the point of dispensing. Such products may
be a citrus acid component and a sodium carbonate component which, when mixed, produce
carbon dioxide.</p><p num="0144">One way in which the carbon dioxide can be produced at the right time is to encapsulate one
or both components within, for example, a fat product which melts at a predetermined
temperature. Upon release of the products the interaction to produce carbon dioxide will take
place. Alternatively the container could be divided by a barrier layer within the container
which inhibits mixing of the components until the blending process takes place. This may
be in the form of a layer of fat or other product which separates the components until the
barrier is broken down. Instead of using encapsulation employing a meltable material the
encapsulating product may be broken down by the action of the blending blades. </p><p num="0145">As a further alternative the components may be introduced into the container before, during
or after the blending process, the components being in liquid or powder form.</p></description><claims lang="EN" status="new"><claim num="xx"><claim-text>A method of blending food product in a container in which:
