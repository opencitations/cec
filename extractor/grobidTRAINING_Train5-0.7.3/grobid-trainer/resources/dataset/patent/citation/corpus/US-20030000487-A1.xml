In it, a cylinder head and a cylinder block received in the engine each have a cooling jacket region, embodied as a cooling pocket; the cooling pockets disposed separately from one another have coolant connections on the inflow and outflow sides for coupling to the cooling loop, so that the cylinder head and the cylinder block of the engine can be supplied separately from one another with coolant, so that thermal regulation of the cylinder head and the cylinder block separately from one another is accordingly possible. An unsatisfactory aspect of this prior art, however, is that because of the integral cooling of all the cylinders, a targeted cooling of individual cylinders of the engine as a function of the operating point cannot be accomplished. </p><heading>ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION </heading><p>[0003] The apparatus of the invention as defined by the characteristics of the body of the main claim has the advantage over the prior art that because of the geometric disposition of the inflow and outflow lines and their flow direction relative to the disposition of the cylinders, each individual cylinder is in direct flow contact with a flow path allocated to it, and thus the number of flow paths is dependent on the number of cylinders, making a targeted, selected cooling of the individual cylinders and combustion chambers as a function of the current engine operating state feasible. An approximately uniform temperature distribution of the individual cylinders can be established in all operating states, with the effect of reducing wear to the corresponding engine components. Because as a result the temperature variance is only slight, the tendency to knocking in full-load operation, for instance, or nitrogen oxide emissions can be reduced. </p><p>[0004] Further advantageous refinements and features of the invention are obtained by the provisions recited in the dependent claims.</p><heading>DRAWING </heading><p>[0005] One exemplary embodiment of the invention is shown and described in the ensuing description and drawing. The drawing, in FIG. 1, shows a side view of an internal combustion engine, embodied in this exemplary embodiment as a 4-cylinder in-line engine, with coolant connections of the apparatus according to the invention for coupling to a cooling loop. FIG. 2 is a sectional view of a cylinder block of the engine with coolant connections, on the inflow and outflow sides, of the apparatus according to the invention in a plan view taken along the section line II-II of FIG. 1. FIG. 3 is a schematic elevation view of the apparatus according to the invention with the associated coolant loop for cooling the engine. </p><heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT </heading><p>[0006] The apparatus for cooling, identified in its entirety in FIG. 1 by reference numeral <b>10</b>, of an internal combustion engine <b>11</b> embodied in this exemplary embodiment as a 4-cylinder in-line engine has one cooling jacket region <b>12</b>′, <b>12</b>″, <b>12</b>′″ each for the cylinder head <b>11</b>′, cylinder block <b>11</b>″ and combustion chamber <b>11</b>′″ of the engine <b>11</b>. The cooling jacket regions <b>12</b>′, <b>12</b>″ are disposed separately from one another and have inflow and outflow lines, associated in pairs with one another and intended for connection to a coolant loop, which in the exemplary embodiment are embodied as coolant connections <b>13</b>, <b>13</b>′, <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>′ and serve the purpose of coupling to the cooling loop on the inflow and outflow sides. To that end, on both the cylinder head <b>11</b>′ and the cylinder block <b>11</b>″, a respective pair of coolant connections <b>13</b>, <b>13</b>′, <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>′ is provided for the respective associated cooling jacket region <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>′; these coolant connections are disposed in the horizontal longitudinal direction or the longitudinal direction of the crankshaft of the engine <b>11</b>, that is, in the direction defined by the in-line arrangement of individual cylinders <b>15</b>, on opposed side walls <b>16</b>, <b>16</b>′ of the engine <b>11</b> in such a way that the respective flow direction of these coolant connections is oriented along the longitudinal direction of the crankshaft. In addition, in a direction also disposed horizontally and extending transversely to the longitudinal direction of the crankshaft, a further group of inflow and outflow lines <b>17</b>-<b>20</b>, <b>17</b>′-<b>20</b>′; <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, <b>21</b>′-<b>24</b>′, in the exemplary embodiment embodied as coolant connections, is provided on both the cylinder block <b>11</b>″ and the cylinder head <b>11</b>′ on opposed side walls <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>′. </p><p>[0007]FIG. 2 illustrates the geometrical disposition of this second group of coolant connections <b>17</b>-<b>20</b> and <b>17</b>′-<b>20</b>′ on the cylinder block <b>11</b>″; each cylinder <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>″, <b>15</b>′″ is assigned two coolant connections <b>17</b>, <b>17</b>′, <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>′, <b>19</b>, <b>19</b>′, <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>′, which are diametrically opposed and mirror-symmetrical to one another with respect to the respective cylinder <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>″, <b>15</b>′″. Thus the individual pairs of coolant connections <b>17</b>-<b>20</b>, <b>17</b>′-<b>20</b>′; <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, <b>21</b>′-<b>24</b>′ are spaced apart from one another in accordance with the spacing of the respective adjacent cylinders along the longitudinal direction of the crankshaft; the coolant connections <b>17</b>-<b>20</b> on the inflow side are disposed on the face-end side wall <b>25</b> of the cylinder block <b>11</b>, and the coolant connections <b>17</b>′-<b>20</b>′ on the outflow side are disposed on the opposite side wall <b>25</b>′, in such a way that their respective flow direction points transversely to the longitudinal direction of the crankshaft and to the respective associated cylinder <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>″, <b>15</b>′″. As a result—unlike the longitudinally oriented coolant connections <b>13</b>, <b>13</b>′, <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>′, as a result of which the serially disposed cylinders <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>″, <b>15</b>′″ receive an oncoming flow in succession—the individual cylinders <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>″, <b>15</b>′″ can experience an oncoming flow directly and simultaneously because of the coolant flows that are parallel in the transverse direction. The cylinder head <b>11</b>′ as well—which for reasons of symmetry is not shown separately—is analogously provided with the same geometrical arrangement of inflow and outflow lines <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>′ embodied as coolant connections, so that on opposed side walls <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>′ of the cylinder head <b>11</b>′, each cylinder <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>″, <b>15</b>′″ is assigned a respective pair of coolant connections <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>′, <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>′, <b>23</b>, <b>23</b>′, <b>24</b>, <b>24</b>′, whose flow direction points transversely to the longitudinal direction of the crankshaft and to the respective associated cylinder <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>″, <b>15</b>′″. This group of inflow and outflow lines <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, <b>21</b>′-<b>24</b>′associated with the cylinder head <b>11</b>′ supplies the cooling jacket region <b>12</b>′″, intended for the combustion chamber <b>11</b>′″ and divided up into cooling pockets, while by comparison the group of inflow and outflow lines <b>17</b>-<b>20</b>, <b>17</b>′<b>20</b>′ associated with the cylinder block <b>11</b>″ opens into the cooling jacket region <b>12</b>″ received in the cylinder block <b>11</b>″. Because in addition the inflow and outflow lines <b>17</b>-<b>20</b>, <b>17</b>′-<b>20</b>′; <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, <b>21</b>′-<b>24</b>′ each have suitable metering bores with flow directions extending transversely to the longitudinal direction of the crankshaft, a thermal cylinder synchronization for each operating point is attainable by means of a delivery of coolant to each cylinder <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>″, <b>15</b>′″ which can be adapted via the metering bores, and by the resultant regulatable longitudinal and transverse flow to the cylinders. </p><p>[0008]FIG. 3 shows the apparatus <b>10</b> according to the invention with the associated cooling loop. On the inflow side, the coolant connections <b>17</b>-<b>20</b> associated with the cylinder block <b>11</b>″ and disposed transversely communicate with a first outlet of a mixing valve <b>27</b>, while the second outlet of this valve communicates on the inflow side with the longitudinally disposed coolant connection <b>14</b>, so that this mixing valve <b>27</b> serves to adjust the mixture ratio between the longitudinally disposed coolant connection <b>14</b> and the transversely disposed coolant connections <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>. Analogously, on the inflow side the coolant connections <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> associated with the cylinder head <b>11</b>′ and disposed transversely communicate with a first outlet of a further mixing valve <b>27</b>′, while its second outlet communicates on the inflow side with the longitudinally disposed coolant connection <b>13</b>, so that this second mixing valve <b>27</b>′ serves to adjust the mixture ratio between the longitudinally disposed coolant connection <b>13</b> and the transversely disposed coolant connections <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>. To adjust the coolant mixture ratio on the inflow side between the cylinder head <b>11</b>′ and the cylinder block <b>11</b>″, the inlet of the first mixing valve <b>27</b> communicates with a first outlet of a third mixing valve <b>28</b>, and the inlet of the second mixing valve <b>27</b>′ communicates with a second outlet of the third mixing valve <b>28</b>. </p><p>[0009] On the outflow side, the transverse coolant connections <b>17</b>′-<b>20</b>′ associated with the cylinder block <b>11</b>″ communicate with a first inlet of a mixing valve <b>29</b>, while its second inlet communicates on the outflow side with the longitudinally disposed coolant connection <b>14</b>′. Analogously, on the outflow side, the transversely disposed coolant connections <b>21</b>′-<b>24</b>′ associated with the cylinder head <b>11</b>″ communicate with a first inlet of a further mixing valve <b>29</b>′, while its second inlet communicates on the outflow side with the longitudinally disposed coolant connection <b>13</b>′. The two mixing valves <b>29</b>, <b>29</b>′ are adjustable separately from one another and serve to return the coolant that has become heated in the engine <b>11</b>; they each have an outlet, and the outlet of the mixing valve <b>29</b> communicates with the outlet of the mixing valve <b>29</b>′; these two outlets communicate with an inlet of a thermostat valve <b>31</b>, which on the outlet side feeds the heated coolant, flowing out of the cylinder head <b>11</b>″ and the cylinder block <b>11</b>′ via the mixing valves <b>29</b>, <b>29</b>′ into a radiator <b>32</b>. The radiator <b>32</b> in turn delivers coolant at a reduced temperature to a feed pump <b>33</b>, which communicates on the outlet side with one inlet of the mixing valve <b>28</b>. Via a branching point <b>34</b>, upstream of the inlet of the thermostat valve <b>31</b>, a portion of the coolant flowing in from the return valves <b>29</b>, <b>29</b>′ is branched off and delivered to a heat exchanger <b>35</b>, whose exit side communicates via a reducing valve <b>36</b> with a branching point <b>37</b> disposed between the radiator <b>32</b> and the feed pump <b>33</b>, so that the coolant whose temperature is reduced in the heat exchanger <b>35</b> is delivered to the feed pump <b>33</b>. A portion of the coolant delivered to the thermostat valve <b>31</b> is carried to the feed pump via a second outlet, coupled to the branching point <b>37</b>, of the thermostat valve <b>31</b>. The branches defined by the radiator <b>32</b> and the heat exchanger <b>35</b>, respectively, of the coolant loop can thus be operated by a single feed pump <b>33</b>. </p><p>[0010] Thus, for instance for the inflow and outflow lines shown in FIG. 2 for the cylinder block <b>11</b>″, the following flow conditions are feasible: In a first version, the split streams delivered to the respective four transversely disposed inflow and outflow lines <b>17</b>-<b>20</b> and <b>17</b>′-<b>20</b>′ of the cylinder block <b>11</b>″ each amount to approximately 25% of the coolant flow delivered to the cylinder block <b>11</b>″, while the split stream in the longitudinally disposed inflow line <b>14</b> of the cylinder block <b>11</b>″ amounts to approximately 0% of the coolant flow delivered to the cylinder block, so that at the corresponding outflow line <b>14</b>′, the corresponding split stream of approximately 0% flows out. In a second version, the split streams delivered to the transversely disposed inflow lines <b>17</b>-<b>20</b> of the cylinder block <b>11</b>″ each amount to approximately 0% of the coolant flow delivered to the cylinder block <b>11</b>″, and at the corresponding outflow lines <b>17</b>′-<b>20</b>′, again approximately 0% is carried away, while the split stream in the longitudinally disposed inflow line <b>14</b> of the cylinder block <b>11</b>″ amounts to approximately 100% of the coolant flow delivered to the cylinder block, so that at the corresponding outflow line <b>14</b>′ the corresponding split stream amounts to 100%. In a third version, the split streams of the coolant flow delivered to the cylinder block <b>11</b>″, specifically to the four transversely disposed inflow lines <b>17</b>-<b>20</b> of the cylinder block <b>11</b>″, each amount to approximately 10%, and at the corresponding outflow lines <b>17</b>′-<b>20</b>′, approximately 25% is carried away from each, while the split stream in the longitudinally disposed inflow line <b>14</b> of the cylinder block <b>11</b>″is adjusted to approximately 60%, so that approximately 0% flows out at the outflow line <b>14</b>′ corresponding to it. In a fourth version, the split streams of the coolant flow delivered to the cylinder block <b>11</b>″, specifically to the four transversely disposed inflow lines <b>17</b>-<b>20</b> of the cylinder block <b>11</b>″, each amount to approximately 0%, and at the corresponding outflow lines <b>17</b>′-<b>20</b>′ approximately 25% is carried away from each, while the split stream in the longitudinally disposed inflow line <b>14</b> of the cylinder block <b>11</b>″ is adjusted to approximately 100%, so that approximately 0% flows away from the outflow line <b>14</b>′ corresponding to it. </p><p>[0011] It is accordingly characteristic for the invention that as coolant connections, a group of paired inflow lines <b>17</b>-<b>24</b> and outflow lines <b>17</b>′-<b>24</b>′, each having flow directions, is provided, and each pair of inflow and outflow lines, because of their respective flow direction, defines a flow path, and each cylinder <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>″, <b>15</b>′″ is assigned a respective flow path flowing to the respective cylinder. The flow directions thereof extend transversely to the longitudinal direction of the crankshaft that is defined by the in-line arrangement of individual cylinders <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>″, <b>15</b>′″. A further group of inflow and outflow lines <b>13</b>, <b>13</b>′; <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>′ is disposed longitudinally to the longitudinal direction of the crankshaft. Because in addition the inflow and outflow lines disposed transversely to it each have metering bores, a thermal cylinder synchronization for each operating point is attainable by means of a delivery of coolant to each cylinder that is adapted by way of these metering bores. </p><p>[0012] In summary, the following advantages are attainable: </p><p>[0013] Because of the capability of establishing an approximately uniform temperature distribution in all operating states, the thermal load on the components belonging to the combustion chamber decreases and thus has the effect of reducing wear. Because of the selective delivery of coolant split streams to the individual combustion chamber regions and the precise cooling that is possible as a result, the volumetric flow required for a uniform temperature distribution drops, thus leading to a reduction in consumption. A drop in the flow resistance because of the embodiment of the coolant split streams parallel to one another in the transverse direction also has the effect of reducing consumption. </p></description><claims load-source="us" status="new" lang="EN"><claim id="US-20030000487-A1-CLM-00001" num="1"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
