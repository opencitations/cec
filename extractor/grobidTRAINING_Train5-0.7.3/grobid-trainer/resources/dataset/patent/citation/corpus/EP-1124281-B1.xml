mobile communication system and, in particular, to a control method of an
adaptive antenna device used in a cellular system which adopts a CDMA
(code division multiple access) method.</p><p num="0002">As well known in the art, radio communication is carried out by
using, as a medium, radio waves that propagate in free space. This
inevitably brings about interference between a desired radio wave to be
received by a desired terminal and the other radio waves to be received by
the other terminals except the desired terminal. Consequently, a
fundamental problem takes place such that quality of communication is
indispensably reduced in both the desired radio wave and the other radio
waves.</p><p num="0003">In order to solve the above-mentioned problem and to effectively
utilize a radio frequency resource, consideration is made about a multiple
access communication method which can not only avoid the interference
but also can carry out communication among a plurality of terminals.
Such a multiple access communication method may be, for example, a
frequency division multiple access (FDMA) method, a time division multiple
access (TDMA) method, and a code division multiple access (CDMA)
method.</p><p num="0004">In either one of the multiple access communication methods,
communication can be ideally carried out among a plurality of terminals
without interference. However, propagation environments are actually 
drastically changed with time and frequency utilization efficiency should be
technically improved in the practical communication in a technical
viewpoint. Such a change of propagation environments and a technical
requirement of improving the frequency utilization efficiency give rise to
incompleteness of practical communication conditions and consequently
brings about any interference.</p><p num="0005">Among the above-mentioned multiple access communication
methods, the CDMA method assigns, to each communication terminal, a
peculiar orthogonal code (or pseudo-noise) which has self-correlation and
low cross correlation and which can be discriminated. With the CDMA
method, all of the communication terminals can use the same frequency in
common by distinguishing each code from one to another.</p><p num="0006">Herein, consideration is made about a mobile communication
system which has movable communication terminals. In this event, each
communication terminal is moved under environments or conditions that
are rapidly and incessantly varied. Under the rapidly and incessantly
varied conditions, the code tends to be vulnerable in orthogonality and to
deteriorate quality of communication due to interference among the codes.
Therefore, when the CDMA method is adopted to the mobile
communication, techniques are inevitably required about transmission
power control for keeping interference uniform or constant and about rake
receiving and path capturing for effectively utilizing a plurality of multi-path
propagation waves having different delay times.</p><p num="0007">On the other hand, recent attention has been focused on an
adaptive antenna that is aimed at improving quality of communication and
frequency utilization efficiency in a mobile communication system of the
CDMA method.</p><p num="0008">Herein, the adaptive antenna is formed such that a plurality of
antenna elements are regularly arranged to form a spatial filter and are 
given reception waves which have amplitudes and phases different from
one another, respectively. In addition, the reception waves are controlled
by giving weights such that amplitudes and phases of the reception waves
become appropriate. Specifically, an antenna gain is adaptively varied
with time in consideration of propagation environments so that the antenna
gain becomes high in a direction of an aimed communication terminal and
becomes low in a direction of an interference wave of a high level.</p><p num="0009">In the mobile communication system of the CDMA method, spatial
separation is realized by adaptively controlling directivity of the adaptive
antenna. With this method, it is possible to reduce displacement of
orthogonality in codes received by the plurality of the communication
terminals which communicate through the same frequency and to
therefore decrease interference between the codes. As a result, the
frequency utilization efficiency can be also improved by this method.</p><p num="0010">In the meanwhile, it should be considered in the mobile
communication system that the propagation environments are rapidly
varied while each communication terminal is moving. In order to trace or
follow such rapid variation of the propagation environments, requirements
are made about capturing accurate propagation information and about
very high speed performance of processing the propagation information.
Recent researches enable high speed simulation. However, it is
practically difficult to implement the processing performance matched with
the high speed simulation. In addition, it is necessary to apply a
directivity control method suitable for each propagation environment.</p><p num="0011">As a directivity control method, both a beam steering control
method and a null steering control method are known in the art and will be
simply often called beam steering control and null steering control below,
respectively. </p><p num="0012">The beam steering control is for generating a plurality of beams
partially overlapped with each other to control the beams so that a main
one of the beams is directed to an aimed communication terminal. With the
beam steering control, it is possible to cover a wide angle by increasing
the beams in number, so as to cope with a variation of a propagation
characteristic. However, the possibility that a superfluous radio wave is
often picked up becomes high with an increase of the beams and the
adaptive antenna becomes low in performance. Although consideration
may be made about using a high speed adaptive algorithm responding to a
rapid variation of a propagation characteristic, such an algorithm can not
be easily implemented, as mentioned before.</p><p num="0013">On the other hand, the null steering control is for generating a wide
beam which has null points directed to directions of receiving interference
waves. At the null points, an antenna gain is drastically attenuated.
However, an antenna gain tends to be lowered in a direction of a desired
wave also in the null steering control.</p><p num="0014">In <ref type="patent">Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei. 11-251986,
namely, 251986/1999</ref>, proposal has been made about an adaptive
antenna device which has a plurality of antenna elements, a first pattern
forming unit for forming a first directivity pattern in a first direction, and a
second pattern forming unit for forming a second directivity pattern in a
second direction orthogonal to the first direction. Herein, it is to be noted
that each of the first and the second forming units is operable in
accordance with the same algorithm. With this structure, when either one
of the first and the second directivity patterns exhibits an excellent
characteristic, the remaining one of the first and the second directivity
patterns exhibits an extremely bad characteristic because no correlation is
present at all between the first and the second directivity patterns. The
adaptive antenna device is disadvantageous in that it can not favorably 
follow a rapid variation of an arrival direction of the desired wave within a
small angle less than 90°.</p><p num="0015">In <ref type="patent">DE 197 37 136 A</ref> an adapted antenna device comprising a plurality of antenna

mobile communication system which adopts beam steering control and
which is specified by an antenna directivity characteristic of a base 
station used in the mobile communication system. In Fig. 1, it is assumed
that the base station is located at a center of a service area illustrated by a
circle. The illustrated service area may be called a cell and is divided into
a plurality of sectors, namely, three sectors designated by 300, 301, and
302 in Fig. 1.</p><p num="0022">In addition, it is surmised that a communication terminal (not
shown) is present in the sector 300 in Fig. 1 and that an obstacle 305 is
placed between the communication terminal and the base station, as
shown in Fig. 1. When the obstacle 305 is not placed, a desired wave
transmitted from the communication terminal is received in a direction
which is depicted by U0 in Fig. 1 and which may be referred to as an
arrival direction of the desired wave. On the other hand, interference
waves I0, I1, I2, and I3 are received from directions depicted by arrow
heads, respectively. The beam steering control is carried out by the base
station to generate a plurality of narrow beams 307, 308, and 309 within
the sector 300 so as to cover the arrival direction U0 of the desired wave
before the obstacle 305 appears between the arrival direction U0 and the
base station. When the obstacle 305 appears as shown in Fig. 1, a path
from the arrival direction U0 is interrupted with the obstacle 305 and
consequently the desired wave is received in Fig. 1 from different
directions depicted by U1 and U2. It is noted that the directions U1 and
U2 are not covered by the narrow beams 307, 308, and 309, as illustrated
in Fig. 1.</p><p num="0023">Generally, when the adaptive antenna device is operated under the
beam steering control, each beam has a narrow beam width (3dB
decreasing point) within an angle of 10° and is azimuthally shifted with
each beam partially overlapped with each other, so as to obtain a diversity
effect. Since only three beams are used in the illustrated system, it is
readily understood that the arrival directions U1 an U2 can not be covered 
with the beams 307, 308, and 309. When the arrival direction U0 of the
desired wave is changed to the different directions U1 and U2, as
illustrated in Fig. 1, the desired wave can not be received because the
directions U1 and U2 can not be covered with the beams due to a variation
of the propagation characteristic.</p><p num="0024">As illustrated in Fig. 1, new beams, such as 306 and 310, may be
added to cope with the variation of the propagation characteristic and to
cover a wide angle range. In this event, a superfluous radio wave may be
received, as mentioned in the preamble of the instant specification.</p><p num="0025">Referring to Fig. 2, description will be made about another
conventional mobile communication system which adopts null steering
control and which is also specified by another antenna directivity
characteristic of the base station used in the mobile communication
system, like in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2, a beam 304 is generated in accordance
with a null steering algorithm. An adaptive antenna device operated
under the null steering control is featured by the beam 304 that has null
points in arrival directions of interference waves. It is apparent from Fig.
2 that the null steering control is carried out such that an antenna gain in
the antenna directivity characteristic is sharply reduced at the null points.</p><p num="0026">In Fig. 2, a desired wave is received from a desired wave direction
U0. On the other hand, interference waves are at first received from
interference wave directions I0, I1, I2, I3, and I4 and are subsequently
received from interference directions l5, l6, and l7. Under the
circumstances, it is assumed that the number of the interference waves
exceeds a degree of freedom determined in dependency upon the number
of antenna elements. In this event, null points can not be formed by the
adaptive antenna device in the interference directions l6 and l7, as is
readily understood from Fig. 2. </p><p num="0027">In addition, the null steering control operation is carried out to form
a null point for the interference wave from l7 adjacent to the desired wave
from U0 and, as a result, the directivity gain for the desired wave from U0
is undesirably reduced as shown in Fig. 2.</p><p num="0028">Thus, the null steering control has a disadvantage that the
directivity gain of the desired wave is undesirably reduced when the
number of the interference waves exceeds the degree of freedom.</p><p num="0029">Alternatively, another adaptive antenna device is also proposed
which generates a main beam tracing a path, together with a backup beam
(supplementary beam) which has a wide directivity. The backup beam
does not need to frequently control or vary a directivity and serves to cover
a range which can not be traced by the main beam. Such a backup beam
may fixedly cover a whole of the sector 300 (Fig. 1) and may be a fixed
beam or a semi-fixed beam. The backup beam is operated only when the
adaptive antenna device can not follow or trace the desired wave.</p><p num="0030">With this adaptive antenna device, the backup beam is used very
often in the mobile communication when system performance is estimated
over a long term. This is because the propagation environments are
always rapidly and drastically varied in the mobile communication. In
consequence, the performance of the adaptive antenna device is
deteriorated in inverse proportion to a frequency of using the backup beam.
For example, when the backup and the main beams are used at a rate of
30% and 70%, respectively, the performance of the adaptive antenna
device is reduced by about 30% in comparison with the performance of the
main beam alone.</p><p num="0031">Furthermore, it is known in the same mobile communication
system that different propagation models are needed in accordance with
environments and that directivity control methods have been considered
which are suitable for the respective models. </p><p num="0032">Taking the above into consideration, proposal has been made
about an adaptive antenna device which carries out statistical calculation
related to the environments, during a receiving operation and which
switches control algorithms from one to another in accordance with a
plurality of propagation models. Specifically, a memory stores the
plurality of the propagation models each of which is selected by a
processor in accordance with the environments. Alternatively, a
hardware structure may be changed in accordance with the environments
from one to another by using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or
the like.</p><p num="0033">As mentioned before, it is difficult with the conventional antenna
devices mentioned above to follow or trace the propagation environments
which are varied every moment. Accordingly, the propagation
environments are averaged in time during a short term and comprehensive
directivity control is usually executed such that an averaged characteristic
is included. With each conventional control method, it is possible to avoid
disorder or diversion of control that might result from temporary variation of
the environments. However, each control method has a shortcoming that
it is difficult to quickly respond to a variation of propagation environments,
such as shadowing, that is rapid and lasts for a while. In addition, the
shadowing means a rapid variation of an environment which occurs when
a communication terminal is moved to a shadow of a building or the like.</p><p num="0034">Moreover, since each of the propagation models is abstractive, it is
very difficult to instantaneously detect a variable point of the abstractive
propagation models. Further, a delay time inevitably occurs until the
variable point is judged, because it is statistically obtained. A physical
delay is also caused to occur so as to switch the algorithms from one to
another. More specifically, the beam steering control has the
disadvantage that it is weak against a rapid variation of the propagation 
environments, such as the shadowing, while the null steering control has
the shortcoming that adaptability is degraded when interference waves
exceed the degree of freedom in the adaptive antenna device.</p><p num="0035">Referring to Fig. 3, description will be made about an adaptive
antenna device according to a first embodiment of this invention. The
adaptive antenna device illustrated in Fig. 3 is structured by a base station
apparatus 1 and an antenna array 2. The adaptive antenna device 1 has
a highway (HWY) interface portion 3, a base station control portion 4, a
baseband modem portion 5, a radio modem 6, and a transmitter/receiver
(T/R) amplifier 7. Although the HWY interface portion 3 and the base
station control portion 4 are separately drawn in Fig. 3, both of them may
be incorporated into a single functional block.</p><p num="0036">Now, the illustrated HWY interface portion 3 serves as a circuit
interface between the base station apparatus 1 and its upper station (base
station controller) (not shown). The base station control portion 4 is
operable to control or monitor a whole of the base station while the
baseband modem 5 serves to carry out coding/decoding and/or
modulating/demodulating (primary modulating/demodulating in a system of
CDMA). The radio modem 6 is operable to up-convert a signal
modulated by the baseband modem 5 into a high frequency band and to
down-convert a high frequency signal given from the T/R amplifier 6 into a
baseband. The T/R amplifier 7 serves to amplify a transmission radio
wave of the high frequency band and a reception radio wave.</p><p num="0037">Referring to Fig. 4, the base station apparatus 1 is illustrated more
in detail. In Fig. 4, similar parts are designated by like reference
numerals and the HWY interface portion 3 and the base station control
portion 4 are collectively designated by a single block in Fig. 4 because
both of them are not directly related to this invention. </p><p num="0038">The base band modem 5 illustrated in Fig. 4 has baseband
modulators 10 to 12, baseband demodulators 25 to 27, a CPU 41, and a
memory 40 used by the CPU 41. Although each number of the baseband
modulators 10 to 12 and the baseband demodulators 25 to 27 is equal to
three, it is practically determined by the number of users accommodated in
the base station.</p><p num="0039">In Fig. 4, the radio modem 6 includes radio modulators 13 to 16
and radio demodulators 28 to 31. It is to be noted that the radio
modulators 13 to 16 are equal in number to antenna elements of the
antenna array 2 for transmission while the radio demodulators 28 to 31 are
equal in number to antenna elements for reception.</p><p num="0040">The T/R amplifier portion 7 is structured by transmission amplifiers
17 to 20 and reception amplifiers 32 to 35 both of which are equal in
number to the antenna elements for the transmission and the reception,
respectively.</p><p num="0041">The illustrated antenna array 2 is structured by the antenna
elements (depicted by 21 to 24) for transmission and the antenna
elements (depicted by 36 to 39) for reception. The antenna elements 21
to 24 for transmission and the antenna elements 36 to 39 are separately
drawn in Fig. 4 but they may be antenna elements which are coupled
through a duplexer and which are common to transmission and reception.</p><p num="0042">From another viewpoint, the illustrated base station apparatus 1
may be divided into a transmitter section 8 and a receiver section 9. In
this event, the transmitter section 8 includes the baseband modulators 10
to 12, the radio modulators 13 to 16, and the transmission amplifiers 17 to
20 while the receiver section 9 includes the baseband demodulators 25 to
27, the radio demodulators 28 to 31, and the reception amplifiers 32 to 35.</p><p num="0043">Referring to Fig. 5 together with Figs. 3 and 4, description will be
made about the baseband modem 5 shown in Figs. 3 and 4 and about the 
baseband modulator and baseband demodulator illustrated in Fig. 4. In
Fig. 5, only a selected one of the baseband modulators (unnumbered) is
shown together with a selected one of the baseband demodulators
(unnumbered) because the remaining baseband modulators and
demodulators are similar in structure to the illustrated baseband modulator
and demodulator, respectively.</p><p num="0044">The baseband modulator is included in the transmitter section 8
and comprises a primary modulator unit 100, a first directivity pattern
generator 101, and a second directivity pattern generator 102. On the
other hand, the baseband demodulator included in the receiver section 9
comprises a third directivity pattern generator 104, a fourth directivity
pattern generator 105, and a primary demodulator 103.</p><p num="0045">As shown in Fig. 5, two of the directivity pattern generators are
coupled to a single primary modulator in the baseband modulator and are
coupled to a single demodulator in the baseband demodulator. From this
fact, it is readily understood that the adaptive antenna device according to
the embodiment of this invention generates directivity patterns or beams in
accordance with two algorithms different from each other for a
communication terminal. This means that, when more than three
algorithms are used in a modification of the illustrated adaptive antenna
device, the directivity pattern generators to be coupled to each of the
primary modulator and the primary demodulator may be equal in number
to the algorithms.</p><p num="0046">Now, description will be made about the structure of the transmitter
section illustrated in Fig. 5. The primary modulator unit 100 is supplied
from the base station control portion or the HWY interface portion with an
input signal and subjects the input signal to coding processing for error
correction and the like and primary modulation processing for CDMA
spreading. An output signal from the primary modulator unit 100 is 
delivered to both the first and the second directivity pattern generators 101
and 102.</p><p num="0047">Both the first and the second directivity pattern generators 101 and
102 are controlled by the CPU 41 cooperating with the memory 40. The
illustrated CPU 41 has first and second CPU units 108 and 109 coupled to
first and second memory units 106 and 107, respectively. In the example
being illustrated, the first and the second CPU units 108 and 109 are
assumed to execute beam steering control and null steering control in
accordance with a beam steering control algorithm and a null steering
control algorithm, respectively.</p><p num="0048">Each of the first and the second directivity pattern generators 101
and 102 is given directivity pattern information according to a designated
algorithm. Specifically, the first directivity pattern generator 101 is
operable in response to the directivity pattern information given from the
CPU unit 109 to carry out the beam steering control and generates the
directivity pattern or beam which is related to the beam steering control.
Likewise, the second directivity pattern generator 102 is operable in
response to the directivity pattern information given from the CPU unit 108
to carry out the null steering control and generates the directivity pattern or
beam which is related to the null steering control.</p><p num="0049">Next, description will be made about the structure of the receiver
section illustrated in Fig. 5. The third and the fourth directivity pattern
generators 104 and 105 are supplied with a reception signal received by
each antenna element. It is to be noted that each antenna element is
coupled to corresponding units of the T/R amplifier 7 and the radio modem
6, as will become clear later.</p><p num="0050">The third and the fourth directivity pattern generators 104 and 105
illustrated in Fig. 5 are coupled to the second and the first CPU units 109
and 108, respectively, and carry out reception processing of the reception 
signal under control of the second and the first CPU units 109 and 108,
respectively. As a result, the third and the fourth directivity pattern
generators 104 and 105 are operable in accordance with different
algorithms determined for the beam and the null steering control,
respectively, to produce processed signals. The processed signals are
supplied to the primary demodulator 103 to be subjected to error correcting
decoding and demodulating processing for CDMA despreading and the
like. It is noted that the processed signals by the different algorithms are
very low in correlation and may be often subjected to diversity combining,
such as weighted combining and selective combining, before decoding.</p><p num="0051">As illustrated in Fig. 5, the CPU 41 is structured by two, namely,
the first and the second CPU units 108 and 109 and by two, namely, the
first and the second memory units 106 and 107 coupled to the first and the
second CPU units 108 and 109, respectively. The first and the second the
memory units 106 and 107 are used as data storage regions for storing the
algorithms determined for the corresponding CPU units 108 and 109 and
data for controlling the directivity pattern. Specifically, the CPU units 108
and 109 and the memory units 106 and 107 correspond to the two
algorithms used in the illustrated baseband modem 5. With this structure,
it is possible to individually and independently control the two algorithms
for single radio communication.</p><p num="0052">Referring to Fig. 6, description will be made about a modification of
the baseband modem 5 illustrated in Fig. 5. The modified baseband
modem 5 is similar in structure to that illustrated in Fig. 5 except that the
CPU 41 and the memory 40 are structured by a single CPU 111 and a single
memory 110, respectively. In the example illustrated in Fig. 6, two kinds of
algorithms run on the single CPU 40. This structure is effective to reduce
an amount of hardware for a control portion to a half. In this connection,
the illustrated CPU 111 processes the two algorithms in a time division 
fashion while the memory 110 is divided into two inside areas which are
selectively used by each algorithm processing. Thus, the single CPU 111
and the single memory 110 are used in common on processing the two
algorithms.</p><p num="0053">Referring to Fig. 7, one of the directivity pattern generator which is
used in the transmitter section 8 illustrated in Fig. 4 is exemplified so as to
describe a function of the directivity pattern generator. In the receiver
section 9, each directivity pattern generator is similar in structure except
that each arrow head in Fig. 7 is directed in a reverse direction.
Therefore, description will be omitted about each directivity pattern
generator included in the receiver section 9.</p><p num="0054">Now, the directivity pattern generator illustrated in Fig. 7 comprises
a plurality of phase shifters 200 to 202 connected in parallel to one another
and a plurality of variable attenuators 203 to 205 connected in cascade to
the respective phase shifters 200 to 202, respectively. Combinations of
the phase shifters 200 to 202 and the variable attenuators 203 to 205 are
supplied to a single input signal from the primary modulator and are equal
in number to the antenna elements. The phase shifters 200 to 202 and
the variable attenuators 203 to 205 are connected to the CPU 41 and
serve to vary phase components and amplitude components of the input
signal in response to the control signals delivered from the CPU 41. As a
result, it is possible to control a directivity characteristic of a whole of the
antenna array.</p><p num="0055">Subsequently, description will be made about a control principle of
the directivity pattern by taking the receiver section as an example. The
antenna elements in the antenna array 2 are regularly spaced apart from
one another. Therefore, distances between the respective antenna
elements and a communication terminal are accurately different from one
another. This means that, when an identical signal is transmitted from an 
antenna of the communication terminal and is received by the base station
as received signals at the respective antenna elements, the received
signals at the respective antenna elements have different phases and
amplitudes.</p><p num="0056">For example, let a signal transmitted from the antenna of the
communication terminal be received by two of the antenna elements in the
base station as two received signals. It is assumed that the two received
signals are given to the two directivity pattern generators through the
receiver amplifier and the radio demodulator (Fig. 3). When the two
received signals have the same amplitude and phases different from each
other by 180°, both the received signals are cancelled by each other and
the resultant base station is put in a state which is similar to the state of
receiving no signal.</p><p num="0057">To the contrary, when the two received signals have the same
phases and the same amplitudes, the base station is put in a state which is
similar to the state of receiving a received signal of twice the amplitude.
In this event, the base station receives the received signal having twice the
amplitude and four times electric power.</p><p num="0058">Taking the above into consideration, the directivity pattern
generators of the baseband demodulator in the base station are controlled
so that all signals become the same phases and amplitudes as one
another when the signals received by the antenna elements are given to
the primary demodulator through the receiver amplifier, the radio
demodulator, and the directivity pattern generators. With this structure, it
is possible to reproduce a signal which has electric power exponentially
proportional to the antenna elements of the base station when reception
processing is carried out in the base station.</p><p num="0059">Furthermore, when the base station receives a signal transmitted
from a desired communication terminal, the directivity pattern generators in 
the baseband demodulator of the base station are controlled so as to
cancel any interference or jamming waves transmitted from any other
communication terminals. This makes it possible to reproduce the
desired signal by the receiving processing in the base station under good
conditions following less interference waves.</p><p num="0060">Although the above-principal for controlling the directivity has been
made as an example about the receiving processing in the base station,
this applies to transmitting processing in the base stations.</p><p num="0061">Turning back to Fig. 7, the illustrated directivity pattern generator is
illustrated in the form of a functional block and may be realized by a digital
signal processor which can control phase and amplitude components
subjected to digital signal processing and which may be substantially
equivalent to the phase shifters and the attenuators.</p><p num="0062">Thus, it is possible to establish the adaptive antenna device
according to this invention by including the CPU 41, the memory 40, and
the directivity pattern generators each of which corresponds to a plurality
of algorithms.</p><p num="0063">Referring to Fig. 8, description will be conceptually made about an
antenna directivity pattern in the base station according to this invention.
In Fig. 8, the antenna directivity pattern generated by the base station is
diagrammatically shown in relation to arrival directions of a desired wave
and interference waves. Herein, it is surmised that a communication
terminal is moved within a service area (a cell) of the base station,
communicating with the base station.</p><p num="0064">As mentioned before, the illustrated cell is divided into a plurality of
sectors which are equal in number to three in Fig. 8. However, it is to be
noted that this invention is not restricted to three sectors but may be
applied to a system which has an optional number of the sectors. </p><p num="0065">In Fig. 8, the three sectors are designated by 300, 301, and 302
and the communication terminal is present within the sector 300.
Furthermore, the arrival direction of the desired wave is depicted by U0
while the arrival directions of the interference waves are depicted by I0, I1,
I2, I3, and I4 in Fig. 8.</p><p num="0066">The illustrated beam 303 shows a narrow beam which is generated
in accordance with the algorithm for the beam steering control and which
has a main lobe having a half-width narrower than 10°. On the other
hand, the beam 304 shows a beam which is generated in accordance with
the algorithm for the null steering control. Herein, it is assumed that each
control is put into a converged state, namely, a stable state. Such a
stable state is not varied in each beam.</p><p num="0067">Each of the beams 303 and 304 is changed in a manner illustrated
in Figs. 9 through 11 in response to variations of the desired wave and the
interference waves, as will be mentioned later in detail. To this end, the
adaptive antenna device according to this invention executes an operation
illustrated in Fig. 12.</p><p num="0068">Referring to Fig. 12, description will be made about a basic control
operation of the base station according to this invention. As shown in Fig.
12, the control operation is separated into three partial flows each of which
may be carried out simultaneously or in a time division fashion made
alternately at a very short time interval.</p><p num="0069">Among the three partial flow, one of the partial flows is for beam
steering processing while another one is for null steering processing. The
remaining partial flow is for estimating an arrival direction of each wave.
In both the beam steering processing and the null steering processing, the
two partial flows begin at initialization steps (steps a1 and a2) of initializing
parameters used for each control operation. Thereafter, directivity control
is carried out to generate beams in accordance with the control algorithms 
for the beam steering control and the null steering control (steps a3 and
a4). The steps a3 and a4 are followed by a step a5 at which received
waves are weighted and combined in accordance with evaluation functions
determined in relation to reception strength and/or reception quality.
Subsequently, each control operation is repeated in a similar manner by
returning back to the beam steering control and the null steering control
shown in the steps a3 and a4.</p><p num="0070">On the other hand, the arrival direction estimation flow is for
estimating an arrival direction of a desired wave in response to amplitudes
and phases of received waves that are received through different antenna
elements (step a6). The results of the estimation are delivered to each
control processing and used as an angle profile of parameter information
in the beam steering control and the null steering control. A sequence of
processing illustrated in Fig. 12 is finished when three antenna directivity
control operations are converged and become stable.</p><p num="0071">Referring to Fig. 13, the step a3 (illustrated in Fig. 12) for carrying
out the beam steering control will be described in detail. Herein, it is to be
noted that various kinds of the algorithms have been strictly proposed so
as to carry out the beam steering control but a common operation in all of
the algorithms alone will be mentioned in conjunction with Fig. 13, with
small differences omitted from the description.</p><p num="0072">In Fig. 13, the beam steering control is started at a step b1 of
providing a beam width, an angle profile for determining a beam direction,
and previous control information which is used in the past when the control
is continuously carried out in the past. The angle profile is determined by
information obtained by estimating the arrival direction at the step a6 (Fig.
12). No previous control information is used when control operation is
initially started or when control operation is restarted after the parameters
are initialized. The step b1 is succeeded to a step b2 at which a desired 
beam is generated.</p><p num="0073">Referring to Fig. 14, the step a4 (illustrated in Fig. 12) for carrying
out the null steering control will be described hereinafter. As shown in Fig.
14, the step a4 begins at a step c1 of providing an angle profile for
determining a beam direction and previous control information which is
used in the past when the null steering control is continuously carried out
from the past The previous control Information may include previous
antenna parameters and previous angle profile.</p><p num="0074">The step c1 is followed by a step c2 of generating a beam. Herein,
it is noted that no parameter related to a beam width is used in the null
steering control different from the beam steering control. The remaining
parameters in the null steering control are similar to those in the beam
steering control.</p><p num="0075">Each step illustrated in Figs. 12 to 14 may be implemented either
by a hardware circuit unit or by a software program.</p><p num="0076">Referring back to Figs. 8 through 11, description will be made
about a variation of the directivity pattern which is converged on the basis
of directivity pattern control, as mentioned above. In Figs. 8 through 11, it
is assumed that the base station is located at each center of the circles
(cells). As illustrated in Fig. 8, the desired wave is received from the
arrival direction U0 which is covered with both the beams 303 and 304.
Among them, the beam 303 is controlled by the beam steering control so
that a maximum gain portion of the beam 303 is directed to the arrival
direction U0 of the desired wave.</p><p num="0077">On the other hand, the beam 304 is shaped by the null steering
control so that null points appear in the arrival directions l0, l1, l2, l3, and
I4 of the interference waves. Simultaneously, the beam 304 is controlled
to obtain a maximum quality of the desired wave by forming a lobe which
has a high gain in the arrival direction U0 of the desired wave. </p><p num="0078">Referring to Fig. 9, description will be made about the case where
a rapid variation is caused to occur in a propagation characteristic between
the communication terminal and the base station. In Fig. 9, it is assumed
that an obstacle 305 appears between the communication terminal and the
base station while the communication terminal is being moved. As shown
in Fig. 9, the obstacle 305 intercepts the arrival direction U0 of the desired
wave and the resultant desired wave is received from two arrival directions
U1 and U2.</p><p num="0079">Suppose the beam width in the beam steering control can not be
followed because the propagation characteristic is rapidly varied between
the communication terminal and the base station. In other words, the
beam width is kept at the converged state illustrated in Fig. 8 at this time
instant. Under the circumstances, the desired wave can not be received
by the beam 303 any longer. But, the desired wave can be received by
using the beam 304 by capturing the desired wave from the arrival
directions U1 and U2. At the illustrated time instant, the beam 304 is not
controlled at an optimum state in relation to the arrival directions U1 and
U2 of the desired wave. However, it is possible to avoid a fatal damage
such that communication is interrupted, when the receiving operation is
carried out by the base station.</p><p num="0080">This is apparent from the fact that a group of paths which arrives
from the communication terminal to the base station generally falls within
an angle range of several tens of degrees, although the angle range
depends on frequencies and a radius of each cell, and that a main lobe
becomes wide in the null steering control. This is because directivity
control based on the null steering control is mainly aimed to form a sharp
null.</p><p num="0081">Referring to Fig. 10, illustration is made of a state wherein the
beam 304 is controlled so that the desired wave can be received from the 
arrival directions U1 and U2 when a predetermined time lapses after the
state of Fig. 9. As illustrated in Fig. 10, the main lobe of the beam 304 is
expanded so as to receive the desired wave from the arrival directions U1
and U2. Consequently, the base station can continue the receiving
operation by using the beam 304 for the time being.</p><p num="0082">Referring to Fig. 11, the obstacle 305 is removed from the state of
Fig. 10 within a very short time. In this event, the desired wave from the
arrival direction U0 can be captured by the beam 303 again. It is needless
to say that the beam 304 can also capture the desired wave from the
arrival direction U0, although an optimum state is not kept about the beam
304.</p><p num="0083">Thus, the adaptive antenna device according to this invention can
realize the operation by executing the beam steering processing, the null
steering processing, and the estimating processing of the arrival direction
in parallel, by reflecting the results of the estimating processing on the
beam steering processing and the null steering processing, and by
weighting and combining the processing results of the beam steering
processing and the null steering processing.</p><p num="0084">Referring to Fig. 15, description is made about an operation of an
adaptive antenna device according to a second embodiment of this
invention. The operation of the illustrated adaptive antenna device
comprises steps which are similar to those illustrated in Fig. 12 and which
are depicted by similar reference symbols or numerals. Specifically, the
operation illustrated in Fig. 15 is different from that illustrated in Fig. 12 in
that steps d1 and d2 are executed prior to the weighting and combining
step a5 to determine whether or not the steps d1 and d3 are moved to
steps d3 and d4, respectively.</p><p num="0085">In Fig. 15, control operation is separated at its beginning into three
kinds of flows each of which is executed simultaneously or in a time 
division fashion alternately carried out at a very short time interval. One
of the three kinds of the flows specifies beam steering control while
another specifies null steering control. The remaining flow specifies
processing for estimating an arrival direction. Like in Fig. 12, the
parameters are initialized at the steps a1 and a2 in the beam and the null
steering processing and are followed by the beam steering control and the
null steering control steps a3 and a4, respectively. As a result, the
directivity control operations are carried out at the steps a3 and a4 in
accordance with the respective algorithms to generate the beams.</p><p num="0086">At the steps d1 and d2, signals received by the use of the directivity
controlled beams are compared with threshold levels to detect whether or
not the received signals exceed the threshold levels, respectively. If the
received signals exceed the threshold levels, the steps d1 and d2 are
followed by the weighting and combining step a5 which has been already
mentioned before. Otherwise, the steps d1 and d2 are succeeded by the
steps d3 and d4 at which operation is carried out in sleep modes in a
manner to be described later, respectively. When each of the sleep mode
is finished at each of the steps d3 and d4, operation is returned back to the
step d1 or d2 and similar operation is repeated.</p><p num="0087">Referring to Fig. 16, the sleep mode is started at IN and is
transmitted from one control side to another control side (step e1 or e2).
Specifically, such sleep mode information is transmitted from the beam
steering control side to the null steering control side or vice versa. After
the sleep mode information is transmitted to another steering control, a
waiting state is kept at a step e3.</p><p num="0088">When the sleep mode information is received during the waiting
state, as shown at the step e3 in Fig. 16, the step e3 is quickly followed by
a step e4, although no control operation is substantially carried out during
the waiting state. This shows that, when a predetermined delay time 
lapses or the sleep mode information is received from another control, the
waiting state is released and is succeeded by a step e4 of initializing
parameters. Each control operation is restarted in accordance with each
algorithm at a step e5 and, thereafter, the sleep mode of operation is
finished.</p><p num="0089">With this structure, the adaptive antenna device according to the
second embodiment of this invention can accomplish an operation by
executing the beam steering processing, the null steering processing, and
the estimating processing of the arrival direction in parallel and by
reflecting the results of the estimating processing on the beam steering
processing and the null steering processing. Thereafter, comparison is
made between the processing results of the beam steering processing and
the null steering processing and the predetermined threshold levels and
the weighting and combining processing is executed when the processing
results exceed the threshold levels. Otherwise, the weighting and
combining processing is executed after the waiting state lasts for the
predetermined time interval until the processing results exceed the
threshold levels.</p><p num="0090">As mentioned before, this invention uses both a narrow beam
generated by the beam steering control and a comparatively wide beam
generated by the null steering control and receives signals by weighting
and combining operation. Inasmuch as a kind of a backup beam is
always formed, it is possible to provide a stable quality of service in the
mobile communication system without any fatal damage, such as
communication interruption, even when the propagation characteristic is
rapidly varied.</p><p num="0091">By using the narrow beam according to the beam steering control
and the wide beam according to the null steering control in common,
received waves are obtained from independent beams based on the 
different control. Thus obtained received waves are low in path
correlation and serve to determine optimum paths based on the respective
control. As a result, a very high diversity gain can be accomplished in the
above-mentioned manner.</p><p num="0092">Furthermore, the adaptive antenna device according to this
invention is not lowered in its performance, in spite of the fact that
receiving operation is executed by slmultaneously using a plurality of
beams. This is because use is made about both the beam steering control
and the null steering control which are highly independent of each other
and which are different in property from each other and optimum solutions
can be combined in the respective control.</p><p num="0093">Moreover, when either one of the beam steering control and the
null steering control does not contribute to a receiving operation, delay
processing due to the sleep mode is executed for a predetermined time
which serves to provide a hysteresis. With this structure, it is possible to
avoid divergence of the control in the adaptive antenna device because
response does not become excessively keen to an instantaneous variation
of the propagation characteristic.</p><p num="0094">While this invention has thus far been described in conjunction with
a few embodiments thereof, it will be readily possible for those skilled in
the art to put this invention into practice in various other manners. For
example, although the beam steering control and the null steering control
have been executed in the above-mentioned embodiments, this invention
may not be always restricted to the above-exemplified control but may be
applied to an adaptive antenna device which is operable in accordance
with a plurality of algorithms different from each other.</p></description><claims lang="DE" status="new"><claim num="xx"><claim-text>Adaptive Antennenvorrichtung mit einer Anzahl von Antennenanordnungen (2) und
