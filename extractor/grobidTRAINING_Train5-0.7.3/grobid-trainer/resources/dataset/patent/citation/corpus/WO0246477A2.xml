All documents cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p>TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to the diagnosis of cancer, particularly prostate cancer. In particular, it relates to a subgroup of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) which show up-regulated expression in tumors, particularly prostate tumors.</p><p>BACKGROUND ART
Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men in the USA. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the abnormal growth of benign prostate cells in which the prostate grows and pushes against the urethra and bladder, blocking the normal flow of urine. More than half of the men in the USA between the ages of 60 and 70 and as many as 90 percent between the ages of 70 and 90 have symptoms of BPH. Although this condition is seldom a threat to life, it may require treatment to relieve symptoms.</p><p> Cancer that begins in the prostate is called primary prostate cancer (or prostatic cancer).</p><p>Prostate cancer may remain in the prostate gland, or it may spread to nearby lymph nodes and may also spread to the bones, bladder, rectum, and other organs. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by measuring the levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) in the blood. The level of PSA in blood may rise in men who have prostate cancer, BPH, or an infection in the prostate. The level of PAP rises above normal in many prostate cancer patients, especially if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. However, one cannot diagnose prostate cancer with these tests alone because elevated PSA or PAP levels may also indicate other, non-cancerous problems.</p><p> In order to help determine whether conditions of the prostate are benign or malignant further tests such as transrectal ultrasonography, intravenous pyelogram, and cystoscopy are usually performed. If these test results suggest that cancer may be present, the patient must undergo a biopsy as the only sure way to diagnose prostate cancer. Consequently, it is desirable to provide a simple and direct test for the early detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer without having to undergo multiple rounds of cumbersome testing procedures. It is also desirable and necessary to provide compositions and methods for the prevention and/or treatment of prostate cancer. </p><p> It is an object of the invention to provide materials that can be used in the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of prostate cancer. It is a further object to provide improvements in the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of prostate cancer.</p><p>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION
It has been found that human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) of the HML-2 subgroup of the HERV-K family show up-regulated expression in prostate tumors. This finding can be used in prostate cancer screening, diagnosis and therapy.</p><p> The invention provides a method for diagnosing cancer, especially prostate cancer, the method comprising the step of detecting the presence or absence of an expression product of a HML-2 endogenous retrovirus in a patient sample. Higher levels of expression product relative to normal tissue indicate that the patient from whom the sample was taken has cancer.</p><p> The HML-2 expression product which is detected is either a mRNA transcript or a polypeptide translated from such a transcript. These expression products may be detected directly or indirectly. A direct test uses an assay which detects HML-2 RNA or polypeptide in a patient sample. An indirect test uses an assay which detects biomolecules which are not directly expressed in vivo from HML-2 e. g. an assay to detect cDNA which has been reverse-transcribed from a HML-2 mRNA, or an assay to detect an antibody which has been raised in response to a
HML-2 polypeptide.</p><p> A-THE PATIENT SAMPLE
Where the diagnostic method of the invention is based on HML-2 mRNA, the patient sample will generally comprise cells, preferably, prostate cells. These may be present in a sample of tissue, preferably, prostate tissue, or may be cells, preferably, prostate cells which have escaped into circulation (e. g. during metastasis). Instead of or as well as comprising prostate cells, the sample may comprise virions which contain mRNA from HML-2.</p><p> Where the diagnostic method of the invention is based on HML-2 polypeptides, the patient sample may comprise cells, preferably, prostate cells and/or virions (as described above for mRNA), or may comprise antibodies which recognize HML-2 polypeptides. Such antibodies will typically be present in circulation.</p><p> In general, therefore, the patient sample is tissue sample (e. g. a biopsy), preferably, a prostate sample (e. g. a biopsy) or a blood sample. </p><p> The patient is generally a human, preferably human male, and more preferably an adult human male.</p><p> Expression products may be detected in the patient sample itself, or it may be detected in material derived from the sample (e. g. the supernatant of a cell lysate, or a RNA extract, or cDNA generated from a RNA extract, or polypeptides translated from a RNA extract, or cells derived from culture of cells extracted from a patient etc.). These are still considered to be "patient samples"within the meaning of the invention.</p><p> Methods of the invention can be conducted in vitro or in vivo.</p><p> Other possible sources of patient samples include isolated cells, whole tissues, or bodily fluids (e. g. blood, plasma, serum, urine, pleural effusions, cerebro-spinal fluid, etc.) B-THE MANA EXPRESSION PRODUCT
Where the diagnostic method of the invention is based on mRNA detection, it typically involves detecting a RNA comprising six basic regions. From 5'to 3', these are:
1. A sequence which has at least 75% identity to SEQ ID 155 (e. g. 76%, 77%, 78%,
79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%,
95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity); or a sequence which has at least

100,110,115,120,125,130,135,140,145, etc., contiguous nucleotides) of SEQ ID 155; or a sequence which has at least 80% identity (e. g. 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%,
88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity) to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment (e. g. 25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,
65,70,75,80,85,90,95,100,110,115,120,125,130,135,140,145, etc., contiguous nucleotides) of SEQ ID 155 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold (e. g. 2,2.5,5,10,20,50, etc., fold) higher level relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level. This sequence will typically be at the 5'end of the RNA. SEQ ID 155 is the nucleotide sequence of the start of R region in the LTR of the'ERVK6'HML-2 virus [ref. 1]. This portion of the R region is found in all full-length HML-2 transcripts.</p><p> 2. A downstream region comprising a sequence which has at least 75% sequence identity to SEQ ID 156 (e. g. 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity); or a sequence which has at least 50% identity to SEQ ID 156 (e. g. 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity) and is expressed at least 1.5 fold (e. g. 2,2.5,5,10,20,50, etc., fold) higher level relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level; or a sequence which has at least 80% identity (e. g. 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity) to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment (e. g. 25, 30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,95,100,110,115,120,125,130,135,140, 145,150,155,160,165,170,175,180,185,190,195,200,205,210,215,220,225,230, 235,240,245,250,255, etc., contiguous nucleotides) of SEQ ID 156; or a sequence which has at least 80% identity (e. g. 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity) to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment (e. g. 25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,95, 100,110,115,120,125,130,135,140,145,150,155,160,165,170,175,180,185,190, 195,200,205,210,215,220,225,230,235,240,245,250,255, etc., contiguous nucleotides) of SEQ ID 156 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold (e. g. 2,2.5,5,10,20,50, etc., fold) higher level relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level. SEQ ID 156 is the nucleotide sequence of the RUs region downstream of
SEQ ID 155 in the ERVK6 LTR. This region is found in full-length HML-2 transcripts, but may not be present in all mRNAs transcribed from a HML-2 LTR promoter.</p><p> 3. A downstream region comprising a sequence which has at least 75% sequence identity to SEQ ID 6 (e. g. 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity); or a sequence which has at least 50% identity to SEQ ID 6 (e. g. 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity) and is expressed at least 1.5 fold (e. g. 2,2.5,5,10,20,50, etc., fold) higher level relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level; or a sequence which has at least 80% identity (e. g. 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity) to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment (e. g. 25, 30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,95,100, etc., contiguous nucleotides) of
SEQ ID 6; or a sequence which has at least 80% identity (e. g. 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity) to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment (e. g. 25,30,35,40, 45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,95,100, etc., contiguous nucleotides) of SEQ ID 6 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold (e. g. 2,2.5,5,10,20,50, etc., fold) higher level relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level. SEQ
ID 6 is the nucleotide sequence of the region of the ERVK6 virus between the U5 region and the first 5'splice site. This region is found in full-length HML-2 transcripts, but has been lost by some variants and, like region 2 above, may not be present in all mRNAs transcribed from a HML-2 LTR promoter.</p><p> 4. A downstream region comprising any RNA sequence. This region will typically comprise the coding sequence of one or more HML-2 polypeptides, but may alternatively comprise: a mutant viral coding sequence; a viral or non-viral non-coding sequence; or a non-viral coding sequence. Transcription of any of these sequences can come under the control of a HML-2 LTR.</p><p> 5. A downstream region comprising a sequence which has at least 75% sequence identity to SEQ ID 5 (e. g. 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity); or a sequence which has at least 50% identity to SEQ ID 5 (e. g. 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity) and is expressed at least 1.5 fold (e. g. 2,2.5,5,10,20,50, etc., fold) higher level relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level; or a sequence which has at least 80% identity (e. g. 81%, 82%, 
83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%,
99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity) to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment (e. g. 25,
30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,95,100,110,115,120,125,130,135,140,
145,150,155,160,165,170,175,180,185,190,195,200,205,210,215,220,225,230,
235,240,245,250,255,260,265,270,275,280,285,290,295,300,350,400,450,500,
550,600,650,700,750,800, etc., contiguous nucleotides) of SEQ ID 5 ; or a sequence which has at least 80% identity (e. g. 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%,
92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 100% identity) to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment (e. g.. 25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,
95,100,110,115,120,125,130,135,140,145,150,155,160,165,170,175,180,185,190,
195,200,205,210,215,220,225,230,235,240,245,250,255,260,265,270,275,280,
285,290,295,300,350,400,450,500,550,600,650,700,750,800, etc., contiguous nucleotides) of SEQ ID 5 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold (e. g. 2,2.5,5,10,20,50, etc., fold) higher level relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a
95% confidence level. SEQ ID 5 is the nucleotide sequence of the U3R region in the 3'end of ERVK6. This sequence will typically be near the 3'end of the RNA, immediately preceding any polyA tail.</p><p> 6. A 3'polyA tail. </p><p> The percent identity of the sequences described above are determined by the Smith
Waterman algorithm using the default parameters: open gap penalty =-20 and extension penalty =-5. </p><p> These mRNA molecules are referred to below as"PCA-mRNA"molecules ("prostate cancer associated mRNA"), and endogenous viruses which express these PCA-mRNAs are referred to as PCAVs ("prostate cancer associated viruses"). Nevertheless, said PCAVs may also be associated with other types of cancer.</p><p> Although some PCA-mRNAs include all six of these regions, most HERVs are defective in that they have accumulated multiple stop codons, frameshifts, or larger deletions etc. This means that many PCA-mRNAs do not include all six regions. As all PCA-mRNAs are transcribed under the control of the same group of LTRs, however, transcription of all
PCA-mRNAs is up-regulated in prostate tumors even though the mRNA may not encode functional polypeptides. </p><p> Where a mRNA to be detected is driven by 5'LTR of HML-2 in genomic DNA, the first of these regions will always be present, but the remaining five are optional. Conversely, where a mRNA to be detected is controlled by 3'LTR of HML-2, the fifth of these regions will always be present, but the remaining five are optional.</p><p> In general, therefore, the mRNA to be detected has the formula Nl-N2-N3-N4-N5- polyA, wherein: - Nl has at least 75% sequence identity to SEQ ID 155; or has at least 50% identity to SEQ ID 155 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold higher relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level; or has at least 80% identity to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment of SEQ ID 155 ; or has at least
80% identity to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment of SEQ ID 155 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold higher relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level; - N2 has at least 75% sequence identity to SEQ ID 156; or has at least 50% identity to SEQ ID 156 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold higher relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level; or has at least 80% identity to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment of SEQ ID 156; or has at least
80% identity to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment of SEQ ID 156 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold higher relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level; - N3 has at least 75% sequence identity to SEQ ID 6; or has at least 50% identity to SEQ ID 6 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold higher relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level; or has at least 80% identity to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment of SEQ ID 6; or has at least 80% identity to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment of SEQ ID 6 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold higher relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level; - N4 comprises any RNA sequence; - N5 has at least 75% sequence identity to SEQ ID 5; or has at least 50% identity to SEQ ID 5 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold higher relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level; or has at least 80% identity to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment of SEQ ID 5; or has at least 80% identity to at least a 20 contiguous nucleotide fragment of SEQ ID 5 and is expressed at least 1.5 fold higher relative to expression in a normal (i. e., non cancerous) cell with at least a 95% confidence level; and - at least one of Ni, N2, N3, N4 or N5 is present, but polyA is optional.</p><p> Although only at least one of Nl, N2, N3, N4 or N5 needs to be present, it is preferred that two, three, four or five of these regions are present. It is preferred that at least one of N1 and/or 
N5 is present.</p><p> Nl is preferably present in the mRNA to be detected (i. e. the invention is preferably based on the detection of mRNA driven by a 5'LTR). More preferably, at least Nl-N2 is present.</p><p> Where Nl is present, it is preferably at the 5'end of the mRNA (i. e. 5'-Nl-...). </p><p> Where N5 is present, it is preferably immediately before a 3'polyA tail (i. e....-N5polyA-3').</p><p> Where N4 is present, it preferably comprises a polypeptide-coding sequence (e. g. encoding a HML-2 polypeptide). Examples of HML-2 polypeptide-coding sequences are described below.</p><p> The RNA will generally have a 5'cap.</p><p> B. 1-Enriching RNA in a sample
Where diagnosis is based on mRNA detection, the method of the invention preferably comprises an initial step of : (a) extracting RNA (e. g. mRNA) from a patient sample; (b) removing DNA from a patient sample without removing mRNA ; and/or (c) removing or disrupting DNA which comprises SEQ ID 4, but not RNA which comprises SEQ ID 4, from a patient sample. This is necessary because the genomes of both normal and cancerous prostate cells contain multiple PCAV DNA templates, whereas increased PCA-mRNA levels are only found in cancerous cells. As an alternative, a RNA-specific assay can be used which is not affected by the presence of homologous DNA.</p><p> Methods for extracting RNA from biological samples are well known [e. g. refs. 2 &amp; 8] and include methods based on guanidinium buffers, lithium chloride, SDS/potassium acetate etc.</p><p>After total cellular RNA has been extracted, mRNA may be enriched e. g. using oligo-dT techniques.</p><p> Methods for removing DNA from biological samples without removing mRNA are well known [e. g. appendix C of ref. 2] and include DNase digestion. </p><p> Methods for removing DNA, but not RNA, comprising PCA-mRNA sequences will use a reagent which is specific to a sequence within a PCA-mRNA e. g. a restriction enzyme which recognizes a DNA sequence within SEQ ID 4, but which does not cleave the corresponding
RNA sequence.</p><p> Methods for specifically purifying PCA-mRNAs from a sample may also be used. One such method uses an affinity support which binds to PCA-mRNAs. The affinity support may include a polypeptide sequence which binds to the PCAV-mRNA e. g. the cORF polypeptide, which binds to the LTR of HERV-K mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner, or HIV Rev protein, which has been shown to recognize the HERV-K LTR [3].</p><p> B. 2-Direct detection ofRNA 
Various techniques are available for detecting the presence or absence of a particular
RNA sequence in a sample [e. g. refs. 2 &amp; 8]. If a sample contains genomic PCAV DNA, the detection technique will generally be RNA-specific; if the sample contains no PCAV DNA, the detection technique may or may not be RNA-specific.</p><p> Hybridization-based detection techniques may be used, in which a polynucleotide probe complementary to a region of PCA-mRNA is contacted with a RNA-containing sample under hybridizing conditions. Detection of hybridization indicates that nucleic acid complementary to the probe is present. Hybridization techniques for use with RNA include Northern blots, in situ hybridization and arrays.</p><p> Sequencing may also be used, in which the sequence (s) of RNA molecules in a sample are obtained. These techniques reveal directly whether a sequence of interest is present in a sample. Sequence determination of the 5'end of a RNA corresponding to Nl will generally be adequate.</p><p> Amplification-based techniques may also be used. These include PCR, SDA, SSSR,
LCR, TMA, NASBA, T7 amplification etc. The technique preferably gives exponential amplification. A preferred technique for use with RNA is RT-PCR [e. g. see chapter 15 of ref. 2].</p><p>RT-PCR of mRNA from prostate cells is reported in references 4,5,6 &amp; 7.</p><p> B.3-Indirect detection o RNA 
Rather than detect RNA directly, it may be preferred to detect molecules which are derived from RNA (i. e. indirect detection of RNA). A typical indirect method of detecting mRNA is to prepare cDNA by reverse transcription and then to directly detect the cDNA. Direct detection of cDNA will generally use the same techniques as described above for direct detection of RNA (but it will be appreciated that methods such as RT-PCR are not suitable for DNA detection and that cDNA is double-stranded, so detection techniques can be based on a sequence, on its complement, or on the double-stranded molecule). ynucleotide materials

Where the method is based on polypeptide detection, it will involve detecting expression of a polypeptide encoded by a PCAV-mRNA. This will typically involve detecting one or more of the following HML-2 polypeptides: gag, prt, pol, env, cORF. Although some PCA-mRNAs encode all of these polypeptides (e. g. ERVK6 [1]), the polypeptide-coding regions of most
HERVs (including PCAVs) contain mutations which mean that one or more coding-regions in the mRNA transcript are either mutated or absent. Thus not all PCAVs have the ability to encode all HML-2 polypeptides.</p><p> The transcripts which encode HML-2 polypeptides are generated by alternative splicing of the full-length mRNA copy of the endogenous genome [e. g. Figure 4 of ref. 143].</p><p> HML-2 gag polypeptide is encoded by the first long ORF in a complete HML-2 genome [140]. Full-length gag polypeptide is proteolytically cleaved.</p><p> Examples of gag nucleotide sequences are: SEQ IDs 7,8,9 &amp; 11 [HERV-K (CH)]; SEQ

After amino acid 87, a splicing event removes env-coding sequences and the cORF-coding sequence continues in the reading frame +1 relative to that of env [15,16; see below]. cORF has also been called Rec [17].</p><p> Examples of cORF nucleotide sequences are: SEQ ID 89 and SEQ ID 90 [HERV

Examples of cORF polypeptide sequences are SEQ ID 109.</p><p> C. 1-Direct detection of HML-2 polvpeptides 
Various techniques are available for detecting the presence or absence of a particular polypeptides in a sample. These are generally immunoassay techniques which are based on the specific interaction between an antibody and an antigenic amino acid sequence in the polypeptide. Suitable techniques include standard immunohistological methods, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, ELISA, RIA, FIA, etc.</p><p> In general, therefore, the invention provides a method for detecting the presence of and/or measuring a level of a polypeptide of the invention in a biological sample, wherein the method uses an antibody specific for the polypeptide. The method generally comprises the steps of : a) contacting the sample with an antibody specific for the polypeptide; and b) detecting binding between the antibody and polypeptides in the sample.</p><p> Polypeptides of the invention can also be detected by functional assays e. g. assays to detect binding activity or enzymatic activity. For instance, a functional assay for cORF is disclosed in references 16,129 &amp; 130. A functional assay for the protease is disclosed in reference 140.</p><p> Another way for detecting polypeptides of the invention is to use standard proteomics techniques e. g. purify or separate polypeptides and then use peptide sequencing. For example, polypeptides can be separated using 2D-PAGE and polypeptide spots can be sequenced (e. g. by mass spectroscopy) in order to identify if a sequence is present in a target polypeptide.</p><p> Detection methods may be adapted for use in vivo (e. g. to locate or identify sites where cancer cells are present). In these embodiments, an antibody specific for a target polypeptide is administered to an individual (e. g. by injection) and the antibody is located using standard imaging techniques (e. g. magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography scanning, etc.). </p><p>Appropriate labels (e. g. spin labels etc.) will be used. Using these techniques, cancer cells are differentially labeled.</p><p> An immunofluorescence assay can be easily performed on cells without the need for purification of the target polypeptide. The cells are first fixed onto a solid support, such as a microscope slide or microtiter well. The membranes of the cells are then permeablized in order to permit entry of polypeptide-specific antibody (NB: fixing and permeabilization can be achieved together). Next, the fixed cells are exposed to an antibody which is specific for the encoded polypeptideand which is fluorescently labeled. The presence of this label (e. g. visualized under a microscope) identifies cells which express the target PCAV polypeptide. To increase the sensitivity of the assay, it is possible to use a second antibody to bind to the anti-PCAV antibody, with the label being carried by the second antibody.

T-and B-cell epitopes can be identified empirically (e. g. using the
PEPSCAN method [19,20] or similar methods), or they can be predicted (e. g. using the
Jameson-Wolf antigenic index [21], matrix-based approaches [22], TEPITOPE [23], neural networks [24], OptiMer &amp; EpiMer [25,26], ADEPT [27], Tsites [28], hydrophilicity [29], antigenic index [30] or the methods disclosed in reference 31 etc.). </p><p> References to a percentage sequence identity between two amino acid sequences means that, when aligned, that percentage of amino acids are the same in comparing the two sequences.</p><p>This alignment and the percent homology or sequence identity can be determined using software programs known in the art, for example those described in section 7.7.18 of reference 11.

The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be interrupted by nonamino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also included within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in the art. Polypeptides can occur as single chains or associated chains. Polypeptides of the invention can be naturally or non-naturally glycosylated (i. e. the polypeptide has a glycosylation pattern that differs from the glycosylation pattern found in the corresponding naturally occurring polypeptide).</p><p> Mutants can include amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions. The amino acid substitutions can be conservative amino acid substitutions or substitutions to eliminate nonessential amino acids, such as to alter a glycosylation site, a phosphorylation site or an acetylation site, or to minimize misfolding by substitution or deletion of one or more cystine residues that are not necessary for function. Conservative amino acid substitutions are those that preserve the general charge, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, and/or steric bulk of the amino acid substituted. Variants can be designed so as to retain or have enhanced biological activity of a particular region of the polypeptide (e. g. a functional domain and/or, where the polypeptide is a member of a polypeptide family, a region associated with a consensus sequence). Selection of amino acid alterations for production of variants can be based upon the accessibility (interior vs. exterior) of the amino acid (e. g. ref. 33), the thermostability of the variant polypeptide (e. g. ref.</p><p>34), desired glycosylation sites (e. g. ref. 35), desired disulfide bridges (e. g. refs. 36 &amp; 37), desired metal binding sites (e. g. refs. 38 &amp; 39), and desired substitutions with in proline loops (e. g. ref. 40).

Alternatively, the label may be detectable indirectly, such as an enzyme whose products are detectable (e. g. luciferase, 13-galactosidase, peroxidase etc.). </p><p> Antibodies of the invention may be attached to a solid support.</p><p> Antibodies of the invention may be prepared by administering (e. g. injecting) a polypeptide of the invention to an appropriate animal (e. g. a rabbit, hamster, mouse or other rodent).</p><p> Antigen-binding fragments of antibodies include Fv, scFv, Fc, Fab, F (ab') 2 etc.</p><p> To increase compatibility with the human immune system, the antibodies may be chimeric or humanized [e. g. refs. 42 &amp; 43], or fully human antibodies may be used. Because humanized antibodies are far less immunogenic in humans than the original non-human monoclonal antibodies, they can be used for the treatment of humans with far less risk, of anaphylaxis. Thus, these antibodies may be preferred in therapeutic applications that involve in vivo administration to a human such as, use as radiation sensitizers for the treatment of neoplastic disease or use in methods to reduce the side effects of cancer therapy.</p><p> Humanized antibodies may be achieved by a variety of methods including, for example: (1) grafting non-human complementarity determining regions (CDRs) onto a human framework and constant region ("humanizing"), with the optional transfer of one or more framework residues from the non-human antibody; (2) transplanting entire non-human variable domains, but "cloaking"them with a human-like surface by replacement of surface residues ("veneering"). In the present invention, humanized antibodies will include both"humanized"and"veneered" antibodies. [44,45,46,47,48,49,50].</p><p> CDRs are amino acid sequences which together define the binding affinity and specificity of a Fv region of a native immunoglobulin binding site [e. g. refs. 51 &amp; 52].</p><p> The phrase"constant region"refers to the portion of the antibody molecule that confers effector functions. In chimeric antibodies, mouse constant regions are substituted by human constant regions. The constant regions of humanized antibodies are derived from human immunoglobulins. The heavy chain constant region can be selected from any of the 5 isotypes: alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma or mu.</p><p> One method of humanizing antibodies comprises aligning the heavy and light chain sequences of a non-human antibody to human heavy and light chain sequences, replacing the non-human framework residues with human framework residues based on such alignment, molecular modeling of the conformation of the humanized sequence in comparison to the conformation of the non-human parent antibody, and repeated back mutation of residues in the framework region which disturb the structure of the non-human CDRs until the predicted conformation of the CDRs in the humanized sequence model closely approximates the conformation of the non-human CDRs of the parent non-human antibody. Such humanized antibodies may be further derivatized to facilitate uptake and clearance e. g, via Ashwell receptors. [refs. 53 &amp; 54] 
Humanized or fully-human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic animals that are engineered to contain human immunoglobulin loci. For example, ref. 55 discloses transgenic animals having a human Ig locus wherein the animals do not produce functional endogenous immunoglobulins due to the inactivation of endogenous heavy and light chain loci. Ref. 56 also discloses transgenic non-primate mammalian hosts capable of mounting an immune response to an immunogen, wherein the antibodies have primate constant and/or variable regions, and wherein the endogenous immunoglobulin-encoding loci are substituted or inactivated. Ref. 57 discloses the use of the Cre/Lox system to modify the immunoglobulin locus in a mammal, such as to replace all or a portion of the constant or variable region to form a modified antibody molecule. Ref. 58 discloses non-human mammalian hosts having inactivated endogenous Ig loci and functional human Ig loci. Ref. 59 discloses methods of making transgenic mice in which the mice lack endogenous heavy claims, and express an exogenous immunoglobulin locus comprising one or more xenogeneic constant regions.</p><p> Using a transgenic animal described above, an immune response can be produced to a
PCAV polypeptide, and antibody-producing cells can be removed from the animal and used to produce hybridomas that secrete human monoclonal antibodies. Immunization protocols, adjuvants, and the like are known in the art, and are used in immunization of, for example, a transgenic mouse as described in ref. 60. The monoclonal antibodies can be tested for the ability to inhibit or neutralize the biological activity or physiological effect of the corresponding polypeptide. </p><p> D-COMPARISON WITH CONTROL SAMPLES D. 1- The control  HML-2 transcripts are up-regulated in tumors, including prostate tumors. To detect such up-regulation, a reference point is needed i. e. a control. Analysis of the control sample gives a standard level of RNA and/or protein expression against which a patient sample can be compared.</p><p> A negative control gives a background or basal level of expression against which a patient sample can be compared. Higher levels of expression product relative to a negative control indicate that the patient from whom the sample was taken has, for example, prostate cancer. Typically, for prostate cancer, for example, negative controls would include lifetime baseline levels of expression or the expression level observed in pooled normals. Conversely, equivalent levels of expression product indicate that the patient does not have a HML-2-related cancer such as prostate cancer.</p><p> A positive control gives a level of expression against which a patient sample can be compared. Equivalent or higher levels of expression product relative to a positive control indicate that the patient from whom the sample was taken has cancer such as prostate cancer.</p><p>Conversely, lower levels of expression product indicate that the patient does not have a HML-2 related cancer such as prostate cancer.</p><p> For direct or indirect RNA measurement, or for direct polypeptide measurement, a negative control will generally comprise cells which are not from a tumor cell, e. g. a prostate tumor cell. For indirect polypeptide measurement, a negative control will generally be a blood sample from a patient who does not have a prostate tumor. The negative control could be a sample from the same patient as the patient sample, but from a tissue in which HML-2 expression is not up-regulated e. g. a non-tumor non-prostate cell. The negative control could be a prostate cell from the same patient as the patient sample, but taken at an earlier stage in the patient's life. The negative control could be a cell from a patient without a prostate tumor. This cell may or may not be a prostate cell. The negative control cell could be a prostate cell from a patient with BPH.</p><p> For direct or indirect RNA measurement, or for direct polypeptide measurement, a positive control will generally comprise cells from a tumor cell e. g. a prostate tumor. For indirect polypeptide measurement, a negative control will generally be a blood sample from a patient who has a prostate tumor. The positive control could be a prostate tumor cell from the same patient as the patient sample, but taken at an earlier stage in the patient's life (e. g. to monitor remission). The positive control could be a cell from another patient with a prostate tumor. The positive control could be a prostate cell line.</p><p> Other suitable positive and negative controls will be apparent to the skilled person.</p><p> HML-2 expression in the control can be assessed at the same time as expression in the patient sample. Alternatively, HML-2 expression in the control can be assessed separately (earlier or later).</p><p> Rather than actually compare two samples, however, the control may be an absolute value i. e. a level of expression which has been empirically determined from samples taken from prostate tumor patients (e. g. under standard conditions).</p><p> D. 2-Degree of up-regulation
The up-regulation relative to the control (100%) will usually be at least 150% (e. g. 200%, 250%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600% or more).</p><p> D. 3-Diagnosis
The invention provides a method for diagnosing prostate cancer. It will be appreciated that"diagnosis"according to the invention can range from a definite clinical diagnosis of disease to an indication that the patient should undergo further testing which may lead to a definite diagnosis. For example, the method of the invention can be used as part of a screening process, with positive samples being subjected to further analysis.</p><p> Furthermore, diagnosis includes monitoring the progress of cancer in a patient already known to have the cancer. Cancer can also be staged by the methods of the invention. Preferably, the cancer is prostate cancer.</p><p> The efficacy of a treatment regimen (therametrics) of a cancer associated can also monitored by the method of the invention e. g. to determine its efficacy.</p><p> Susceptibility to a cancer can also be detected e. g. where up-regulation of expression has occurred, but before cancer has developed. Prognostic methods are also encompassed.</p><p> All of these techniques fall within the general meaning of"diagnosis"in the present invention. </p><p> E-PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS
The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising polynucleotide, polypeptide, or antibody as defined above. The invention also provides their use as medicaments, and their use in the manufacture of medicaments for treating prostate cancer. The invention also provides a method for raising an immune response, comprising administering an immunogenic dose of polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention to an animal.</p><p> Pharmaceutical compositions encompassed by the present invention include as active agent, the polynucleotides, polypeptides, or antibodies of the invention disclosed herein in a therapeutically effective amount. An"effective amount"is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective amount is an amount that is sufficient to palliate, ameliorate, stabilize, reverse, slow or delay the symptoms and/or progression of prostate cancer.</p><p> The compositions can be used to treat cancer as well as metastases of primary cancer. In addition, the pharmaceutical compositions can be used in conjunction with conventional methods of cancer treatment, e. g. to sensitize tumors to radiation or conventional chemotherapy. The terms"treatment","treating","treat"and the like are used herein to generally refer to obtaining a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a disease or symptom thereof and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete stabilization or cure for a disease and/or adverse effect attributable to the disease."Treatment"as used herein covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, particularly a human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease or symptom from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease or symptom but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease symptom, i. e. arresting its development; or (c) relieving the disease symptom, i. e. causing regression of the disease or symptom.</p><p> Where the pharmaceutical composition comprises an antibody that specifically binds to a gene product encoded by a differentially expressed polynucleotide, the antibody can be coupled to a drug for delivery to a treatment site or coupled to a detectable label to facilitate imaging of a site comprising cancer cells, such as prostate cancer cells. Methods for coupling antibodies to drugs and detectable labels are well known in the art, as are methods for imaging using detectable labels. </p><p> The term"therapeutically effective amount"as used herein refers to an amount of a therapeutic agent to treat, ameliorate, or prevent a desired disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic or preventative effect. The effect can be detected by, for example, chemical markers or antigen levels. Therapeutic effects also include reduction in physical symptoms. The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subject's size and health, the nature and extent of the condition, and the therapeutics or combination of therapeutics selected for administration. The effective amount for a given situation is determined by routine experimentation and is within the judgment of the clinician. For purposes of the present invention, an effective dose will generally be from about O. Olmg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, or about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg or about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of the compositions of the present invention in the individual to which it is administered.</p><p> A pharmaceutical composition can also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p>The term"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier"refers to a carrier for administration of a therapeutic agent, such as antibodies or a polypeptide, genes, and other therapeutic agents. The term refers to any pharmaceutical carrier that does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition, and which can be administered without undue toxicity. Suitable carriers can be large, slowly metabolized macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers, and inactive virus particles. Such carriers are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers in therapeutic compositions can include liquids such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol. Auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, and the like, can also be present in such vehicles.</p><p>Typically, the therapeutic compositions are prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection can also be prepared. Liposomes are included within the definition of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can also be present in the pharmaceutical composition, e. g. mineral acid salts such as hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates, sulfates, and the like; and the salts of organic acids such as acetates, propionates, malonates, benzoates, and the like. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients is available in Remington : <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Science and Practice ofpharniacy (1995) Alfonso
Gennaro, Lippincott, Williams, &amp; Wilkins.</bibl></p><p> The composition is preferably sterile and/or pyrogen-free. It will typically be buffered around pH 7. </p><p> Once formulated, the compositions contemplated by the invention can be (1) administered directly to the subject (e. g. as polynucleotide, polypeptides, small molecule agonists or antagonists, and the like); or (2) delivered ex vivo, to cells derived from the subject (e. g. as in ex vivo gene therapy). Direct delivery of the compositions will generally be accomplished by parenteral injection, e. g. subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or intramuscularly, intratumoral or to the interstitial space of a tissue. Other modes of administration include oral and pulmonary administration, suppositories, and transdermal applications, needles, and gene guns or hyposprays. Dosage treatment can be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule.</p><p> Methods for the ex vivo delivery and reimplantation of transformed cells into a subject are known in the art [e. g. ref. 61]. Examples of cells useful in ex vivo applications include, for example, stem cells, particularly hematopoetic, lymph cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, or tumor cells. Generally, delivery of nucleic acids for both ex vivo and in vitro applications can be accomplished by, for example, dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide (s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei, all well known in the art.</p><p> Differential expression PCAV polynucleotides has been found to correlate with prostate tumors. The tumor can be amenable to treatment by administration of a therapeutic agent based on the provided polynucleotide, corresponding polypeptide or other corresponding molecule (e. g. antisense, ribozyme, etc.). In other embodiments, the disorder can be amenable to treatment by administration of a small molecule drug that, for example, serves as an inhibitor (antagonist) of the function of the encoded gene product of a gene having increased expression in cancerous cells relative to normal cells or as an agonist for gene products that are decreased in expression in cancerous cells (e. g. to promote the activity of gene products that act as tumor suppressors).</p><p> The dose and the means of administration of the inventive pharmaceutical compositions are determined based on the specific qualities of the therapeutic composition, the condition, age, and weight of the patient, the progression of the disease, and other relevant factors. For example, administration of polynucleotide therapeutic compositions agents includes local or systemic administration, including injection, oral administration, particle gun or catheterized administration, and topical administration. Preferably, the therapeutic polynucleotide composition contains an expression construct comprising a promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide of the invention. Various methods can be used to administer the therapeutic composition directly to a specific site in the body. For example, a small metastatic lesion is located and the therapeutic composition injected several times in several different locations within the body of tumor. Alternatively, arteries which serve a tumor are identified, and the therapeutic composition injected into such an artery, in order to deliver the composition directly into the tumor. A tumor that has a necrotic center is aspirated and the composition injected directly into the now empty center of the tumor. An antisense composition is directly administered to the surface of the tumor, for example, by topical application of the composition.</p><p>X-ray imaging is used to assist in certain of the above delivery methods.</p><p> Targeted delivery of therapeutic compositions containing an antisense polynucleotide, subgenomic polynucleotides, or antibodies to specific tissues can also be used. Receptormediated DNA delivery techniques are described in, for example, references 62 to 67.</p><p>Therapeutic compositions containing a polynucleotide are administered in a range of about 100 ng to about 200 mg of DNA for local administration in a gene therapy protocol. Concentration ranges of about 500 ng to about 50 mg, about 1 jj, g to about 2 mg, about 5 zig to about 500 pg, and about 20 u, g to about 100 pg of DNA can also be used during a gene therapy protocol.</p><p>Factors such as method of action (e. g. for enhancing or inhibiting levels of the encoded gene product) and efficacy of transformation and expression are considerations which will affect the dosage required for ultimate efficacy of the antisense subgenomic polynucleotides. Where greater expression is desired over a larger area of tissue, larger amounts of antisense subgenomic polynucleotides or the same amounts re-administered in a successive protocol of administrations, or several administrations to different adjacent or close tissue portions of, for example, a tumor site, may be required to effect a positive therapeutic outcome. In all cases, routine experimentation in clinical trials will determine specific ranges for optimal therapeutic effect.</p><p> The therapeutic polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention can be delivered using gene delivery vehicles. The gene delivery vehicle can be of viral or non-viral origin (see generally references 68,69,70 and 71). Expression of such coding sequences can be induced using endogenous mammalian or heterologous promoters. Expression of the coding sequence can be either constitutive or regulated.</p><p> Viral-based vectors for delivery of a desired polynucleotide and expression in a desired cell are well known in the art. Exemplary viral-based vehicles include, but are not limited to, recombinant retroviruses (e. g. references 72 to 82), alphavirus-based vectors (e. g. Sindbis virus vectors, Semliki forest virus (ATCC VR-67; ATCC VR-1247), Ross River virus (ATCC VR373; ATCC VR-1246) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (ATCC VR-923; ATCC VR1250; ATCC VR 1249; ATCC VR-532)), adenovirus vectors, and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (e. g. see refs. 83 to 88). Administration of DNA linked to killed adenovirus [89] can also be employed.</p><p> Non-viral delivery vehicles and methods can also be employed, including, but not limited to, polycationic condensed DNA linked or unlinked to killed adenovirus alone [e. g. 89], ligandlinked DNA [90], eukaryotic cell delivery vehicles cells [e. g. refs. 91 to 95] and nucleic charge neutralization or fusion with cell membranes. Naked DNA can also be employed. Exemplary naked DNA introduction methods are described in refs. 96 and 97. Liposomes that can act as gene delivery vehicles are described in refs. 98 to 102. Additional approaches are described in refs. 103 &amp; 104.</p><p> Further non-viral delivery suitable for use includes mechanical delivery systems such as the approach described in ref. 104. Moreover, the coding sequence and the product of expression of such can be delivered through deposition of photopolymerized hydrogel materials or use of ionizing radiation [e. g. refs. 105 &amp; 106]. Other conventional methods for gene delivery that can be used for delivery of the coding sequence include, for example, use of hand-held gene transfer particle gun [107] or use of ionizing radiation for activating transferred gene [108 &amp; 109].</p><p> Vaccinecompositions
The invention provides a composition comprising a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p> The composition may additionally comprise an adjuvant. For example, the composition may comprise one or more of the following adjuvants: (1) oil-in-water emulsion formulations (with or without other specific immunostimulating agents such as muramyl peptides (see below) or bacterial cell wall components), such as for example (a) Mu59 [110; Chapter 10 in ref.</p><p>111], containing 5% Squalene, 0.5% Tween 80, and 0.5% Span 85 (optionally containing MTP

Mixtures of different aluminium salts may also be used. The salt may take any suitable form (e. g. gel, crystalline, amorphous etc.); (15) chitosan; (16) cholera toxin or E. coli heat labile toxin, or detoxified mutants thereof [125]; (17) microparticles of poly (a hydroxy) acids, such as PLG; (18) other substances that act as immunostimulating agents to enhance the efficacy of the composition. Aluminium salts and/or MF59TM are preferred.</p><p> The composition is preferably sterile and/or pyrogen-free. It will typically be buffered around pH 7.</p><p> The composition is preferably an immunogenic composition and is more preferably a vaccine composition. The composition can be used to raise antibodies in a mammal (e. g. a human).</p><p> Vaccines of the invention may be prophylactic (i. e. to prevent disease) or therapeutic (i. e. to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of a disease).</p><p> Efficacy can be tested by monitoring expression of polynucleotides and/or polypeptides of the invention after administration of the composition of the invention. </p><p> F-SCREENING METHODS AND DRUG DESIGN
The invention provides methods of screening for compounds with activity against cancer, comprising: contacting a test compound with a tissue sample derived from a cell in which
HML-2 expression is up-regulated; or a cell line; and monitoring HML-2 expression in the sample. A decrease in expression indicates potential anti-cancer efficacy of the test compound.</p><p> The invention also provides methods of screening for compounds with activity against prostate cancer, comprising: contacting a test compound with a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention; and detecting a binding interaction between the test compound and the polynucleotide/polypeptide. A binding interaction indicates potential anti-cancer efficacy of the test compound.</p><p> The invention also provides methods of screening for compounds with activity against prostate cancer, comprising: contacting a test compound with a polypeptide of the invention; and assaying the function of the polypeptide. Inhibition of the polypeptide's function (e. g. loss of protease activity, loss of RNA export, loss of reverse transcriptase activity, loss of endonuclease activity, loss of integrase activity etc.) indicates potential anti-cancer efficacy of the test compound.</p><p> Typical test compounds include, but are not restricted to, peptides, peptoids, proteins, lipids, metals, nucleotides, nucleosides, small organic molecules, antibiotics, polyamines, and combinations and derivatives thereof. Small organic molecules have a molecular weight of more than 50 and less than about 2,500 daltons, and most preferably between about 300 and about 800 daltons. Complex mixtures of substances, such as extracts containing natural products, or the products of mixed combinatorial syntheses, can also be tested and the component that binds to the target RNA can be purified from the mixture in a subsequent step.</p><p> Test compounds may be derived from large libraries of synthetic or natural compounds.</p><p>For instance, synthetic compound libraries are commercially available from Maybridge
Chemical Co. (Trevillet, Cornwall, UK) or Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts may be used.</p><p>Additionally, test compounds may be synthetically produced using combinatorial chemistry either as individual compounds or as mixtures.</p><p> Agonists or antagonists of the polypeptides of the invention can be screened using any available method known in the art, such as signal transduction, antibody binding, receptor binding, mitogenic assays, chemotaxis assays, etc.. The assay conditions ideally should resemble the conditions under which the native activity is exhibited in vivo, that is, under physiologic pH, temperature, and ionic strength. Suitable agonists or antagonists will exhibit strong inhibition or enhancement of the native activity at concentrations that do not cause toxic side effects in the subject. Agonists or antagonists that compete for binding to the native polypeptide can require concentrations equal to or greater than the native concentration, while inhibitors capable of binding irreversibly to the polypeptide can be added in concentrations on the order of the native concentration.</p><p> Such screening and experimentation can lead to identification of an agonist or antagonist of a HML-2 polypeptide. Such agonists and antagonists can be used to modulate, enhance, or inhibit HML-2 expression and/or function. [126]
The present invention relates to methods of using the polypeptides of the invention (e. g. recombinantly produced HML-2 polypeptides) to screen compounds for their ability to bind or otherwise modulate, such as, inhibit, the activity of HML-2 polypeptides, and thus to identify compounds that can serve, for example, as agonists or antagonists of the HML-2 polypeptides. In one screening assay, the HML-2 polypeptide is incubated with cells susceptible to the growth stimulatory activity of HML-2, in the presence and absence of a test compound. The HML-2 activity altering or binding potential of the test compound is measured. Growth of the cells is then determined. A reduction in cell growth in the test sample indicates that the test compound binds to and thereby inactivates the HML-2 polypeptide, or otherwise inhibits the HML-2 polypeptide activity.</p><p> Transgenic animals (e. g. rodents) that have been transformed to over-express HML-2 genes can be used to screen compounds in vivo for the ability to inhibit development of tumors resulting from HML-2 over-expression or to treat such tumors once developed. Transgenic animals that have prostate tumors of increased invasive or malignant potential can be used to screen compounds, including antibodies or peptides, for their ability to inhibit the effect of HML-2 polypeptides. Such animals can be produced, for example, as described in the examples herein.</p><p> Screening procedures such as those described above are useful for identifying agents for their potential use in pharmacological intervention strategies in prostate cancer treatment.</p><p>Additionally, polynucleotide sequences corresponding to HML-2, including LTRs, may be used to assay for inhibitors of elevated gene expression. </p><p> Potent inhibitors of HERV-K protease are already known [127]. Inhibition of HERV-K protease by HIV-1 protease inhibitors has also been reported [128]. These compounds can be studied for use in prostate cancer therapy, and are also useful lead compounds for drug design.</p><p> Transdominant negative mutants of cORF have also been reported [129,130].</p><p>Transdominant cORF mutants can be studied for use in prostate cancer therapy.</p><p> Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to HML-2 mRNA can be used to selectively diminish or oblate the expression of the polypeptide. More specifically, antisense constructs or antisense oligonucleotides can be used to inhibit the production of HML-2 polypeptide (s) in prostate tumor cells. Antisense mRNA can be produced by transfecting into target cancer cells an expression vector with a HML-2 polynucleotide of the invention oriented in an antisense direction relative to the direction of PCAV-mRNA transcription. Appropriate vectors include viral vectors, including retroviral vectors, as well as non-viral vectors. Alternately, antisense oligonucleotides can be introduced directly into target cells to achieve the same goal.</p><p>Oligonucleotides can be selected/designed to achieve the highest level of specificity and, for example, to bind to a PCAV-mRNA at the initiator ATG.</p><p> Monoclonal antibodies to HML-2 polypeptides can be used to block the action of the polypeptides and thereby control growth of cancer cells. This can be accomplished by infusion of antibodies that bind to HML-2 polypeptides and block their action.</p><p> The invention also provides high-throughput screening methods for identifying compounds that bind to a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention. Preferably, all the biochemical steps for this assay are performed in a single solution in, for instance, a test tube or microtitre plate, and the test compounds are analyzed initially at a single compound concentration. for the purposes of high throughput screening, the experimental conditions are adjusted to achieve a proportion of test compounds identified as"positive"compounds from amongst the total compounds screened. The assay is preferably set to identify compounds with an appreciable affinity towards the target e. g., when 0.1% to 1% of the total test compounds from a large compound library are shown to bind to a given target with a Ki of 10aM or less (e. g. l, uM, 100nM, 10nM, or less) G-THE HML-2 FAMILY OF HUMANENDOGENOUS RETROYIRUSES 
Genomes of all eukaryotes contain multiple copies of sequences related to infectious retroviruses. These endogenous retroviruses have been well studied in mice where both true infectious forms and thousands of defective retrovirus-like elements (e. g. the IAP and Etn sequence families) exist. Some members of the IAP and Etn families are"active" retrotransposons since insertions of these elements have been documented which cause germ line mutations or oncogenic transformation.</p><p> Endogenous retroviruses were identified in human genomic DNA by their homology to retroviruses of other vertebrates [131,132]. It is believed that the human genome probably contains numerous copies of endogenous proviral DNAs, but little is known about their function.</p><p>Most HERV families have relatively few members (1-50) but one family (HERV-H) consists of -1000 copies per haploid genome distributed on all chromosomes. The large numbers and general transcriptional activity of HERVs in embryonic and tumor cell lines suggest that they could act as disease-causing insertional mutagens or affect adjacent gene expression in a neutral or beneficial way.</p><p> The K family of human endogenous retroviruses (HERV-K) is well known [133]. It is related to the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and is present in the genomes of humans, apes and old world monkeys, but several human HERV-K proviruses are unique to humans [134]. The HERV-K family is present at 30-50 full-length copies per haploid human genome and possesses long open reading frames that potentially are translated into viral proteins [135, 136]. </p><p>Two types of proviral genomes are known, which differ by the presence (type 2) or absence (type 1) of a stretch of 292 nucleotides in the overlapping boundary of the pol and env genes [137]. Some members of the HERV-K family are known to code for the gag protein and retroviral particles, which are both detectable in germ cell tumors and derived cell lines [138]. </p><p>Analysis of the RNA expression pattern of full-length HERV-K has also identified a doublyspliced RNA that encodes a 105 amino acid protein termed central ORF (cORF') which is a sequence-specific nuclear RNA export factor that is functionally equivalent to the Rev protein of
HIV [139]. HERV-K10 has been shown to encode a full-length gag homologous 73 kDa protein and a functional protease [140].</p><p> Patients suffering from germ cell tumors show high antibody titers against HERV-K gag and env proteins at the time of tumor detection [141]. In normal testis and testicular tumors the
HERV-K transmembrane envelope protein has been detected both in germ cells and tumor cells, but not in the surrounding tissue. In the case of testicular tumor, correlations between the expression of the env-specific mRNA, the presence of the transmembrane env, cORF and gag proteins and antibodies against HERV-K specific peptides in the serum of the patients, have been reported. Reference 142 reports that HERV-K10 gag and/or env proteins are synthesized in seminoma cells and that patients with those tumors exhibit relatively high antibody titers against gag and/or env.</p><p> Gag proteins released in form of particles from HERV-K have been identified in the cell culture supernatant of the teratocarcinoma derived cell line Tera 1. These retrovirus-like particles (termed"human teratocarcinoma derived virus"or HTDV) have been shown to have a 90% sequence homology to the HERV-K10 genome [138, 143].</p><p> While the HERV-K family is present in the genome of every human cell, a high level of expression of mRNAs, proteins and particles is observed only in human teratocarcinoma cell lines [144]. In other tissues and cell lines, only a basal level of expression of mRNA has been demonstrated even using very sensitive methods. The expression of retroviral proviruses is generally regulated by elements of the 5'long terminal repeat (LTR). Furthermore, the activation of expression of an endogenous retrovirus may trigger the expression of a downstream gene that triggers a neoplastic effect.</p><p> The sequence of HERV-K (II), which locates to chromosome 3, has been disclosed [145].</p><p> HML-2 is a subgroup of the HERV-K family [146]. HERV isolates which are members of the HML-2 subgroup include HERV-K10 [137,142], the 27 HML-2 viruses shown in Figure 4 of reference 147, HERV-K (C7) [148], HERV-K (II) [145], HERV-K (CH) Table 11 provides a list of all known members of the HML-2 subgroup of the HERV-K family as determined by searching the DoubleTwist database containing all genomic contigs with the sequence AF074086 using the Smith-Waterman algorithm with the default parameters: open gap penalty =-20 and extension penalty =-5.</p><p> The invention is based on the finding that HML-2 mRNA expression is up-regulated in prostate tumors. Because HML-2 is a well-recognized family, the skilled person will be able to determine without difficulty whether any particular endogenous retroviruses is or is not a
HML-2. Preferred members of the HML-2 family for use in accordance with the present invention are those whose proviral genome has an LTR which has at least 75% sequence identity to SEQ ID 150 (the LTR sequence from HML-2. HOM [1]). Example LTRs include SEQ IDs 151-154. </p><p> H-HERV-K (CH) 
The present invention is based on the discovery of elevated levels of multiple HML-2 polynucleotides in prostate tumor samples as compared to normal prostate tissue. One particular
HML-2 whose mRNA was found to be up-regulated is designated herein as'HERV-K (CH)'.</p><p>* Sequences from HERV-K (CH) are shown in SEQ IDs 14-39 and have been deposited with the ATCC (see Table 7). The skilled person will be able to classify any further HERV as
HERV-K (CH) or not based on sequence identity to these HERV-K (CH) polynucleotides.</p><p>Preferably such a comparison is to one or more, or all, of the polynucleotide sequences disclosed herein or of the polynucleotide inserts in the ATCC-deposited isolates. Alternatively, the skilled artisan can determine the sequence identity based on a comparison to any one or more, or all, of the sequences in SEQ IDs 7-10 and SEQ IDs 14-39 taking into consideration the spontaneous mutation rate associated with retroviral replication. Thus, it will be apparent when the differences in the sequences are consistent with a HERV-K (CH) isolate or consistent with another HERV.</p><p> HERV-K (CH) is therefore a specific member of the HML-2 subgroup which can be used in the invention as described above. It can also be used in methods previously described in relation to HERV-K e. g. the diagnosis of testicular cancer [142], autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis [149], insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) [150] etc.</p><p> H. 1-HER V-K (CH !

For example, by using appropriate wash conditions, variants can be identified where the allelic variant exhibits at most about 25-30% base pair (bp) mismatches relative to the selected polynucleotide probe. In general, allelic variants contain 15-25% bp mismatches, and can contain as little as even 5-15%, or 2-5%, or 1-2% bp mismatches, as well as a single bp mismatch.</p><p> The invention also encompasses homologs corresponding to any one of the polynucleotide sequences provided herein, where the source of homologous genes can be any mammalian species (e. g. primate species, particularly human ; rodents, such as rats, etc.). </p><p>Between mammalian species (e. g. human and primate), homologs generally have substantial sequence similarity (e. g. at least 75% sequence identity, usually at least 90%, more usually at least 95%) between nucleotide sequences. Sequence similarity is calculated based on a reference sequence, which may be a subset of a larger sequence, such as a conserved motif, coding region, flanking region, domain, etc. A reference sequence will usually be at least about 18 contiguous nt long, more usually at least about 30 nt long, and may extend to the complete sequence that is being compared.

HERV-K (CH) isolates are those having a nucleotide sequence identity of at least 98%, more preferably at least 99% to the 5'polymerase region shown in SEQ ID 12 which relates to reverse transcriptase, as measured by the alignment program GCG Gap (Suite Version 10.1) using the default parameters: open gap = 3 and extend gap = 1. Another typical classification of the relationship of retroviruses is based on the amino acid sequence similarities in the reverse transcriptase protein. Thus, an even more preferred class of HERV-K (CH) isolates are those having an amino acid sequence identity of at least 90%, more preferably 95% to the 5' polymerase region encoded by the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID 12, as determined by the Smith-Waterman homology search algorithm using an affine gap search with a gap open penalty of 12 and a gap extension penalty of 2, BLOSUM matrix of 62. Thus, these prostate cancer-associated polynucleotide sequences define a class of human endogenous retroviruses, designated herein as HERV-K (CH), whose members comprise variations which, without wanted to be bound by theory, may be due to the presence of polymorphisms or allelic variations.</p><p> H. 1. 5-HERV-K (CH) hybridizable sequences

Other polynucleotides and polynucleotide compositions contemplated by and within the scope of the present invention will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art when provided with the disclosure here. </p><p> H. 1. 8-General features of polynucleotides of the invention
General features of the polynucleotides described in this section H. 1 are the same as those described in section B. 4 above.</p><p> The isolated polynucleotides preferably comprise a polynucleotide having a HERV
K (CH) sequence.</p><p> A polynucleotide of the invention can encode all or a part of a polypeptide, such as the gag region, 5'pol region or 3'pol region of a human endogenous retrovirus. Double or single stranded fragments can be obtained from the DNA sequence by chemically synthesizing oligonucleotides in accordance with conventional methods, by restriction enzyme digestion, by
PCR amplification, etc.</p><p> Polynucleotides of the invention can be cDNAs or genomic DNAs, as well as fragments thereof, particularly fragments that encode a biologically active gene product and/or are useful in the methods disclosed herein (e. g. in diagnosis, as a unique identifier of a differentially expressed gene of interest, etc.). The term"cDNA"as used herein is intended to include all nucleic acids that share the arrangement of sequence elements found in native mature mRNA species, where sequence elements are exons and 3'and 5'non-coding regions. Normally mRNA species have contiguous exons, with the intervening introns, when present, being removed by nuclear RNA splicing, to create a continuous open reading frame encoding a polypeptide. mRNA species can also exist with both exons and introns, where the introns may be removed by alternative splicing. Furthermore it should be noted that different species of mRNAs encoded by the same genomic sequence can exist at varying levels in a cell, and detection of these various levels of mRNA species can be indicative of differential expression of the encoded gene product in the cell.</p><p> A genomic sequence of interest comprises the nucleic acid present between the initiation codon and the stop codon, as defined in the listed sequences, including all of the introns that are normally present in a native chromosome. It can further include the 3'and 5'untranslated regions found in the mature mRNA. It can further include specific transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, etc., including about 1 kb, but possibly more, of flanking genomic DNA at either the 5'and 3'end of the transcribed region. The genomic DNA can be isolated as a fragment of 100 kbp or smaller ; and substantially free of flanking chromosomal sequence. The genomic DNA flanking the coding region, either 3'and 5', or internal regulatory sequences as sometimes found in introns, contains sequences required for proper tissue, stage-specific, or disease-state specific expression.</p><p> Polynucleotides of the invention can be provided as linear molecules or within circular molecules, and can be provided within autonomously replicating molecules (vectors) or within molecules without replication sequences. Expression of the polynucleotides can be regulated by their own or by other regulatory sequences known in the art. The polynucleotides can be introduced into suitable host cells using a variety of techniques available in the art, such as transferrin polycation-mediated DNA transfer, transfection with naked or encapsulated nucleic acids, liposome-mediated DNA transfer, intracellular transportation of DNA-coated latex beads, protoplast fusion, viral infection, electroporation, gene gun, calcium phosphate-mediated transfection, and the like.</p><p> A polynucleotide sequence that is"shown in"or"depicted in"a SEQ ID NO or Figure means that the sequence is present as an identical contiguous sequence in the SEQ ID NO or
Figure. The term encompasses portions, or regions of the SEQ ID NO or Figure as well as the entire sequence contained within the SEQ ID NO or Figure.</p><p> H. 2-HERV-K (CH ! polvpeptides

SEQ ID 15 is provided in SEQ ID 56; a polypeptide sequence encoded by the polynucleotide having the sequence shown in SEQ ID 14, is shown in SEQ ID 57. A consensus 3'pol polypeptide sequence encoded by the polynucleotides having the sequence shown in SEQ IDs 21-27, inclusive, is provided in SEQ ID 58. </p><p> The polypeptides encompassed by the present invention include those encoded by polynucleotides of the invention, e. g. SEQ IDs 7-10 and SEQ IDs 14-39, as well as polynucleotides deposited with the ATCC as disclosed herein, as well as nucleic acids that, by virtue of the degeneracy of the genetic code, are not identical in sequence to the disclosed polynucleotides and encode the polypeptides. Thus, the invention includes within its scope a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide having the sequence of any one of the polynucleotide sequences provided herein, or a variant thereof.</p><p> While the over-expression of the polynucleotides associated with prostate tumor is observed, elevated levels of expression of the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides may likely play a role in prostate tumors.</p><p> Typically, in retroviruses, a single large gag polypeptide is synthesized (e. g. a 73 kDa gag protein in HERV-K10) which is subsequently cleaved into multiple functional peptides by a functional protease encoded by the pol or protease region of the genome. Overexpression of sequences corresponding to both gag and pol domains of the HERV-K (CH) suggest such a mechanism. Sequences corresponding to the env and the nuclear RNA transport protein cORF region of the HERV-K (CH) genome may also be overexpressed. The polypeptides encoded by the open reading frames within the over-expressed polynucleotide sequences may play a significant role in the progression of prostate tumors.</p><p> The detection of these polypeptides by antibodies or other reagents that specifically recognize them may aid in the early diagnosis of prostate tumor or any other cancers associated with the overexpression of these HERV-K (CH) sequences.</p><p> Furthermore, inhibition of the function of these polypeptides may suggest means for therapy and treatment of prostatic or other HERV-K (CH) sequence related cancers. One method of accomplishing such inhibition is by administration of vaccines as a preventative therapy or antibody-mediated drug therapy as a post-neoplasia regimen for treatment of such cancers.</p><p> H. 2.2-HERV-K fragments

SEQ IDs 50-55 provide a translation of the HERV-K (CH) polynucleotides having a sequence shown in SEQ IDs 21-26, inclusive, corresponding to the 3'region of pol.

The present invention also provides isolated antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof, that bind to a polypeptide of the present invention. The present invention also provides isolated antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof, that bind to a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide of the present invention. The present invention also provides isolated antibodies that bind to a polypeptide of the invention, or antigen binding fragment thereof, encoded by a polynucleotide made by the method comprising the following steps i) immunizing a host animal with a composition comprising said polypeptide of the present invention, or antigen binding fragment thereof, and ii) collecting cells from said host expressing antibodies against the antigen or antigen binding fragment thereof. The present invention also provides isolated antibodies that bind to a polypeptide, or antigen binding fragment thereof, encoded by a polynucleotide of the present invention made by the method comprising the following steps: providing a cell line producing an antibody, wherein said antibody binds to a polypeptide of the present invention, or antigen binding fragment thereof, encoded by a polynucleotide of the present invention and culturing said cell line under conditions wherein said antibodies are produced. In additional embodiments, the antibodies are collected and monoclonal antibodies are produced using the collected host cells or genetic material derived from the collected host cells. In additional embodiments, the antibody is a polyclonal antibody. In a further embodiment, the antibody is attached to a solid surface or further comprises a detectable label.</p><p> The present invention further provides antibodies, which may be isolated antibodies, that bind a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide described herein. Antibodies can be provided in a composition comprising the antibody and a buffer and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Antibodies specific for a polypeptide associated with cancer are useful in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic methods, as discussed in detail herein.</p><p> Expression products of a polynucleotide described herein, as well as the corresponding mRNA (particularly mRNAs having distinct secondary and/or tertiary structures), cDNA, or complete gene, or fragments of said expression products can be prepared and used for raising antibodies for experimental, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes. For polynucleotides to which a corresponding gene has not been assigned, this provides an additional method of identifying the corresponding gene. The polynucleotide or related cDNA is expressed as described above, and antibodies are prepared. These antibodies are specific to an epitope on the polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotide, and can precipitate or bind to the corresponding native polypeptide in a cell or tissue preparation or in a cell-free extract of an in vitro expression system.</p><p> Polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to the HERV-K (CH) polypeptides or an epitope thereof can be made for use in immunoassays by any of a number of methods known in the art.</p><p>By epitope reference is made to an antigenic determinant of a polypeptide. The presence of an epitope is demonstrated by the ability of an antibody to bind a polypeptide with specificity. Two antibodies are considered to be directed to the same epitope if they cross block each others binding to the same polypeptide.</p><p> One approach for preparing antibodies to a polypeptide is the selection and preparation of an amino acid sequence of all or part of the polypeptide, chemically synthesizing the sequence and injecting it into an appropriate animal, typically a rabbit, hamster or a mouse.</p><p> Oligopeptides can be selected as candidates for the production of an antibody to the
HERV-K (CH) polypeptide based upon the oligopeptides lying in hydrophilic regions, which are thus likely to be exposed in the mature polypeptide. Additional oligopeptides can be determined using, for example, the Antigenicity Index [30].</p><p> In other embodiments of the present invention, humanized monoclonal antibodies are provided, wherein the antibodies are specific for HERV-K (CH) polypeptides and do not appreciably bind other HERV polypeptides. The phrase"humanized antibody"refers to an antibody derived from a non-human antibody, typically a mouse monoclonal antibody.</p><p>Alternatively, a humanized antibody may be derived from a chimeric antibody that retains or substantially retains the antigen-binding properties of the parental, non-human, antibody but which exhibits diminished immunogenicity in humans as compared to the parental antibody. The phrase"chimeric antibody,"as used herein, refers to an antibody containing sequence derived from two different antibodies (see, e. g. ref. 153) which typically originate from different species.</p><p>Most typically, chimeric antibodies comprise human and murine antibody fragments, generally human constant and mouse variable regions.</p><p> In the present invention, HERV-K (CH) polypeptides of the invention and variants thereof are used to immunize a transgenic animal as described above. Monoclonal antibodies are made using methods known in the art, and the specificity of the antibodies is tested using isolated
HERV-K (CH) polypeptides.</p><p> Methods for preparation of the human or primate HERV-K (CH) or an epitope thereof include, but are not limited to chemical synthesis, recombinant DNA techniques or isolation from biological samples. Chemical synthesis of a peptide can be performed, for example, by the classical Merrifeld method of solid phase peptide synthesis [154] or the FMOC strategy on a
Rapid Automated Multiple Peptide Synthesis system (E. I. du Pont de Nemours Company, Wilmington, DE) [155].</p><p> Polyclonal antibodies can be prepared by immunizing rabbits or other animals by injecting antigen followed by subsequent boosts at appropriate intervals. The animals are bled and sera assayed against purified HERV-K (CH) usually by ELISA or by bioassay based upon the ability to block the action of HERV-K (CH). When using avian species, e. g. chicken, turkey and the like, the antibody can be isolated from the yolk of the egg. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared after the method of Milstein and Kohler by fusing splenocytes from immunized mice with continuously replicating tumor cells such as myeloma or lymphoma cells. [156,157,158].</p><p>The hybridoma cells so formed are then cloned by limiting dilution methods and supernates assayed for antibody production by ELISA, RIA or bioassay.</p><p> The unique ability of antibodies to recognize and specifically bind to target polypeptides provides an approach for treating an overexpression of the polypeptide. Thus, another aspect of the present invention provides for a method for preventing or treating diseases involving overexpression of a HERV-K (CH) polypeptide by treatment of a patient with specific antibodies to the HERV-K (CH) polypeptide.</p><p> Specific antibodies, either polyclonal or monoclonal, to the HERV-K (CH) polypeptides can be produced by any suitable method known in the art as discussed above. For example, murine or human monoclonal antibodies can be produced by hybridoma technology or, alternatively, the HERV-K (CH) polypeptides, or an immunologically active fragment thereof, or an anti-idiotypic antibody, or fragment thereof can be administered to an animal to elicit the production of antibodies capable of recognizing and binding to the HERV-K (CH) polypeptides.</p><p>Such antibodies can be from any class of antibodies including, but not limited to IgG, IgA, IgM,
IgD, and IgE or in the case of avian species, IgY and from any subclass of antibodies.</p><p> L~) vectors and host cells 
The present invention also encompasses vectors and host cells comprising an isolated polynucleotide of the present invention.</p><p> L~) kits, libraries and arrays 
The invention provides kits, electronic libraries and arrays comprising polynucleotides of the invention, for use in diagnosing the presence of cancer in a test sample.</p><p> In general, a library of polynucleotides is a collection of sequence information, which information is provided in either biochemical form (e. g. as a collection of polynucleotide molecules), or in electronic form (e. g. as a collection of polynucleotide sequences stored in a computer-readable form, as in a computer system and/or as part of a computer program). The sequence information of the polynucleotides can be used in a variety of ways, e. g. as a resource for gene discovery, as a representation of sequences expressed in a selected cell type (e. g. cell type markers), and/or as markers of a given disease or disease state. In general, a disease marker is a representation of a gene product that is present in all cells affected by disease either at an increased or decreased level relative to a normal cell (e. g. a cell of the same or similar type that is not substantially affected by disease). For example, a polynucleotide sequence in a library can be a polynucleotide that represents an mRNA, polypeptide, or other gene product encoded by the polynucleotide, that is either over-expressed or under-expressed in a tissue affected by cancer, such as prostate cancer relative to a normal (i. e. substantially disease-free) tissue, such as normal prostate tissue.</p><p> The nucleotide sequence information of the library can be embodied in any suitable form, e. g. electronic or biochemical forms. For example, a library of sequence information embodied in electronic form comprises an accessible computer data file (or, in biochemical form, a collection of nucleic acid molecules) that contains the representative nucleotide sequences of genes that are differentially expressed (e. g. over-expressed or under-expressed) as between, for example, i) a cancerous cell and a normal cell; ii) a cancerous cell and a dysplastic cell; iii) a cancerous cell and a cell affected by a disease or condition other than cancer; iv) a metastatic cancerous cell and a normal cell and/or non-metastatic cancerous cell; v) a malignant cancerous cell and a non-malignant cancerous cell (or a normal cell) and/or vi) a dysplastic cell relative to a normal cell. Other combinations and comparisons of cells affected by various diseases or stages of disease will be readily apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. Biochemical embodiments of the library include a collection of nucleic acids that have the sequences of the genes in the library, where the nucleic acids can correspond to the entire gene in the library or to a fragment thereof, as described in greater detail below.</p><p> The polynucleotide libraries of the subject invention generally comprise sequence information of a plurality of polynucleotide sequences, where at least one of the polynucleotides has a sequence of any of sequence described herein. By plurality is meant at least 2, usually at least 3 and can include up to all of the sequences described herein. The length and number of polynucleotides in the library will vary with the nature of the library, e. g. if the library is an oligonucleotide array, a cDNA array, a computer database of the sequence information, etc.</p><p> Where the library is an electronic library, the nucleic acid sequence information can be present in a variety of media."Media"refers to a manufacture, other than an isolated nucleic acid molecule, that contains the sequence information of the present invention. Such a manufacture provides the genome sequence or a subset thereof in a form that can be examined by means not directly applicable to the sequence as it exists in a nucleic acid. For example, the nucleotide sequence of the present invention, e. g. the nucleic acid sequences of any of the polynucleotides of the sequences described herein, can be recorded on computer readable media, e. g. any medium that can be read and accessed directly by a computer. Such media include, but are not limited to: magnetic storage media, such as a floppy disc, a hard disc storage medium, and a magnetic tape; optical storage media such as CD-ROM; electrical storage media such as RAM and ROM; and hybrids of these categories such as magnetic/optical storage media. One of skill in the art can readily appreciate how any of the presently known computer readable mediums can be used to create a manufacture comprising a recording of the present sequence information.</p><p>"Recorded"refers to a process for storing information on computer readable medium, using any such methods as known in the art. Any convenient data storage structure can be chosen, based on the means used to access the stored information. A variety of data processor programs and formats can be used for storage, e. g. word processing text file, database format, etc. In addition to the sequence information, electronic versions of libraries comprising one or more sequence described herein can be provided in conjunction or connection with other computer-readable information and/or other types of computer-readable files (e. g. searchable files, executable files, etc, including, but not limited to, for example, search program software, etc.). </p><p> By providing the nucleotide sequence in computer readable form, the information can be accessed for a variety of purposes. Computer software to access sequence information is publicly available. For example, the gapped BLAST [159] and BLAZE [160] search algorithms on a
Sybase system can be used to identify open reading frames (ORFs) within the genome that contain homology to ORFs from other organisms.</p><p> As used herein,"a computer-based system"refers to the hardware means, software means, and data storage means used to analyze the nucleotide sequence information of the present invention. The minimum hardware of the computer-based systems of the present invention comprises a central processing unit (CPU), input means, output means, and data storage means. A skilled artisan can readily appreciate that any one of the currently available computer-based system are suitable for use in the present invention. The data storage means can comprise any manufacture comprising a recording of the present sequence information as described above, or a memory access means that can access such a manufacture.</p><p> "Search means"refers to one or more programs implemented on the computer-based system, to compare a target sequence or target structural motif, or expression levels of a polynucleotide in a sample, with the stored sequence information. Search means can be used to identify fragments or regions of the genome that match a particular target sequence or target motif. A variety of known algorithms are publicly known and commercially available, e. g.</p><p>MacPattern (EMBL), BLASTN and BLASTX (NCBI). A"target sequence"can be any polynucleotide or amino acid sequence of six or more contiguous nucleotides or two or more amino acids, preferably from about 10 to 100 amino acids or from about 30 to 300 nt A variety of comparing means can be used to accomplish comparison of sequence information from a sample (e. g. to analyze target sequences, target motifs, or relative expression levels) with the data storage means. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that any one of the publicly available homology search programs can be used as the search means for the computer based systems of the present invention to accomplish comparison of target sequences and motifs. Computer programs to analyze expression levels in a sample and in controls are also known in the art.</p><p> A"target structural motif,"or"target motif,"refers to any rationally selected sequence or combination of sequences in which the sequence (s) are chosen based on a three-dimensional configuration that is formed upon the folding of the target motif, or on consensus sequences of regulatory or active sites. There are a variety of target motifs known in the art. Protein target motifs include, but arc not limited to, enzyme active sites and signal sequences. Nucleic acid target motifs include, but are not limited to, hairpin structures, promoter sequences and other expression elements such as binding sites for transcription factors.</p><p> A variety of structural formats for the input and output means can be used to input and output the information in the computer-based systems of the present invention. One format for an output means ranks the relative expression levels of different polynucleotides. Such presentation provides a skilled artisan with a ranking of relative expression levels to determine a gene expression profile.</p><p> As discussed above, the"library"as used herein also encompasses biochemical libraries of the polynucleotides of the sequences described herein, e. g. collections of nucleic acids representing the provided polynucleotides. The biochemical libraries can take a variety of forms, e. g. a solution of cDNAs, a pattern of probe nucleic acids stably associated with a surface of a solid support (i. e. an array) and the like. Of particular interest are nucleic acid arrays in which one or more of the genes described herein is represented by a sequence on the array. By array is meant an article of manufacture that has at least a substrate with at least two distinct nucleic acid targets on one of its surfaces, where the number of distinct nucleic acids can be considerably higher, typically being at least 10 nt, usually at least 20 nt and often at least 25 nt. A variety of different array formats have been developed and are known to those of skill in the art. The arrays of the subject invention find use in a variety of applications, including gene expression analysis, drug screening, mutation analysis and the like, as disclosed in the above-listed exemplary patent documents.</p><p> In addition to the above nucleic acid libraries, analogous libraries of polypeptides are also provided, where the where the polypeptides of the library will represent at least a portion of the polypeptides encoded by a gene corresponding to a sequence described herein.</p><p> Polynucleotide arrays provide a high throughput technique that can assay a large number of polynucleotides or polypeptides in a sample. This technology can be used as a tool to test for differential expression. A variety of methods of producing arrays, as well as variations of these methods, are known in the art and contemplated for use in the invention. For example, arrays can be created by spotting polynucleotide probes onto a substrate (e. g. glass, nitrocellulose, etc.) in a two-dimensional matrix or array having bound probes. The probes can be bound to the substrate by either covalent bonds or by non-specific interactions, such as hydrophobic interactions.</p><p>Samples of polynucleotides can be detectably labeled (e. g. using radioactive or fluorescent labels) and then hybridized to the probes. Double stranded polynucleotides, comprising the labeled sample polynucleotides bound to probe polynucleotides, can be detected once the unbound portion of the sample is washed away. Alternatively, the polynucleotides of the test sample can be immobilized on the array, and the probes detectably labeled. Techniques for constructing arrays and methods of using these arrays are described in, for example, references 161 to 177.</p><p> Arrays can be used to, for example, examine differential expression of genes and can be used to determine gene function. For example, arrays can be used to detect differential expression of a gene corresponding to a polynucleotide described herein, where expression is compared between a test cell and control cell (e. g. cancer cells and normal cells). For example, high expression of a particular message in a cancer cell, which is not observed in a corresponding normal cell, can indicate a cancer specific gene product. Exemplary uses of arrays are further described in, for example, references 178 and 179. Furthermore, many variations on methods of detection using arrays are well within the skill in the art and within the scope of the present invention. For example, rather than immobilizing the probe to a solid support, the test sample can be immobilized on a solid support which is then contacted with the probe.</p><p> A gene or polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a cancer cell when the polynucleotide is detected at higher or lower levels in cancer compared with a cell of the same cell type that is not cancerous. Typically, screening for polynucleotides differentially expressed focuses on a polynucleotide that is expressed such that, for example, mRNA is found at levels at least about 25%, at least about 50% to about 75%, at least about 90%, preferably at least about 2fold, more preferably at least about 5-fold, at least about 10-fold, or at least about 50-fold or more, higher (e. g. overexpressed) or lower (e. g. underexpressed) in a cancer cell when compared with a cell of the same cell type that is not cancerous. The comparison can be made between two tissues, for example, if one is using in situ hybridization or another assay method that allows some degree of discrimination among cell types in the tissue. The comparison may also be made between cells removed from their tissue source. Thus, a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a cancer cell would be of clinical significance with respect to cancer.</p><p> In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, an array comprises at least two polynucleotides, each having a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ IDs 14-39 and polynucleotides present in isolates deposited with the ATCC and having ATCC accession numbers PTA-2561, PTA-2572, PTA-2566, PTA-2571, PTA-2562, PTA-2573, PTA-2560, PTA2565, PTA-2568, PTA-2564, PTA-2569, PTA-2567, PTA-2559, PTA-2563, PTA-2570. In another preferred embodiment, an array comprises at least one polynucleotide having a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ IDs 14-39 and polynucleotides present in isolates deposited with the ATCC and having ATCC accession numbers PTA-2561, PTA-2572, PTA2566, PTA-2571, PTA-2562, PTA-2573, PTA-2560, PTA-2565, PTA-2568, PTA-2564, PTA2569, PTA-2567, PTA-2559, PTA-2563, PTA-2570 and at least one of a polynucleotide having a sequence shown in SEQ ID 42 or 43.</p><p> The polynucleotides described herein, as well as their gene products, are of particular interest as genetic or biochemical markers (e. g. in blood or tissues) that will detect the earliest changes along the carcinogenesis pathway and/or to monitor the efficacy of various therapies and preventive interventions. For example, the level of expression of certain polynucleotides can be indicative of a poorer prognosis, and therefore warrant more aggressive chemo-or radio-therapy for a patient or vice versa. The correlation of novel surrogate tumor specific features with response to treatment and outcome in patients can define prognostic indicators that allow the design of tailored therapy based on the molecular profile of the tumor. These therapies include antibody targeting, antagonists (e. g. small molecules), and gene therapy. Determining expression of certain polynucleotides and comparison of a patients profile with known expression in normal tissue and variants of the disease allows a determination of the best possible treatment for a patient, both in terms of specificity of treatment and in terms of comfort level of the patient.</p><p>Polynucleotide expression can also be used to better classify, and thus diagnose and treat, different forms and disease states of cancer. Two classifications widely used in oncology that can benefit from identification of the expression levels of the genes corresponding to the polynucleotides described herein are staging of the cancerous disorder, and grading the nature of the cancerous tissue.</p><p> The polynucleotides that correspond to differentially expressed genes, as well as their encoded gene products, can be useful to monitor patients having or susceptible to cancer to detect potentially malignant events at a molecular level before they are detectable at a gross morphological level. In addition, the polynucleotides described herein, as well as the genes corresponding to such polynucleotides, can be useful as therametrics, e. g. to assess the effectiveness of therapy by using the polynucleotides or their encoded gene products, to assess, for example, tumor burden in the patient before, during, and after therapy.</p><p> Furthermore, a polynucleotide identified as corresponding to a gene that is differentially expressed in, and thus is important for, one type of cancer can also have implications for development or risk of development of other types of cancer, e. g. where a polynucleotide represents a gene differentially expressed across various cancer types.</p><p> In another embodiment, the diagnostic and/or prognostic methods of the invention involve detection of expression of a selected set of genes in a test sample to produce a test expression pattern (TEP). The TEP is compared to a reference expression pattern (REP), which is generated by detection of expression of the selected set of genes in a reference sample (e. g. a positive or negative control sample). The selected set of genes includes at least one of the genes of the invention, which genes correspond to the polynucleotide sequences described herein. Of particular interest is a selected set of genes that includes gene differentially expressed in the disease for which the test sample is to be screened.</p><p> "Reference sequences"or"reference polynucleotides"as used herein in the context of differential gene expression analysis and diagnosis/prognosis refers to a selected set of polynucleotides, which selected set includes at least one or more of the differentially expressed polynucleotides described herein. A plurality of reference sequences, preferably comprising positive and negative control sequences, can be included as reference sequences. Additional suitable reference sequences are found in GenBank, Unigene, and other nucleotide sequence databases (including, e. g. expressed sequence tag (EST), partial, and full-length sequences).</p><p> "Reference array"means an array having reference sequences for use in hybridization with a sample, where the reference sequences include all, at least one of, or any subset of the differentially expressed polynucleotides described herein. Usually such an array will include at least 2 different reference sequences, and can include any one or all of the provided differentially expressed sequences. Arrays of interest can further comprise sequences, including polymorphisms, of other genetic sequences, particularly other sequences of interest for screening for a disease or disorder (e. g. cancer, dysplasia, or other related or unrelated diseases, disorders, or conditions). The oligonucleotide sequence on the array will usually be at least about 12 nt in length, and can be of about the length of the provided sequences, or can extend into the flanking regions to generate fragments of 100 nt to 200 nt in length or more. Reference arrays can be produced according to any suitable methods known in the art. For example, methods of producing large arrays of oligonucleotides are described in references 180 &amp; 181 using lightdirected synthesis techniques. Using a computer controlled system, a heterogeneous array of monomers is converted, through simultaneous coupling at a number of reaction sites, into a heterogeneous array of polymers. Alternatively, microarrays are generated by deposition of presynthesized oligonucleotides onto a solid substrate, for example as described in reference 182.</p><p> A"reference expression pattern"or"REP"as used herein refers to the relative levels of expression of a selected set of genes, particularly of differentially expressed genes, that is associated with a selected cell type, e. g. a normal cell, a cancerous cell, a cell exposed to an environmental stimulus, and the like. A"test expression pattern"or"TEP"refers to relative levels of expression of a selected set of genes, particularly of differentially expressed genes, in a test sample (e. g. a cell of unknown or suspected disease state, from which mRNA is isolated).</p><p> REPs can be generated in a variety of ways according to methods well known in the art.</p><p>For example, REPs can be generated by hybridizing a control sample to an array having a selected set of polynucleotides (particularly a selected set of differentially expressed polynucleotides), acquiring the hybridization data from the array, and storing the data in a format that allows for ready comparison of the REP with a TEP. Alternatively, all expressed sequences in a control sample can be isolated and sequenced, e. g. by isolating mRNA from a control sample, converting the mRNA into cDNA, and sequencing the cDNA. The resulting sequence information roughly or precisely reflects the identity and relative number of expressed sequences in the sample. The sequence information can then be stored in a format (e. g. a computer-readable format) that allows for ready comparison of the REP with a TEP. The REP can be normalized prior to or after data storage, and/or can be processed to selectively remove sequences of expressed genes that are of less interest or that might complicate analysis (e. g. some or all of the sequences associated with housekeeping genes can be eliminated from REP data).</p><p> TEPs can be generated in a manner similar to REPs, e. g. by hybridizing a test sample to an array having a selected set of polynucleotides, particularly a selected set of differentially expressed polynucleotides, acquiring the hybridization data from the array, and storing the data in a format that allows for ready comparison of the TEP with a REP. The REP and TEP to be used in a comparison can be generated simultaneously, or the TEP can be compared to previously generated and stored REPs.</p><p> In one embodiment of the invention, comparison of a TEP with a REP involves hybridizing a test sample with an array, where the reference array has one or more reference sequences for use in hybridization with a sample. The reference sequences include all, at least one of, or any subset of the differentially expressed polynucleotides described herein.</p><p>Hybridization data for the test sample is acquired, the data normalized, and the produced TEP compared with a REP generated using an array having the same or similar selected set of differentially expressed polynucleotides. Probes that correspond to sequences differentially expressed between the two samples will show decreased or increased hybridization efficiency for one of the samples relative to the other.</p><p> Methods for collection of data from hybridization of samples with a reference arrays are well known in the art. For example, the polynucleotides of the reference and test samples can be generated using a detectable fluorescent label, and hybridization of the polynucleotides in the samples detected by scanning the microarrays for the presence of the detectable label using, for example, a microscope and light source for directing light at a substrate. A photon counter detects fluorescence from the substrate, while an x-y translation stage varies the location of the substrate. A confocal detection device that can be used in the subject methods is described in reference 183. A scanning laser microscope is described in reference 163. A scan, using the appropriate excitation line, is performed for each fluorophore used. The digital images generated from the scan are then combined for subsequent analysis. For any particular array element, the ratio of the fluorescent signal from one sample (e. g. a test sample) is compared to the fluorescent signal from another sample (e. g. a reference sample), and the relative signal intensity determined.</p><p> Methods for analyzing the data collected from hybridization to arrays are well known in the art. For example, where detection of hybridization involves a fluorescent label, data analysis can include the steps of determining fluorescent intensity as a function of substrate position from the data collected, removing outliers, i. e. data deviating from a predetermined statistical distribution, and calculating the relative binding affinity of the targets from the remaining data.</p><p>The resulting data can be displayed as an image with the intensity in each region varying according to the binding affinity between targets and probes. </p><p> In general, the test sample is classified as having a gene expression profile corresponding to that associated with a disease or non-disease state by comparing the TEP generated from the test sample to one or more REPs generated from reference samples (e. g. from samples associated with cancer or specific stages of cancer, dysplasia, samples affected by a disease other than cancer, normal samples, etc.). The criteria for a match or a substantial match between a TEP and a REP include expression of the same or substantially the same set of reference genes, as well as expression of these reference genes at substantially the same levels (e. g. no significant difference between the samples for a signal associated with a selected reference sequence after normalization of the samples, or at least no greater than about 25% to about 40% difference in signal strength for a given reference sequence. In general, a pattern match between a TEP and a
REP includes a match in expression, preferably a match in qualitative or quantitative expression level, of at least one of, all or any subset of the differentially expressed genes of the invention.</p><p> Pattern matching can be performed manually, or can be performed using a computer program. Methods for preparation of substrate matrices (e. g. arrays), design of oligonucleotides for use with such matrices, labeling of probes, hybridization conditions, scanning of hybridized matrices, and analysis of patterns generated, including comparison analysis, are described e. g. in reference 184.</p><p> H. 6-HER V-K (CH !-based diasznostic 7nethods

PCR, TMA, bDNA, NAT or Nasba. In further embodiments, the polynucleotide is attached to a solid support.</p><p> The present invention also provides compositions comprising a test cell sample and an isolated polynucleotide of the present invention. The present invention further provides methods for detecting cancer associated with expression of a polypeptide in a test cell sample, comprising the steps of : i) detecting a level of expression of at least one polypeptide of the invention, or a fragment thereof and ii) comparing said level of expression of the polypeptide in the test sample with a level of expression of polypeptide in the control cell sample, wherein an altered level of expression of the polypeptide in the test cell sample relative to the level of expression of the polypeptide in the control cell sample is indicative of the presence of cancer in the test cell sample. The present invention also provides methods for detecting cancer associated with the presence of an antibody in a test cell sample, comprising the steps of i) detecting a level of an antibody of the present invention, and ii) comparing said level of said antibody in the test sample with a level of said antibody in the control cell sample, wherein an altered level of antibody in said test cell sample relative to the level of antibody in the control cell sample is indicative of the presence of cancer in the test cell sample. In some embodiments, the cancer is prostate cancer and in other embodiments, the cancer is testicular cancer.</p><p> This invention also provides methods for detecting cancer associated with elevated levels of HERV-K (CH) polynucleotides, in particular in prostate cancer, by means of (i) detecting polynucleotides having at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90% at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or at least 100% identity to the polynucleotide shown in
SEQ IDs 7-10 or to polynucleotides in isolates deposited with the ATCC and having ATCC deposit accession numbers PTA-2561, PTA-2572, PTA-2566, PTA-2571, PTA-2562, PTA2573, PTA-2560, PTA-2565, PTA-2568, PTA-2564, PTA-2569, PTA-2567, PTA-2559, PTA2563, PTA-2570, as measured by the alignment program GCG Gap (Suite Version 10.1) using the default parameters: open gap = 3 and extend gap = 1 or polynucleotides hybridizing under high stringency conditions to the polynucleotide shown in SEQ IDs 7-10; (ii) detecting polypeptides, or fragments thereof encoded by the sequences of (i); and (iii) detecting antibodies specific for one or more of the polypeptides. Furthermore, (iv) detecting particles associated with overexpression of HERV-K (CH) polynucleotides may also be used in the diagnosis of cancer, in particular, prostate cancer, and monitoring its progression. </p><p> The treatment regimen of a prostate or other cancer associated with elevated levels of HERV-K (CH) polynucleotides may also monitored by detecting levels of the polynucleotides and polypeptides in order to assess the staging of the cancer and/or efficacy of particular cancer therapies.</p><p> The present invention provides methods of using the polynucleotides described herein for detecting cancer cells, in particular prostate cancer cells, facilitating diagnosis of cancer and the severity of a cancer (e. g. tumor grade, tumor burden, and the like) in a subject, facilitating a determination of the prognosis of a subject, and assessing the responsiveness of the subject to therapy (e. g. by providing a measure of therapeutic effect through, for example, assessing tumor burden during or following a chemotherapeutic regimen). Detection can be based on detection of a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a cancer cell, and/or detection of a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a cancer cell. The detection methods of the invention can be conducted in vitro or in vivo, on isolated cells, or in whole tissues or a bodily fluid e. g. blood, plasma, serum, urine, and the like).</p><p> The detection methods can be provided as part of a kit. Thus, the invention further provides kits for detecting the presence and/or a level of a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a cancer cell (e. g. by detection of an mRNA encoded by the differentially expressed gene of interest), and/or a polypeptide encoded thereby, in a biological sample. Procedures using these kits can be performed by clinical laboratories, experimental laboratories, medical practitioners, or private individuals. The kits of the invention for detecting a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a cancer cell may comprise a moiety that specifically binds the polypeptide, which may be an antibody that binds the polypeptide or fragment thereof. The kits of the invention used for detecting a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a prostate cancer cell may comprise a moiety that specifically hybridizes to such a polynucleotide. The kit may optionally provide additional components that are useful in the procedure, including, but not limited to, buffers, developing reagents, labels, reacting surfaces, means for detection, control samples, standards, instructions, and interpretive information.</p><p> Accordingly, the present invention provides kits for detecting prostate cancer comprising at least one of polynucleotides having the sequence as shown in SEQ IDs 7-10, SEQ IDs 14-39, or fragments thereof, or having the sequence found in an isolate deposited with the ATCC and having ATCC accession numbers PTA-2561, PTA-2572, PTA-2566, PTA-2571, PTA-2562, 
PTA-2573, PTA-2560, PTA-2565, PTA-2568, PTA-2564, PTA-2569, PTA-2567, PTA-2559,
PTA-2563, PTA-2570 or fragments thereof.</p><p> In some embodiments, methods are provided for detecting a polypeptide encoded by a gene differentially expressed in a prostate cancer cell. Any of a variety of known methods can be used for detection, including, but not limited to, immunoassay, using antibody that binds the polypeptide, e. g. by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and the like; and functional assays for the encoded polypeptide, e. g. binding activity or enzymatic activity.</p><p> As will be readily apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan upon reading the present specification, the detection methods and other methods described herein can be readily varied.</p><p>Such variations are within the intended scope of the invention. For example, in the above detection scheme, the probe for use in detection can be immobilized on a solid support, and the test sample contacted with the immobilized probe. Binding of the test sample to the probe can then be detected in a variety of ways, e. g. by detecting a detectable label bound to the test sample to facilitate detected of test sample-immobilized probe complexes.</p><p> The present invention further provides methods for detecting the presence of and/or measuring a level of a polypeptide in a biological sample, which polypeptide is encoded by a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a prostate cancer cell, using an antibody specific for the encoded polypeptide. The methods generally comprise: a) contacting the sample with an antibody specific for a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a prostate cancer cell; and b) detecting binding between the antibody and molecules of the sample.</p><p> Detection of specific binding of the antibody specific for the encoded prostate cancerassociated polypeptide, when compared to a suitable control is an indication that encoded polypeptide is present in the sample. Suitable controls include a sample known not to contain the encoded polypeptide or known not to contain elevated levels of the polypeptide; such as normal prostate tissue, and a sample contacted with an antibody not specific for the encoded polypeptide, e. g. an anti-idiotype antibody. A variety of methods to detect specific antibodyantigen interactions are known in the art and can be used in the method, including, but not limited to, standard immunohistological methods, immunoprecipitation, an enzyme immunoassay, and a radioimmunoassay. In general, the specific antibody will be detectably labeled, either directly or indirectly. Direct labels include radioisotopes; enzymes whose products are detectable (e. g. luciferase, B-galactosidase, and the like); fluorescent labels (e. g. fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin, and the like); fluorescence emitting metals, e. g. l52Eu, or others of the lanthanide series, attached to the antibody through metal chelating groups such as EDTA; chemiluminescent compounds, e. g. luminol, isoluminol, acridinium salts, and the like; bioluminescent compounds, e. g. luciferin, aequorin (green fluorescent protein), and the like. The antibody may be attached (coupled) to an insoluble support, such as a polystyrene plate or a bead. Indirect labels include second antibodies specific for antibodies specific for the encoded polypeptide ("first specific antibody"), wherein the second antibody is labeled as described above; and members of specific binding pairs, e. g. biotin-avidin, and the like. The biological sample may be brought into contact with and immobilized on a solid support or carrier, such as nitrocellulose, that is capable of immobilizing cells, cell particles, or soluble proteins. The support may then be washed with suitable buffers, followed by contacting with a detectably-labeled first specific antibody. Detection methods are known in the art and will be chosen as appropriate to the signal emitted by the detectable label.</p><p>Detection is generally accomplished in comparison to suitable controls, and to appropriate standards.</p><p> In some embodiments, the methods are adapted for use in vivo, e. g. to locate or identify sites where cancer cells, such as prostate cancer cells, are present.</p><p> In some embodiments, methods are provided for detecting a cancer cell by detecting expression in the cell of a transcript that is differentially expressed in a cancer cell. Any of a variety of known methods can be used for detection, including, but not limited to, detection of a transcript by hybridization with a polynucleotide that hybridizes to a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a prostate cancer cell; detection of a transcript by a polymerase chain reaction using specific oligonucleotide primers; in situ hybridization of a cell using as a probe a polynucleotide that hybridizes to a gene that is differentially expressed in a prostate cancer cell.</p><p>The methods can be used to detect and/or measure mRNA levels of a gene that is differentially expressed in a prostate cancer cell. In some embodiments, the methods comprise: a) contacting a sample with a polynucleotide that corresponds to a differentially expressed gene described herein under conditions that allow hybridization; and b) detecting hybridization, if any.</p><p> Detection of differential hybridization, when compared to a suitable control, is an indication of the presence in the sample of a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a cancer cell. Appropriate controls include, for example, a sample which is known not to contain a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a cancer cell, and use of a labeled polynucleotide of the same"sense"as the polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in the cancer cell. In a preferred embodiment, the cancer cell is a prostate cancer cell. Conditions that allow hybridization are known in the art, and have been described in more detail above.</p><p>Detection can also be accomplished by any known method, including, but not limited to, in situ hybridization, PCR (polymerase chain reaction), RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR), TMA, bDNA, and Nasba and"Northern"or RNA blotting, or combinations of such techniques, using a suitably labeled polynucleotide. A variety of labels and labeling methods for polynucleotides are known in the art and can be used in the assay methods of the invention. Specific hybridization can be determined by comparison to appropriate controls.</p><p> Polynucleotide generally comprising at least 10 nt, at least 12nt or at least 15 contiguous nucleotides of a polynucleotide provided herein, such as, for example, those having the sequence as depicted in SEQ IDs 7-10, and 3-28, are used for a variety of purposes, such as probes for detection of and/or measurement of, transcription levels of a polynucleotide that is differentially expressed in a prostate cancer cell. A probe that hybridizes specifically to a polynucleotide disclosed herein should provide a detection signal at least 5-, 10-, or 20-fold higher than the background hybridization provided with other unrelated sequences. It should be noted that "probes used herein is meant to refer to a polynucleotide sequence used to detect a differentially expressed gene product in a test sample. As will be readily appreciated by the ordinarily skilled artisan, the probe can be detectably labeled and contacted with, for example, an array comprising immobilized polynucleotides obtained from a test sample (e. g. mRNA).</p><p>Alternatively, the probe can be immobilized on an array and the test sample detectably labeled.</p><p>These and other variations of the methods of the invention are well within the skill in the art and are within the scope of the invention.</p><p> Nucleotide probes are used to detect expression of a gene corresponding to the provided polynucleotide. In Northern blots, mRNA is separated electrophoretically and contacted with a probe. A probe is detected as hybridizing to an mRNA species of a particular size. The amount of hybridization can be quantitated to determine relative amounts of expression, for example under a particular condition. Probes are used for in situ hybridization to cells to detect expression. Probes can also be used in vivo for diagnostic detection of hybridizing sequences.</p><p>Probes are typically labeled with a radioactive isotope. Other types of detectable labels can be used such as chromophores, fluorophores, and enzymes. Other examples of nucleotide hybridization assays are described in refs. 185 and 186. </p><p> PCR is another means for detecting small amounts of target nucleic acids (see, e. g. refs.</p><p> 187, 188 &amp; 189). Two primer polynucleotides nucleotides that hybridize with the target nucleic acids are used to prime the reaction. The primers can be composed of sequence within or 3'and 5'to the HERV-K (CH) polynucleotides disclosed herein. Alternatively, if the primers are 3'and 5'to these polynucleotides, they need not hybridize to them or the complements. After amplification of the target with a thermostable polymerase, the amplified target nucleic acids can be detected by methods known in the art (e. g. Southern blot). mRNA or cDNA can also be detected by traditional blotting techniques (e. g. Southern blot, Northern blot, etc.) described in ref. 8 (e. g. without PCR amplification). In general, mRNA or cDNA generated from mRNA using a polymerase enzyme can be purified and separated using gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a solid support, such as nitrocellulose. The solid support is exposed to a labeled probe, washed to remove any unhybridized probe, and duplexes containing the labeled probe are detected.</p><p> Methods using PCR amplification can be performed on the DNA from a single cell, although it is convenient to use at least about 105 cells. The use of the polymerase chain reaction is described in ref. 190, and a review of techniques may be found in pages 14.2 to 14.33 of reference 8. A detectable label may be included in the amplification reaction. Suitable detectable labels include fluorochromes, (e. g. fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), rhodamine, Texas Red, phycoerythrin, allophycocyanin, 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM), 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX), 2', 7'-dimethoxy-4', 5'-dichloro-6-carboxyfluorescein, 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-FAM),
N, N, N', N'-tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA), or 6-carboxy-2', 4', 7', 4, 7hexachlorofluorescein (HEX)), radioactive labels, (e. g. 32p, 35S, 3H, etc.), and the like. The label may be a two stage system, where the polynucleotides is conjugated to biotin, haptens, etc. having a high affinity binding partner, e. g. avidin, specific antibodies, etc., where the binding partner is conjugated to a detectable label. The label may be conjugated to one or both of the primers. Alternatively, the pool of nucleotides used in the amplification is labeled, so as to incorporate the label into the amplification product.</p><p> The present invention further relates to methods of detecting/diagnosing a neoplastic or preneoplastic condition in a mammal (for example, a human).</p><p> Examples of conditions that can be detected/diagnosed in accordance with these methods include, but are not limited to prostate cancers. Polynucleotides corresponding to genes that exhibit the appropriate expression pattern can be used to detect prostate cancer in a subject.</p><p>Reference 191 reviews markers of cancer.</p><p> One detection/diagnostic method comprises : (a) obtaining from a mammal (eg a human) a biological sample, (b) detecting the presence in the sample of a HERV-K (CH) polypeptide and (c) comparing the amount of product present with that in a control sample. In accordance with this method, the presence in the sample of elevated levels of a HERV-K (CH) gene product indicates that the subject has a neoplastic or preneoplastic condition.</p><p> The compound is preferably a binding protein, e. g. an antibody, polyclonal or monoclonal, or antigen binding fragment thereof, which can be labeled with a detectable marker (eg fluorophore, chromophore or isotope, etc). Where appropriate, the compound can be attached to a solid support. Determination of formation of the complex can be effected by contacting the complex with a further compound (eg an antibody) that specifically binds to the first compound (or complex). Like the first compound, the further compound can be attached to a solid support and/or can be labeled with a detectable marker.</p><p> The identification of elevated levels of HERV-K (CH) polypeptide in accordance with the present invention makes possible the identification of subjects (patients) that are likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy. For example, a biological sample from a post-primary therapy subject (e. g. subject having undergone surgery) can be screened for the presence of circulating HERV
K (CH) polypeptide, the presence of elevated levels of the polypeptide, determined by studies of normal populations, being indicative of residual tumor tissue. Similarly, tissue from the cut site of a surgically removed tumor can be examined (e. g. by immunofluorescence), the presence of elevated levels of product (relative to the surrounding tissue) being indicative of incomplete removal of the tumor. The ability to identify such subjects makes it possible to tailor therapy to the needs of the particular subject. Subjects undergoing non-surgical therapy (e. g. chemotherapy or radiation therapy) can also be monitored, the presence in samples from such subjects of elevated levels of HERV-K (CH) polypeptide being indicative of the need for continued treatment. Staging of the disease (for example, for purposes of optimizing treatment regimens) can also be effected, for example, by prostate biopsy e. g. with antibody specific for a HERV
K (CH) polypeptide.</p><p> The present invention also relates to a kit that can be used in the detection of a HERV
K (CH) polypeptide. The kit can comprise a compound that specifically binds a HERV-K (CH) polypeptide, such as, for example, binding proteins including antibodies or binding fragments thereof (e. g. F (ab') 2 fragments) disposed within a container means. The kit can further comprise ancillary reagents, for processing the binding assay.</p><p> DEFINITIONS

Candidate polynucleotides that may represent genes differentially expressed in cancer were obtained from both publicly-available sources and from cDNA libraries generated from selected cell lines and patient tissues. A normalized cDNA library was prepared from one patient tumor tissue and cloned polynucleotides for spotting on microarrays were isolated from the library. Normal and tumor tissues from 13 patients were processed to generate T7 RNA polymerase transcribed polynucleotides, which were, in turn, assessed for expression in the microarrays. The tissues that served as sources for these libraries and polynucleotides are summarized in Table 4.</p><p> Normalization: The objective of normalization is to generate a cDNA library in which all transcripts expressed in a particular cell type or tissue are equally represented [refs. 192 &amp; 193], and therefore isolation of as few as 30,000 recombinant clones in an optimally normalized library may represent the entire gene expression repertoire of a cell, estimated to number 10,000 per cell. The source materials for generating the normalized prostate libraries were cryopreserved prostate tumor tissue from a patient with Gleason grade 3+3 adenocarcinoma and normal prostate biopsies from a pool of at-risk subjects under medical surveillance. Prostate epithelia were harvested directly from frozen sections of tissue by laser capture microdissection (LCM,
Arcturus Engineering Inc., Mountain View, CA), carried out according to methods well known in the art (e. g. ref. 194), to provide substantially homogenous cell samples.</p><p> Total RNA was extracted from LCM-harvested cells using RNeasy Protect Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following manufacturer's recommended procedures. RNA was quantified using RiboGreerfrm RNA quantification kit (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR). One ig of total RNA was reverse transcribed and PCR amplified using SMARTTM PCR cDNA synthesis kit (ClonTech, Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA products were size-selected by agarose gel electrophoresis using standard procedures (ref. 8). The cDNA was extracted using Bio 101 GenecleanX II kit (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). Normalization of the cDNA was carried out using kinetics of hybridization principles: 1.0 , g of cDNA was denatured by heat at 100 C for 10 minutes, then incubated at 42 C for 42 hours in the presence of 120 mM NaCl, 10 mM
Tris. HCl (pH=8.0), 5 mM EDTA. Na+ and 50% formamide. Single-stranded cDNA ("normalized"cDNA) was purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography (&amp;num;130-0520, BioRad,
Hercules, CA) following the manufacturer's recommended procedures, amplified and converted to double-stranded cDNA by three cycles of PCR amplification, and cloned into plasmid vectors using standard procedures (ref. 8). All primers/adaptors used in the normalization and cloning process are provided by the manufacturer in the SMARTY PCR cDNA synthesis kit (ClonTech,
Palo Alto, CA). Supercompetent cells (XL-2 Blue Ultracompetent Cells, Stratagene, California) were transfected with the normalized cDNA libraries, plated on plated on solid media and grown overnight at 36 C. </p><p> Characterization of normalized libraries: The sequences of 10,000 recombinants per library were analyzed by capillary sequencing using the ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, California). To determine the representation of transcripts in a library,
BLAST analysis was performed on the clone sequences to assign transcript identity to each isolated clone, i. e. the sequences of the isolated polynucleotides were first masked to eliminate low complexity sequences using the XBLAST masking program (refs. 195,196 and 197).</p><p>Generally, masking does not influence the final search results, except to eliminate sequences of relative little interest due to their low complexity, and to eliminate multiple"hits"based on similarity to repetitive regions common to multiple sequences e. g. Alu repeats. The remaining sequences were then used in a BLASTN vs. GenBank search. The sequences were also used as query sequence in a BLASTX vs. NRP (non-redundant proteins) database search.</p><p> Automated sequencing reactions were performed using a Perkin-Elmer PRISM Dye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit containing AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase, FS, according to the manufacturer's directions. The reactions were cycled on a GeneAmp PCR
System 9600 as per manufacturer's instructions, except that they were annealed at 20 C. or 30 
C. for one minute. Sequencing reactions were ethanol precipitated, pellets were resuspended in 8 microliters of loading buffer, 1.5 microliters was loaded on a sequencing gel, and the data was collected by an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Sequencer. (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).</p><p> The number of times a sequence is represented in a library is determined by performing sequence identity analysis on cloned cDNA sequences and assigning transcript identity to each isolated clone. First, each sequence was checked to see if it was a mitochondrial, bacterial or ribosomal contaminant. Such sequences were excluded from the subsequent analysis. Second, sequence artifacts (e. vector and repetitive elements) were masked and/or removed from each sequence.</p><p> The remaining sequences were compared via BLAST [198] to GenBank and EST databases for gene identification and were compared with each other via FastA [199] to calculate the frequency of cDNA appearance in the normalized cDNA library. The sequences were also searched against the GenBank and GeneSeq nucleotide databases using the BLASTN program (BLASTN 1.3MP [198]). Fourth, the sequences were analyzed against a non-redundant protein (NRP) database with the BLASTX program (BLASTX 1.3MP [198]). This protein database is a combination of the Swiss-Prot, PIR, and NCBI GenPept protein databases. The BLASTX program was run using the default BLOSUM-62 substitution matrix with the filter parameter: "xnu+seg". The score cutoff utilized was 75.</p><p> Assembly of overlapping clones into contigs was done using the program Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp.; Ann Arbor, Mich.). The assembled contigs were analyzed using the programs in the GCG package (Genetic Computer Group, University Research Park, 575
Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711) Suite Version 10.1.</p><p> Summary of polynucleotides described herein: Table 6 provides a summary of polynucleotides isolated as described above and identified as corresponding to a differentially expressed gene (see below). Specifically, Table 6 provides: 1) the HERVK ORF for each clone
ID ; 2) the clone ID assigned to each sequence; 3) the % patients having the expression ratio of &gt; /= 2X; &gt; /= 2-5X ; &gt; /= 5X ; and less than 1/2 X; and the Tumor/Normal mRNA Expression Ratio per patient"Pat", eg, patient 93, patient 95, patient 96, etc.</p><p> Detection of elevated levels of cDNA associated with prostate cancer using arravs  cDNA sequences representing a variety of candidate genes to be screened for differential expression in prostate cancer were assayed by hybridization on polynucleotide arrays. The cDNA sequences included cDNA clones isolated from cell lines or tissues as described above.</p><p>The cDNA sequences analyzed also included polynucleotides comprising sequence overlap with sequences in the Unigene database, and which encode a variety gene products of various origins, functionality, and levels of characterization. cDNAs were spotted onto reflective slides (Amersham) according to methods well known in the art at a density of 9,216 spots per slide representing 4608 sequences (including controls) spotted in duplicate, with approximately 0.8 u. l of an approximately 200ng/1 solution of cDNA. </p><p> PCR products of selected cDNA clones corresponding to the gene products of interest were prepared in a 50% DMSO solution. These PCR products were spotted onto Amersham aluminum microarray slides at a density of 9216 clones per array using a Molecular Dynamics
Generation III spotting robot. Clones were spotted in duplicate, for a total of 4608 different sequences per chip. cDNA probes were prepared from total RNA obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM, Arcturus Enginering Inc., Mountain View, CA) of tumor tissue samples and normal tissue samples isolated from the patients described above.</p><p> Total RNA was first reverse transcribed into cDNA using a primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, followed by second strand DNA synthesis. cDNA was then transcribed in vitro to produce antisense RNA using the T7 promoter-mediated expression (e. g. ref. 200), and the antisense RNA was then converted into cDNA. The second set of cDNAs were again transcribed in vitro, using the T7 promoter, to provide antisense RNA. This antisense RNA was then fluorescently labeled, or the RNA was again converted into cDNA, allowing for third round of T7-mediated amplification to produce more antisense RNA. Thus the procedure provided for two or three rounds of in vitro transcription to produce the final RNA used for fluorescent labeling. Probes were labeled by making fluorescently labeled cDNA from the RNA starting material. Fluorescently-labeled cDNAs prepared from the tumor RNA sample were compared to fluorescently labeled cDNAs prepared from normal cell RNA sample. For example, the cDNA probes from the normal cells were labeled with Cy3 fluorescent dye (green) and cDNA probes prepared from the tumor cells were labeled with Cy5 fluorescent dye (red).</p><p> The differential expression assay was performed by mixing equal amounts of probes from tumor cells and normal cells of the same patient. The arrays were pre-hybridized by incubation for about 2 hrs at 60 C in 5X SSC/0.2% SDS/1 mM EDTA, and then washed three times in water and twice in isopropanol. Following pre-hybridization of the array, the probe mixture was then hybridized to the array under conditions of high stringency (overnight at 42 C in 50% formamide, 5X SSC, and 0.2% SDS. After hybridization, the array was washed at 55 C three times as follows: 1) first wash in 1X SSC/0.2% SDS; 2) second wash in 0. 1X SSC/0. 2% SDS ; and 3) third wash in 0. 1X SSC.</p><p> The arrays were then scanned for green and red fluorescence using a Molecular
Dynamics Generation III dual color laser-scanner/detector. The images were processed using
BioDiscovery Autogene software, and the data from each scan set normalized. The experiment was repeated, this time labeling the two probes with the opposite color in order to perform the assay in both"color directions."Each experiment was sometimes repeated with two more slides (one in each color direction). The data from each scan was normalized, and the level fluorescence for each sequence on the array expressed as a ratio of the geometric mean of 8 replicate spots/genes from the four arrays or 4 replicate spots/gene from 2 arrays or some other permutation.</p><p> Table 6 summarizes the results for gene products differentially expressed in the prostate tumor samples relative to normal cells. The ratio of differential expression is expressed as the normalized hybridization signal associated with the tumor probe divided by the normalized hybridization signal with the normal probe ; thus, a ratio greater than 1 indicates that the gene product is increased in expression in cancerous cells relative to normal cells, while a ratio of less than 1 indicates the opposite. The results from each patient are identified by"Pat"with the corresponding patient identification number."Concordance"indicates the % of patients in which differential expression of the selected gene product in tumor cells was at least a two-fold different from normal cells.</p><p> In at least 79% of prostate patients assayed, 8 out of 10 genes, whose expression was elevated by at least 500%, were represented in HERV-K (CH) sequences.</p><p> Table 6 provides those gene products that were differentially expressed and were classified as gag, 5'-pol (reverse transcriptase) and 3'-pol (integrase) related sequences. It may be possible to examine the function of these gene products in development of cancer and metastasis through use of small molecule inhibitors known to affect the activity of such enzymes.</p><p> Analysis of o/"ePrc'CancertocM &lt; &lt; S'eMey!ce 
In order to determine whether there was homology to any known sequences, the PCR products of 16 different clones from one prostate tumor patient were sequenced. PCR products from these and other clones from the same library were spotted on DNA microarrays. RNA from 13 prostate tumor patients were assayed on the microarrays and then the full inserts of some of the 16 clones were sequenced (Table 6). </p><p> The 16 isolates were initially determined in a first pass sequencing reaction to have the sequences as shown in SEQ IDs 27-39, inclusive. The isolate from the normal prostate tissue was initially determined in a first pass sequencing reaction to have the sequence as shown in SEQ ID 41. A first pass sequencing reaction refers to a high-throughput process, where PCR reactions generate the sequencing template then sequencing is performed with one of the PCR primers, in a single direction. A search of public databases revealed that these 16 isolates have some degree of identity to regions of the human endogenous retrovirus HERV-K (II) sequence disclosed in
Genbank accession number AB047240 and shown in SEQ ID 44, and also to HERV-K (10), but are nonetheless unique.</p><p> The isolates were subjected to a second round of nucleic acid sequencing and were found to have the sequences as shown in SEQ IDs 14-26, inclusive. The isolate from the normal prostate tissue was subjected to a second round of nucleic acid sequencing and found to have the sequence as shown in SEQ ID 40. This second round of sequencing is a customized process, where sequencing is performed on purified dsDNA template in a DNA vector. Sequencing is done from both ends of the template, forward and reverse, with primers designed from the flanking regions of the vector, and new primers are synthesized for every additional reaction needed to span the entire insert.</p><p> The Genbank disclosure of HERV-K (II) provides only an incomplete characterization of its genetic features and no association with any disease. The Genbank disclosure characterizes
HERV-KII as having a gag gene located at nucleotide 2113-4116 and an env gene located at nucleotide 7437-8174. Detailed analysis of the reported HERV-K (II) sequence indicates that the
HERV-K (II) genome includes regions related to gag, protease, 5'-end of pol (reverse transcriptase) and 3'-end of pol (integrase) domains of a retrovirus. Specifically, the location of the protease gene is from about nucleotide 3917 to about 4920 and the location of the polymerase domain is from about nucleotide 4797 to about 7468.</p><p> Composite HERV-K (CH) polynucleotide sequences are shown in SEQ IDs 7,8,9 and 10 and Figure 1 provides a schematic illustration of a human endogenous retrovirus and the HERV
K (CH) species within the schematic illustration. SEQ ID 7 is a composite sequence of the polynucleotides SEQ IDs 14-16, inclusive, and has a consensus sequence as shown in SEQ ID 11. This region corresponds to the gag region of a human endogenous retrovirus. SEQ IDs 8 and 9 are composites sequence of the polynucleotides having a sequence as shown in SEQ IDs 1720, inclusive, and has a consensus sequence as shown in SEQ ID 12. This region corresponds to the 5'pol region of a human endogenous retrovirus. SEQ ID 10 is a composite sequence of the polynucleotides having a sequence as shown in SEQ IDs 21-26, inclusive, and has a consensus sequence as shown in SEQ ID 13. This region corresponds to the 3'pol region of a human endogenous retrovirus
Homology to HERV-K (II) gag region varied from 87% to 99%. Homology to HERV
K (II) 5'-pol (reverse transcriptase) region varied from 87% to 97%. Homology to HERV-K (B) 3'-pol (integrase) region was approximately 89%. When compared to the human endogenous provirus HERV-K10, the homology of the gag region clones was approximately 79%, the 5'-pol region between 81% and 89% and the 3'-pol region was approximately 89%. Table 5 illustrates the homology of the sequences of the individual clones with the corresponding HERV-K (Il) and
HERV-K (10) regions. Because the presence of polyA stretches in the HERV-K (CH) sequences (and deposited isolates) may be an artifact of cloning, the % identity shown in Table 5 was determined with alignments performed with polynucleotides excluding the terminal polyA stretch.</p><p> Consensus polynucleotide sequences SEQ IDs 11-13 were generated with Multiple
Sequence Alignment (MSA), a web implementation of the GCG Pileup and Pretty programs. The program uses a clustering algorithm similar to the Clustal program described in reference 201.</p><p>The default values for the alignments and consensus extraction were 8 for gap open and 2 for gap extension. The poling plurality or minimum number of like sequences specified to assign a residue to the consensus sequence was 2.</p><p> The polynucleotide sequences shown in SEQ IDs 14-16, inclusive, were used for the consensus polynucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID 11. The polynucleotide sequences shown in SEQ IDs 17-20, inclusive, were used for the consensus polynucleotide sequence shown in
SEQ ID 12. The polynucleotide sequences shown in SEQ IDs 21-26, inclusive, were used for the consensus polynucleotide shown in SEQ ID 13. The"N"represents where there is no qualifying minimum representative base. i. e. at least two sequences with the same base at that site.</p><p> Northern blotting of prostate cancer cell lines using nucleotides 243-end of SEQ ID 150 labeled as a probe indicates that they express PCAV transcripts of several sizes, corresponding to both full-length viral genomic sequences and to sub-genomic spliced transcripts (Figure 5).</p><p>Expression of such transcripts have also been observed in teratocarcinoma cell lines [15], as shown in lane 1 of figure 14. </p><p> Investigation of other huma1n e7sdoge7zous retroviruses 
HERV-K (CH) is a member of the HML-2 subgroup of the HERV-K family. HERV-K (II) and HERV-K (10) are also members of this sub-group.</p><p> The same microarray techniques as described above were used to study the expression of members of the HERV-K family in the HML-2 and HML-6 subgroups in prostate tumor tissue.</p><p>The expression of HERV-H viruses was also studied.</p><p> The results in table 9 show that HERV-H is not up-regulated in prostate tumors. The
HML-6 subgroup of HERV-K is also not up-regulated. The only endogenous retroviruses that are up-regulated in prostate tumors are in the HML-2 subgroup.</p><p> Investigation of tumors other than prostate tumors HML-2 endogenous retroviruses are up-regulated in prostate tumors. Tumor samples taken from patients with breast and colon cancer were investigated for up-regulation of HML-2 and HML-6 HERV-K viruses using the microarray techniques described above.</p><p> The results in table 10 show that the HML-2 viruses are up-regulated in tissue from prostate tumors, but not from colon or breast tumors. HML-6 expression is not up-regulated in any of the tumors.</p><p> Dec'OMqf7:SF-AyC77)MecayMMaocaHccea'M. </p><p> DNA from prostate cancer tissue and other human cancer tissues, human colon, normal human tissues including non-cancerous prostate, and from other human cell lines are extracted following the procedure of ref. 202. The DNA is re-suspended in a solution containing 0.05 M
Tris HC1 buffer, pH 7.8, and 0.1 mM EDTA, and the amount of DNA recovered is determined by microfluorometry using Hoechst 33258 dye [ref. 203].</p><p> Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is performed using Taq polymerase following the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Perkin Elmer Cetus) with regard to buffer, Mg2+, and nucleotide concentrations. Thermocycling is performed in a DNA cycler by denaturation at 94 C. for 3 min. followed by either 35 or 50 cycles of 94 C. for 1.5 min., 50 C. for 2 min. and 72 C. for 3 min. The ability of the PCR to amplify the selected regions of the HERV-K (CH) gene is tested by using a cloned HERV-K (CH) polynucleotide (s) as a positive template (s).</p><p>Optimal Mg, primer concentrations and requirements for the different cycling temperatures are determined with these templates. The master mix recommended by the manufacturer is used. To detect possible contamination of the master mix components, reactions without template are routinely tested.</p><p> Southern blotting and hybridization are performed as described in reference 204, using the cloned sequences labeled by the random primer procedure [205]. Prehybridization and hybridization are performed in a solution containing 6xSSPE, 5% Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide, 100 pg/ml denaturated salmon testis DNA, incubated for 18 hrs at 42 C., followed by washings with 2xSSC and 0.5% SDS at room temperature and at 37 C. and finally in 0. IxSSC with 0.5% SDS at 68 C. for 30 min (ref. 8). For paraffin-embedded tissue sections the conditions described in ref. 206 are followed using primers designed to detect a 250 bp sequence.</p><p> Expression of cloned polynucleotides in host cells.</p><p>* To study the polypeptide products of HERV-K (CH) cDNA, restriction fragments from the HERV-K (CH) cDNA are cloned into the expression vector pMT2 (pages 16.17-16.22 of ref.</p><p>8) and transfected into COS cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Transfections are performed employing calcium phosphate techniques (pages 16.32-16.40 of ref. 8) and cell lysates are prepared forty-eight hours after transfection from both transfected and untransfected
COS cells. Lysates are subjected to analysis by immunoblotting using anti-peptide antibody.</p><p> In immunoblotting experiments, preparation of cell lysates and electrophoresis are performed according to standard procedures. Protein concentration is determined using BioRad protein assay solutions. After semi-dry electrophoretic transfer to nitro-cellulose, the membranes are blocked in 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5,0.05% Tween-20 (TTBS) with 5% dry milk.</p><p>After washing in TTBS and incubation with secondary antibodies (Amersham), enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) protocols (Amersham) are performed as described by the manufacturer to facilitate detection.</p><p> Generation of antibodies against polvpe tp ides. </p><p> Polypeptides, unique to HERV-K (CH) are synthesized or isolated from bacterial or other (e. g. yeast, baculovirus) expression systems and conjugated to rabbit serum albumin (RSA) with m-maleimido benzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS) (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). </p><p>Immunization protocols with these peptides are performed according to standard methods.</p><p>Initially, a pre-bleed of the rabbits is performed prior to immunization. The first immunization includes Freund's complete adjuvant and 500 ig conjugated peptide or 100 ug purified peptide.</p><p>All subsequent immunizations, performed four weeks after the previous injection, include 
Freund's incomplete adjuvant with the same amount of protein. Bleeds are conducted seven to ten days after the immunizations.</p><p> For affinity purification of the antibodies, the corresponding HERV-K (CH) polypeptide is conjugated to RSA with MBS, and coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia, 
Sweden). Antiserum is diluted 10-fold in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated overnight with the affinity matrix. After washing, bound antibodies are eluted from the resin with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.5.</p><p> ELISA assav for Detecting HERV-K (CH) Gag and/or Pol related sequences. </p><p> To test blood samples for antibodies that bind specifically to recombinantly produced
HERV-K (CH) antigens, the following procedure is employed. After the recombinant HERV
K (CH) pol or gag or env related polypeptides are purified, the recombinant polypeptide is diluted in PBS to a concentration of 5 Mg/ml (500 ng/100 l). 100 microliters of the diluted antigen solution is added to each well of a 96-well Immulon 1 plate (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly,
Va.), and the plate is then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, or overnight at 4 C., and washed 3 times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. Blocking to reduce nonspecific binding of antibodies is accomplished by adding to each well 200 ul of a 1 % solution of bovine serum albumin in PBS/Tween 20 and incubation for 1 hour. After aspiration of the blocking solution, 100 ul of the primary antibody solution (anticoagulated whole blood, plasma, or serum), diluted in the range of 1/16 to 1/2048 in blocking solution, is added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4 C. The wells are then washed 3 times, and 1001 goat anti-human

C.), diluted 1/500 or 1/1000 in PBS/Tween 20,100, ul of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD, Sigma) solution is added to each well and incubated for 5-15 minutes. The OPD solution is prepared by dissolving a 5 mg OPD tablet in 50 ml 1% methanol in H20 and adding 50 pl 30% H202 immediately before use. The reaction is stopped by adding 251 of 4M HZS04 Absorbance are read at 490 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad).</p><p> Preparation of vaccines.</p><p> The present invention also relates to a method of stimulating an immune response against cells that express HERV-K (CH) polypeptides in a patient using HERV-K (CH) gag, and/or pol polypeptides of the invention that acts as an antigen produced by or associated with a malignant cell. This aspect of the invention provides a method of stimulating an immune response in a human against prostate cells or cells that express a HERV-K (CH) pol or gag polynucleotides and polypeptides. The method comprises the step of administering to a human an immunogenic amount of a polypeptide comprising: (a) the amino acid sequence of a human endogenous retrovirus HERV-K (CH) polypeptide or (b) a mutein or variant of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of a human endogenous retrovirus HERV-K (CH) polypeptide.</p><p> Generation of transt,-enic animals apressinz polypeptides as a means for testing : therapeutics.</p><p> HERV-K (CH) nucleic acids are used to generate genetically modified non-human animals, or site specific gene modifications thereof, in cell lines, for the study of function or regulation of prostate tumor-related genes, or to create animal models of diseases, including prostate cancer. The term"transgenic"is intended to encompass genetically modified animals having an exogenous HERV-K (CH) gene (s) that is stably transmitted in the host cells where the gene (s) may be altered in sequence to produce a modified polypeptide, or having an exogenous
HERV-K (CH) LTR promoter operably linked to a reporter gene. Transgenic animals may be made through a nucleic acid construct randomly integrated into the genome. Vectors for stable integration include plasmids, retroviruses and other animal viruses, YACs, and the like. Of interest are transgenic mammals, e. g. cows, pigs, goats, horses, etc., and particularly rodents, e. g. rats, mice, etc.</p><p> The modified cells or animals are useful in the study of HERV-K (CH) gene function and regulation. For example, a series of small deletions and/or substitutions may be made in the
HERV-K (CH) gene to determine the role of different domains in prostate tumorigenesis.</p><p>Specific constructs of interest include, but are not limited to, anti-sense constructs to block HERV-K (CH) gene expression, expression of dominant negative HERV-K (CH) gene mutations, and over-expression of a HERV-K (CH) gene. Expression of a HERV-K (CH) gene or variants thereof in cells or tissues where it is not normally expressed or at abnormal times of development is provided. In addition, by providing expression of polypeptides derived from HERV-K (CH) in cells in which it is otherwise not normally produced, changes in cellular behavior can be induced.</p><p> DNA constructs for random integration need not include regions of homology to mediate recombination. Conveniently, markers for positive and negative selection are included. For various techniques for transfecting mammalian cells, see ref. 207.</p><p> For embryonic stem (ES) cells, an ES cell line is employed, or embryonic cells is obtained freshly from a host, e. g. mouse, rat, guinea pig, etc. Such cells are grown on an appropriate fibroblast-feeder layer or grown in the presence of appropriate growth factors, such as leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF). When ES cells are transformed, they may be used to produce transgenic animals. After transformation, the cells are plated onto a feeder layer in an appropriate medium. Cells containing the construct may be detected by employing a selective medium. After sufficient time for colonies to grow, they are picked and analyzed for the occurrence of integration of the construct. Those colonies that are positive may then be used for embryo manipulation and blastocyst injection. Blastocysts are obtained from 4 to 6 week old superovulated females. The ES cells are trypsinized, and the modified cells are injected into the blastocoel of the blastocyst. After injection, the blastocysts are returned to each uterine horn of pseudopregnant females. Females are then allowed to go to term and the resulting chimeric animals screened for cells bearing the construct. By providing for a different phenotype of the blastocyst and the ES cells, chimeric progeny can be readily detected.</p><p> The chimeric animals are screened for the presence of the modified gene and males and females having the modification are mated to produce homozygous progeny. If the gene alterations cause lethality at some point in development, tissues or organs are maintained as allogeneic or congenic grafts or transplants, or in in vitro culture. The transgenic animals may be any non-human mammal, such as laboratory animals, domestic animals, etc. The transgenic animals are used in functional studies, drug screening, etc., e. g. to determine the effect of a candidate drug on prostate cancer, to test potential therapeutics or treatment regimens, etc.</p><p> Diagnostic Imaving Using HER V-K (CH ! Specific Antibodies 
The present invention encompasses the use of antibodies to HERV-K (CH) polypeptides to accurately stage prostate cancer patients at initial presentation and for early detection of metastatic spread of prostate cancer. Radioimmunoscintigraphy using monoclonal antibodies specific for HERV-K (CH) gag or HERV-K (CH) pol or portions thereof or other HERV-K (CH) polypeptides can provide an additional tumor-specific diagnostic test. The monoclonal antibodies of the instant invention are used for histopathological diagnosis of prostate carcinomas.</p><p> Subcutaneous human xenografts of prostate cancer cells in nude mice is used to test whether a technetium-99m (99'Tc)-labeled monoclonal antibody of the invention can successfully image the xenografted prostate cancer by external gamma scintography as described for seminoma cells in ref. 208. Each monoclonal antibody specific for a HERV-K (CH) polypeptide is purified from ascitic fluid of BALB/c mice bearing hybridoma tumors by affinity chromatography on polypeptide A-Sepharose. Purified antibodies, including control monoclonal antibodies such as an avidin-specific monoclonal antibody [209] are labeled with 99mTc following reduction, using the methods of refs. 210 and 211. Nude mice bearing human prostate cancer cells are injected intraperitoneally with 200-500 gCi of'9'Tc-labeled antibody. Twentyfour hours after injection, images of the mice are obtained using a Siemens ZLC3700 gamma camera equipped with a 6 mm pinhole collimator set approximately 8 cm from the animal. To determine monoclonal antibody biodistribution following imaging, the normal organs and tumors are removed, weighed, and the radioactivity of the tissues and a sample of the injectate are measured. Additionally, HERV-K (CH)-specific antibodies conjugated to antitumor compounds are used as prostate cancer-specific chemotherapy.</p><p>DEPOSITS
