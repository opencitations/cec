WHICH RECOGNIZE SURFACE PROTEINS FROM COAGULASE-NEGATIVE
STAPHYLOCOCCI AND STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS
Cross Reference to Related Applications
The present application claims the benefit of <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/298,098</bibl> filed June 15,2001.</p><p>Field of the Invention
The present invention relates in general to surface proteins from
Staphylococcus aureus and their active regions such as their A domains which have homologue proteins on coagulase-negative Staphylococci such as S. epidermidis and S. hemolyticus as well as antibodies which recognize said proteins, and in particular to isolated monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies which recognize specific proteins from Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci and which are cross-reactive against S. aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci and can thus be utilized in vaccines and methods useful for preventing or treating a wide variety of infections caused by staphylococcal bacteria.</p><p>Background of the Invention
The successful colonization of the host is a process required for most microorganisms to cause infections in animals and humans. Microbial adhesion is the first crucial step in a series of events that can eventually lead to disease.</p><p> Pathogenic microorganisms colonize the host by attaching to host tissues or serum conditioned implanted biomaterials, such as catheters, artificial joints, and vascular grafts, through specific adhesins present on the surface of the bacteria.</p><p> MSCRAMM (Ã‰Ds (Microbial Surface Components Recognizing Adhesive Matrix
Molecules) are a family of cell surface adhesins that recognize and specifically bind to distinct components in the host's extracellular matrix. Once the bacteria have successfully adhered and colonized host tissues, their physiology is dramatically altered and damaging components such as toxins and proteolytic enzymes are secreted. Moreover, adherent bacteria often produce a biofilm and quickly become more resistant to the killing effect of most antibiotics. </p><p> S. aureus causes a spectrum of infections that range from cutaneous lesions such as wound infections, impetigo, and furuncles to life-threatening conditions that include pneumonia, septic arthritis, sepsis, endocarditis, and biomaterial related infections. S. aureus is known to express a repertoire of different MSCRAMMs that can act individually or in concert to facilitate microbial adhesion to specific host tissue components. In addition, another type of staphylococcus bacteria is identified as the coagulase-negative bacteria, including such species as S. epidermidis and S. hemolyticus which are also have been known to express
MSCRAMMs, and which also are responsible for a wide range of bacterial infections and related diseases. In this regard, MSCRAMMs generally provide an excellent target for immunological attack by antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies.</p><p> However, because antibodies by nature are very specific and in the case of different types of Staphylococci, such as S. aureus on one hand (coagulasepositive) and S. epidermidis and S. hemolyticus on the other (coagulase-negative), it has still remained a significant problem to develop antibodies that exhibit crossreactivity across the different types of bacteria. Such cross-reactive antibodies are particularly desirable because of their potential in immunizing human and animal patients and providing protection against infections caused by both types of
Staphylococcal bacteria, namely coagulase-positive bacteria such as S. aureus and the coagulase-negative bacteria, such as S. epidermidis and S. hemolyticus. Such antibodies would thus be extremely useful in preventing or treating a wide variety of the infections caused by staphylococcal bacteria.</p><p>Summary of the Invention
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide monoclonal antibodies that recognize MSCRAMMO's from both coagulase-positive bacteria such as S. aureus as well as MSCRAMMO's from coagulase-negative bacteria, such as S. epidermidis and S. hemolyticus. </p><p> It is also an object of the present invention to identify and isolate MSCRAMM&amp;commat;'s from staphylococcal bacteria, as well as their active regions such as the A domain, which can be used to generate monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that will be cross-reactive against both coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci.</p><p> It is still further an object of the present invention to provide isolated antibodies that can recognize the A domain of surface proteins such as the DgsK protein from coagulase-negative staphylococci and at the same time recognize surface proteins such as the SasA protein from Staphylococcus aureus.</p><p> It is yet another object of the present invention to utilize the isolated proteins,
A domains and antibodies of the invention to produce vaccines useful in the treatment or prevention of staphylococcal infections, and to provide methods wherein the vaccines and antibodies of the invention are used to prevent or treat a staphylococcal infection.</p><p> These and other objects are provided by virtue of the present invention which comprises the identification and isolation of surface proteins from one type of staphylococcal bacteria, such as coagulase-negative or coagulase-positive staph, which can give rise to cross-reactive antibodies which can recognize surface proteins of both types of staph and which can thus be utilized in vaccines and methods of treating or preventing a wide range of staphylococcal infections. The present invention also relates to the generation of both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies from these surface proteins and their use in preventing or treating staphylococcal infections.</p><p> These embodiments and other alternatives and modifications within the spirit and scope of the disclosed invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from reading the present specification and/or the references cited herein, all of which are incorporated by reference.</p><p>Brief Description of the Drawing Figures

In accordance with the present invention, there are provided specific surface proteins from coagulase-positive staphylococcal bacteria, such as S. aureus as well as from coagulase-negative staph such as S. epidermidis and S. hemolyticus, including active fragments thereof such as the A domains of these proteins or other epitotic regions which can generate antibodies that recognize the whole protein. In accordance with the invention, the identification and isolation of candidate peptide sequences and proteins was carried out based on some of the common features of the MSCRAMMOs ((Microbial Surface Components Recognizing Adhesive Matrix
Molecules) which are in most cases are covalently anchored to the cell wall peptidoglycan. These surface proteins had the following common features which were utilized in identifying and isolated the sequences of the present invention, namely : (i) an IN-terminal signal peptide (approximately 40 residues in length) required for Sec-dependent secretion, (ii) a wall spanning domain either rich in proline and glycine residues or composed of serine and aspartate dipeptide repeats, (iii) an LPXTG motif required for covalent anchoring of the protein to the pentaglycine crossbridge in peptidoglycan, (iv) a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain followed by (v) several positively charged residues.</p><p> In accordance with the invention, by exploiting the whole genome of S. aureus in light of the properties as set forth above, at least eight novel open reading frames encoding proteins with secretion and anchorage motifs indicative of
MSCRAMMs were identified (i. e. bearing an N-terminal signal peptide and a Cterminal LPXTG motif followed by a hydrophobic domain and a positively charged tail). Table 1 illustrates the list of proteins identified including their distribution among S. aureus genomes, their protein size and C-terminal cell wall sorting sequence.</p><p>Table 1.

These antibodies may be either monoclonal or polyclonal. If polyclonal antibodies are desired, these may be generated in any of a number of conventional ways well known in the art. In a typical process, the desired surface protein or active region thereof may be injected into a suitable host animal, e. g., a mouse or rabbit, and after a suitable time period, antibodies may be isolated and recovered from the host animal. With regard to monoclonal antibodies, in accordance with the present invention, these may be produced in any number of suitable ways including, e. g., the well known method of <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256: 495-497 (1975)</bibl>, or other suitable ways known in the field, such as those methods disclosed in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Pat. Nos. 6,331,415; 5,981,216; 5,807,715; and 4,816,567</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Eur. Pat. App. 519,596</bibl>; and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">PCT publication
WO 00/71585</bibl>, all of these patent publications incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>These methods include their preparation as chimeric, humanized, or human monoclonal antibodies in ways that would be well known in this field. Still further, monoclonal antibodies may be prepared from a single chain, such as the light or heavy chains, and in addition may be prepared from active fragments of an antibody which retain the binding characteristics (e. g., specificity and/or affinity) of the whole antibody. By active fragments is meant an antibody fragment which has the same binding specificity as a complete antibody which binds to the particular surface protein or its homologue from the different type of staph bacteria (i. e., coagulase negative or coagulase-positive), and the term"antibody"as used herein is meant to include said fragments. Additionally, antisera prepared using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies in accordance with the invention are also contemplated and may be prepared in a number of suitable ways as would be recognized by one skilled in the art.</p><p> As indicated above, antibodies to the isolated surface proteins and/or their active regions in accordance with the invention may be prepared in a number of suitable ways that would be well known in the art, such as the well-established
Kohler and Milstein method described above which can be utilized to generate monoclonal antibodies. For example, in preliminary steps utilized in such a process, mice may be injected intraperitoneally once a week for a prolonged period with a purified recombinant MSCRAMMO in accordance with the invention or an active portion thereof, followed by a test of blood obtained from the immunized mice to determine reactivity to the purified protein. Following identification of mice reactive to the proteins, lymphocytes isolated from mouse spleens are fused to mouse myeloma cells to produce hybridomas positive for the antibodies against the surface proteins of the invention which are then isolated and cultured, following by purification and isotyping.</p><p> In order to generate monoclonal antibodies in accordance with the invention, it is preferred that these be generated using recombinantly prepared MSCRAMMO's in accordance with the invention, and these recombinants may be generated and isolated using a number of standard methods well known in the art. For example, one such method employs the use of E coli expression vector pQE-30 as an expression vector for cloning and expressing recombinant proteins and peptides. In one preferred method, using PCR, the A domain of the surface protein identified as
DgsK or SasA was amplified from the sequences described above and subcloned into the E. coli expression vector PQE-30 (Qiagen), which allows for the expression of a recombinant fusion protein containing six histidine residues. This vector was subsequently transformed into E. coli strain ATCC 55151, grown in a 15-liter fermentor to an optical density (OD600) of 0.7 and induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-1beta-D galactoside (IPTG) for 4 hours. The cells were harvested using an AG
Technologies hollow-fiber assembly (pore size 0.45 um) and the cell paste frozen at - 80 C. Cells were lysed in 1X PBS (10 mL buffer/1 g of cell paste) using 2 passes through the French Press &amp;commat; 1100psi. Lysed cells were spun down at 17,000rpm for 30 minutes to remove cell debris. Supernatant was passed over a 5-mL HiTrap
Cheating (Pharmacia) column charged with 0. 1M NiCI2. After loading, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of 10mM Tris, pH 8.0,100mM NaCI (Buffer A).</p><p>Protein was eluted using a 0-100% gradient of 1'OmM Tris, pH 8.0,100mM NaCI, 200 mM imidazole (Buffer B) over 30 column volumes. SdrGN1N2N3 or SdrGN2N3 eluted at-13% Buffer B (-26mM imidazole). Absorbance at 280nm was monitored.</p><p>Fractions containing SdrGN1 N2N3 or SdrGN2N3 were dialyzed in 1x PBS.</p><p> Next, each protein was then put through an endotoxin removal protocol.</p><p>Buffers used during this protocol were made endotoxin free by passing over a 5-mL
Mono-Q sepharose (Pharmacia) column. Protein was divided evenly between 4x 15mL tubes. The volume of each tube was brought to 9mL with Buffer A. 1 mL of 10% Triton X-114 was added to each tube and incubated with rotation for 1 hour at 4 C. Tubes were placed in a 37 C water bath to separate phases. Tubes were spun down at 2,000rpm for 10 minutes and the upper aqueous phase from each tube was collected and the detergent extraction repeated. Aqueous phases from the 2nd extraction were combined and passed over a 5-mL IDA cheating (Sigma) column, charged with 0. 1M NiCl2 to remove remaining detergent. The column was washed with 9 column volumes of Buffer A before the protein was eluted with 3 column volumes of Buffer B. The eluant was passed over a 5-mL Detoxigel (Sigma) column and the flow-through collected and reapplied to the column. The flow-through from the second pass was collected and dialyzed in 1x PBS. The purified product was analyzed for concentration, purity and endotoxin level before administration into the mice.</p><p> In the preferred process, monoclonal antibodies in accordance with the present invention may be prepared from the recombinant proteins identified above in the following manner. In this process, E. coli expressed and purified recombinant
SasA and DsgK proteins were used to generate a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies while the mouse sera was used as a source of polyclonal antibodies.</p><p>Briefly, a group of Balb/C or SJL mice received a series of subcutaneous immunizations of 1-10 mg of protein in solution or mixed with adjuvant as described below in Table 2.</p><p> Table 2.

At the time of sacrifice (RIMMS) or seven days after a boost (conventional) serum was collected and titered in ELISA assays against MSCRAMMX proteins or on whole cells (S. epidermidis and S. aureus). Three days after the final boost, the spleens or lymph nodes were removed, teased into a single cell suspension and the lymphocytes harvested. Lymphocytes were then fused to a P3X63Ag8.653 myeloma cell line (ATCC &amp;num;CRL-1580). Cell fusion, subsequent plating and feeding were performed according to the Production of Monoclonal Antibodies protocol from
Current Protocols in Immunology (Chapter 2, Unit 2.), incorporated herein by reference. </p><p> Any clones that were generated from the fusion were then screened for specific anti-SasA antibody production using a standard ELISA assay. Positive clones were expanded and tested further for activity in a whole bacterial cell binding assay by flow cytometry and SasA binding by Biacore analysis. Throughout the
Biacore analysis, the flow rate remained constant at 10 m !/min. Prior to the SasA or
DgsK injection, test antibody was adsorbed to the chip via RAM-Fc binding. At time 0, SasA or DgsK at a concentration of 30 mg/ml was injected over the chip for 3 min followed by 2 minutes of dissociation. This phase of the analysis measured the relative association and disassociation kinetics of the Mab/SasA or DgsK interaction.</p><p> Next, the antibodies prepared as set forth above were tested for binding to whole bacteria. In these tests, bacterial samples S. aureus Newman, S. aureus 67 0, S. aureus 397 (Sal6), S. aureus Wood, S. aureus 8325-4, methicillin resistant S. aureus MRSA 16, S. epidermidis ATCC 35984, S. epidermidis HB, S. epidermidis
CN-899 and S. haemolyticus ATCC 43253 were collected, washed and incubated with Mab or PBS alone (control) at a concentration of 2 pg/ml after blocking with rabbit IgG (50 mg/ml). Following incubation with antibody, bacterial cells were incubated with Goat-F (ab') 2-Anti-Mouse-F (ab') 2-FITC which served as the detection antibody. After antibody labeling, bacterial cells were aspirated through the FACScaliber flow cytometer to analyze fluorescence emission (excitation: 488, emission: 570). For each bacterial strain, 10,000 events were collected and measured. These data indicate that antibodies against S. aureus SasA were able to recognize a homologous protein on the surface of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The data support Western blot analysis demonstrating that rabbit polyclonal antibodies against S. aureus SasA cross-react with a protein released from the cell surface of S. epidermidis HB as well as the recombinant A-region from
DsgK cloned from S. epidermidis (see Figure 6 and Table 3 below).</p><p>Table 3. Polyclonal Sera Reactivity

Labels for use in immunoassays are generally known to those skilled in the art and include enzymes, radioisotopes, and fluorescent, luminescent and chromogenic substances, including colored particles such as colloidal gold or latex beads.</p><p>Suitable immunoassays include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).</p><p> Alternatively, the antibody may be labeled indirectly by reaction with labeled substances that have an affinity for immunoglobulin. The antibody may be conjugated with a second substance and detected with a labeled third substance having an affinity for the second substance conjugated to the antibody. For example, the antibody may be conjugated to biotin and the antibody-biotin conjugate detected using labeled avidin or streptavidin. Similarly, the antibody may be conjugated to a hapten and the antibody-hapten conjugate detected using labeled anti-hapten antibody. These and other methods of labeling antibodies and assay conjugates are well known to those skilled in the art.</p><p> In accordance with the present invention, there are also provided vaccines for either active or passive immunization designed to treat or protect against staphylococcal infections, and these vaccines may be prepared from the surface proteins or their active regions as set forth above using a number of the conventional vaccine preparation methods well known in this field. In the typical vaccine, an immunogenic amount of a suitable surface protein or active fragment thereof is combined with a suitable pharmaceutical acceptable vehicle, carrier or excipient, and an amount of this vaccine effective to immunize a human or animal patient may be administered as appropriate. By immunogenic amount it would be understood by one of ordinary skill in this art that this refers to any amount of the protein or active fragment or subregion thereof which is able to raise an immunogenic response in the human or animal patient.</p><p> In addition to active vaccines wherein antibodies are generated in the patient by virtue of the introduction or administration of an immunogenic amount of a protein or active fragment in accordance with the present invention, the isolated antibodies of the present invention, or active fragments thereof, may also be utilized in the development of vaccines for passive immunization against staph infections. In such a case, the antibody compositions as described above, namely an effective amount of the antibody and a pharmaceutical acceptable vehicle, carrier or excipient, may be administered as appropriate to a human or animal patient.</p><p> Accordingly, in accordance with the invention, the proteins or active fragments thereof may be utilized as active vaccines, and the antibodies of the invention may be used as a passive vaccine which will be useful in providing suitable antibodies to treat or prevent a staphylococcal infection. As would be recognized by one skilled in this art, a vaccine may be packaged for administration in a number of suitable ways, such as by parenteral (i. e., intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous) administration or nasopharyngeal (i. e., intranasal) administration.</p><p>One such mode is where the vaccine is injected intramuscularly, e. g., into the deltoid muscle, however, the particular mode of administration will depend on the nature of the bacterial infection to be dealt with and the condition of the patient.</p><p>The vaccine is preferably combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, carrier or excipient to facilitate administration, and the carrier is usually water or a buffered saline, with or without a preservative. The vaccine may be lyophilized for resuspension at the time of administration or in solution.</p><p> In addition, in certain cases, the antibodies of the present invention may be modified as necessary so that, when necessary, they become less immunogenic in the patient to whom it is administered. For example, if the patient is a human, the antibody may be"humanized"by transplanting the complimentarity determining regions of the hybridoma-derived antibody into a human monoclonal antibody as described, e. g., by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Jones et al., Nature 321: 522-525 (1986)</bibl> or <bibl next="bibl33" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Tempest et a/. Biotechnology 9: 266-273 (1991)</bibl> or"veneered"by changing the surface exposed murine framework residues in the immunoglobulin variable regions to mimic a homologous human framework counterpart as described, e. g., by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Padlan, Molecular
Imm. 28: 489-498 (1991)</bibl>, these references incorporated herein by reference. Even further, when so desired, the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention may be administered in conjunction with a suitable antibiotic to further enhance the ability of the present compositions to fight bacterial infections when necessary.</p><p> In addition to treating human or animal patients, the present compositions may also be used to halt or prevent infection of a medical device or other biomaterials such as an implant. Medical devices or polymeric biomaterials to be coated with the antibodies, proteins and active fragments described herein include, but are not limited to, staples, sutures, replacement heart valves, cardiac assist devices, hard and soft contact lenses, intraocular lens implants (anterior chamber or posterior chamber), other implants such as corneal inlays, kerato-prostheses, vascular stents, epikeratophalia devices, glaucoma shunts, retinal staples, scleral buckles, dental prostheses, thyroplastic devices, laryngoplastic devices, vascular grafts, soft and hard tissue prostheses including, but not limited to, pumps, electrical devices including stimulators and recorders, auditory prostheses, pacemakers, artificial larynx, dental implants, mammary implants, penile implants, cranio/facial tendons, artificial joints, tendons, ligaments, menisci, and disks, artificial bones, artificial organs including artificial pancreas, artificial hearts, artificial limbs, and heart valves ; stents, wires, guide wires, intravenous and central venous catheters, laser and balloon angioplasty devices, vascular and heart devices (tubes, catheters, balloons), ventricular assists, blood dialysis components, blood oxygenators, urethral/ureteral/urinary devices (Foley catheters, stents, tubes and balloons), airway catheters (endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes and cuffs), enteral feeding tubes (including nasogastric, intragastric and jejunal tubes), wound drainage tubes, tubes used to drain the body cavities such as the pleural, peritoneal, cranial, and pericardial cavities, blood bags, test tubes, blood collection tubes, vacutainers, syringes, needles, pipettes, pipette tips, and blood tubing.</p><p> It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the term"coated"or "coating", as used herein, means to apply the antibody or active fragment, or pharmaceutical composition derived therefrom, to a surface of the device, preferably an outer surface that would be exposed to streptococcal bacterial infection. The surface of the device need not be entirely covered by the protein, antibody or active fragment.</p><p> The preferred dose for administration of an antibody composition in accordance with the present invention is that amount will be effective in preventing of treating a staphylococcal infection, and one would readily recognize that this amount will vary greatly depending on the nature of the infection and the condition of a patient. As indicated above, an"effective amount"of antibody or pharmaceutical agent to be used in accordance with the invention is intended to mean a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the agent, such that the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect is produced. As will be pointed out below, the exact amount of the antibody or a particular agent that is required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the condition being treated, the particular carrier or adjuvant being used and its mode of administration, and the like. Accordingly, the"effective amount"of any particular antibody composition will vary based on the particular circumstances, and an appropriate effective amount may be determined in each case of application by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation. The dose should be adjusted to suit the individual to whom the composition is administered and will vary with age, weight and metabolism of the individual. The compositions may also contain stabilizers or pharmaceutical acceptable preservatives, such as thimerosal (ethyl (2-mercaptobenzoate-S) mercury sodium salt) (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO).</p><p> When used with suitable labels or other appropriate detectable biomolecule or chemicals, the monoclonal antibodies described herein are useful for purposes such as in vivo and in vitro diagnosis of staphylococcal infections or detection of staphylococcal bacteria. Laboratory research may also be facilitated through use of such antibodies. Various types of labels and methods of conjugating the labels to the antibodies of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art, such as the ones set forth below.</p><p> For example, the antibody can be conjugated (directly or via chelation) to a radiolabel such as, but not restricted to,"P,'H, 14c, 35s, 1251, or 131 1. Detection of a label can be by methods such as scintillation counting, gamma ray spectrometry or autoradiography. Bioluminescent labels, such as derivatives of firefly luciferin, are also useful. The bioluminescent substance is covalently bound to the protein by conventional methods, and the labeled protein is detected when an enzyme, such as luciferase, catalyzes a reaction with ATP causing the bioluminescent molecule to emit photons of light. Fluorogens may also be used to label proteins. Examples of fluorogens include fluorescein and derivatives, phycoerythrin, allo-phycocyanin, phycocyanin, rhodamine, and Texas Red. The fluorogens are generally detected by a fluorescence detector.</p><p> The location of a ligand in cells can be determined by labeling an antibody as described above and detecting the label in accordance with methods well known to one skilled in the art, such as immunofluorescence microscopy using procedures such as those described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Warren et al. (Mol. Cell. Biol., 7: 1326-1337,1987</bibl>).</p><p> As indicated above, the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention, or active portions or fragments thereof, are particularly useful for interfering with the initial physical interaction between a staphylococcal pathogen responsible for infection and a mammalian host, and this interference with the physical interaction may be useful both in treating patients and in preventing or reducing bacteria infection on in-dwelling medical devices to make them safer for use.</p><p> In another embodiment of the present invention, a kit which may be useful in isolating and identifying staphylococcal bacteria and infection is provided which comprises the antibodies of the present invention in a suitable form, such as lyophilized in a single vessel which then becomes active by addition of an aqueous sample suspected of containing the staphylococcal bacteria. Such a kit will typically include a suitable container for housing the antibodies in a suitable form along with a suitable immunodetection reagent which will allow identification of complexes binding to the surface proteins or the antibodies of the invention. In general, these kits may contain an antibody in accordance with the invention and means to identify binding of that antibody when a sample from a patient is introduced to the antibody.</p><p>For example, a suitable immunodetection reagent may comprise an appropriate detectable signal or label, such as a biotin or enzyme that produces a detectable color, etc., which may be linked to the antibody or utilized in other suitable ways so as to provide a detectable result when the antibody binds to the antigen.</p><p> In short, the antibodies of the present invention which recognize and bind to the surface proteins of the invention, or active fragments thereof, will thus be useful in treating a wide variety of staphylococcal infections in human and animal patients and in medical or other in-dwelling devices. In accordance with the invention, because of the nature of these proteins and the fact that they contain epitopes in common with proteins of the other type of staphylococcal bacteria, i. e., a protein from a coagulase-negative staph will raise antibodies that recognize a homologous protein from S. aureus and vice versa, the antibodies of the invention will exhibit cross-reactivity and should be effective against a broad range of staphylococcal infections. Accordingly, the present invention provides methods and compositions for improved methods of treating or protecting against a wide range of staphylococcal infections.</p><p>EXAMPLES

Isolation and Sequencing of MSCRAMM's from S. Aureus
Staphylococcus aureus is known to express a class of surface-associated proteins which play important roles in pathogenicity by allowing bacteria to avoid host defenses and by acting as adhesins. These proteins are known as MSCRAMMs (Microbial Surface Components Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecules) and in most cases are covalently anchored to the cell wall peptidoglycan. They have several common features: (i) an N-terminal signal peptide (approximately 40 residues in length) required for Sec-dependent secretion, (ii) a wall spanning domain either rich in proline and glycine residues or composed of serine and aspartat dipeptide repeats, (iii) an LPXTG motif required for covalent anchoring of the protein to the pentaglycine crossbridge in peptidoglycan, (iv) a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain followed by (v) several positively charged residues.</p><p> By exploiting the whole genome sequences of S. aureus, eight novel open reading frames encoding proteins with secretion and anchorage motifs indicative of
MSCRAMMs were identified (i. e. bearing an N-terminal signal peptide and a Cterminal LPXTG motif followed by a hydrophobic domain and a positively charged tail). The following Table illustrates the list of proteins identified including their distribution among S. aureus genomes, their protein size and C-terminal cell wall sorting sequence.

Primary structure analysis :
A bioinformatic approach was used for primary structure and function prediction (Figure 1). Proteins RrkN and DsqA possessed a similar structural organization to previously described MSCRAMMs. RrkN is similar in structure to the Pls/Aap proteins of S. aureus and S. epidermidis, respectively. It contains a 200-residue domain at its N-terminus showing 40% identity to Pis and Aap. The C-terminus of the protein is predominantly composed of a 128 residue repeat domain, which varies in the numbers of repeats from strain to strain. These repeats are also present in Pis and Aap. A putative sar homolog and fnbpA and fnbpB lie directly upstream from RrkN on the genome.</p><p>DsqA is similar in structural organization to the Sdr family of proteins. It contains a typical A domain followed by a TYYFTDVK motif which is similar to a conserved
TYTFTVYVD motif found in all of the Sdr proteins. The function of this motif has yet to be determined. Two 88 residue repeat domains reside in the centre of the protein followed by a C-terminal SX-repeat motif similar to the SD-repeat motif found in the
Sdr proteins. The size of this repeat varies from strain to strain. DsqA neighbors secY and secA on the genome. A DsqA homolog ( &gt; 90% identical) is also found in
S. epidermidis.</p><p>KnkA contains no repeat domains in its sequence. Secondary structure prediction analysis indicate that this protein is predominantly composed of alpha-helices.</p><p>RkaS contains no repeat domains in its sequence. BLAST analysis indicates that it is similar to a 5'nucleotidase UDP-sugar hydrolase. The gene encoding RkaS lies directly upstream from oryx, the insertion site of the mec element.</p><p>KesK contains two 140 residue repeat domains at the N-terminus of the protein which are 38% identical. Hydropathy plot analysis (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) indicates that there is a large hydrophilic domain in the center of the protein (residue 500-560).</p><p>EkeS contains two 300 residue repeat domains in the center of the protein which are 38% identical. Blast analysis indicates that the N-terminus of the protein (residues 1-1268, bearing both repeats) is 49% identical to FmtB, an LPXTG protein with 17 tandem repeats. FmtB is proposed to be involved indirectly in methicillin resistance as inactivation of fmt8 abolishes methicillin resistance. This appears to be due to affecting cell wall composition as methicillin sensitivity can be relieved by increasing the production of the cell wall precursor glucosamine-1-phosphate (Komatsuzawa et al., 2000).</p><p>KrkN and KrkN2 neighbor each other on the genome.</p><p>Expression analysis : 
Due to lack of sequence homology with protein databases, a putative function for each of these proteins could not be predicted and hence a molecular approach was taken. Unique regions of four of the orfs were expressed in E. coli as recombinant his-tagged fusion proteins using the Qiagen pQE-30 expression system. Figure 2. represents a Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gel of the purified N-terminal his-tag fusion proteins. The recombinant proteins RrkN1, DsqA2, KesK1 and KnkA were used to generate antibodies in rabbits. Western blotting analysis of S. aureus cell wall extracts revealed that KesK, KnkA and DsqA are expressed and cell wallassociated (Figure 3). Strain eMRSA-16 represents a knkA-negative strain since it lacks the knkA gene. An immunoreactive band of 65kDa reacts with the cell wall fraction from both exponential and stationary phase cells of strain 8325-4 (Figure 3,
B). The absence of this band in strain eMRSA-16 suggests that it represents the gene product of knkA.</p><p>Western immunoblotting of the cell wall fraction of strain 8325-4 using anti-KesK antibodies identified a 150kDa immunoreactive band in both exponential and stationary phase cultures. A similar sized immunoreactive protein released from the cell wall fraction of Lactococcus lactis expressing full length KesK on an expression plasmid (pKS80) suggests that the 150kDa band represents the kesK gene product (data not shown). A kesK knockout mutant in S. aureus would be required to confirm the size of the cell wall-released KesK protein.</p><p>Western immunoblotting of the cell wall fraction of S. aureus strain MSSA and eMRSA-16 using anti-DsqA antibodies identified a 130kDa immunoreactive band.</p><p>Expression levels are higher in stationary phase cells.</p><p> Heterologous expression in Lactococcus lactis :
Heterologous expression of S. aureus surface proteins in Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) has previously been used as a tool to study protein function (Sinha et al., 2000). In this study this surrogate system will be used to express each of the in silico-predicted MSCRAMMs on the surface of L. lattis to fish for a function. KesK and KnkA have been cloned into L. lactis and shown by dot blotting to be surface expressed (Figure 4). No cross reaction was observed with the negative control (pKS80 plasmid without an insert) indicating that this is a specific reaction. Cell wall and protoplast fractions of Lactococcus lactis bearing pKS-KnkA and pKS-KesK were generated by digestion of cells with lysozyme and mutanolysin and used in
Western blotting studies using anti-KnkA and anti-KesK antibodies, respectively.</p><p>Unlike what was observed in S. aureus, KnkA was not detected in the cell wall fraction of L. lactis but found to be associated with the protoplast fraction. The anchoring motif of KnkA differs from the consensus LPXTG sequence in that it contains an Alanine residue instead of a Threonine (i. e. LPKAG) (Table 1). It has been recently been published that S. aureus contains two sortase genes, srtA and srtB (Pallen, 2001). It is possible that this variant form of the LPXTG motif is processed by the second sortase gene, which is absent in L. lactis. This would also explain the slight increase in size of the KnkA protein observed in the protoplast fraction, as the cell wall sorting signal has not been cleaved.</p><p>KesK was detected in the cell wall fraction of L. lactis but migrated at a smaller molecular weight than the KesK protein released from the cell wall of S. aureus.</p><p>The majority of MSCRAMMs expressed on the surface of L. lactis are prone to proteolysis during the cell wall extraction procedure (Louise O'Brien, personal communication). Therefore, it is possible that the KesK protein released from the surface of L. Iactis represents a truncated form of KesK. Shorter digestion times with lysozyme and mutanolysin has been shown to limit the extent of proteolysis.</p><p>Expression of in silico-predicted MSCRAMMs in vivo:
Convalescent-phase sera from 33 patients recovering from S. aureus infections were tested in their ability to recognize the purified N-terminal his-tag fusion proteins in an ELISA assay. Pooled sera from children and healthy blood donors were used as negative controls. A positive reaction was taken as a value equal to or greater than twice the value of the negative control. Figures 5A-5D illustrate that all of the proteins were recognized by 27-42% of the patients suggesting that these proteins are expressed in vivo and are immunogenic during infection of the host.</p><p>References:

Example 2. Isolation and Sequencing of Cross-Reactive Proteins from S.</p><p>Aureus and from Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci
It has been recently shown that S. epidermidis contains surface proteins structurally related to S. aureus MSCRAMM proteins (US 09/386, 962). One protein from S. aureus is of particular interest since it has a close homologue in S. epidermidis. The protein is called DsqA or SasA (S. aureus) and DgsK (S. epidermidis). They are characterized by a typical"A"domain of approximately 500 amino acid residues, followed by two B repeats of 88 residues that are-40% identical and a unique
SXSX dipeptide repeat that can vary in length depending on the strain. Contained within the A domain of the S. aureus DsqA/SasA is a 180 residue region that has ~40% identity to a similar sized domain within region A of S. aureus proteins RrkN,
Pls and S. epidermidis protein Aap The A regions of the DsqA/SasA and DgsK proteins are 46 % identical at the amino acid level, the BB repeats are 50% identical. Active and passive immunization strategies that include ; vaccines, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies recognizing both S. aureus and coagulasenegative staphylococcal proteins are the subject of this invention.</p><p>Specific Examples of Antibodies that Cross-React with Coagulase-Negative

Protein Production and Purification
Using PCR, the A domain of DgsK or SasA was amplified from the sequences described above and subcloned into the E. coli expression vector PQE-30 (Qiagen), which allows for the expression of a recombinant fusion protein containing six histidine residues. This vector was subsequently transformed into the E coli strain
ATCC 55151, grown in a 15-liter fermentor to an optical density (OD600) of 0.7 and induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-1-beta-D galactoside (IPTG) for 4 hours. The cells were harvested using an AG Technologies hollow-fiber assembly (pore size of 0.45 Cm) and the cell paste frozen at-80 C. Cells were lysed in 1X PBS (10 mL of buffer/1 g of cell paste) using 2 passes through the French Press &amp;commat; 1100psi. </p><p>Lysed cells were spun down at 17,000rpm for 30 minutes to remove cell debris.</p><p>Supernatant was passed over a 5-mL HiTrap Cheating (Pharmacia) column charged with 0. 1M NiCI2. fter loading, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of 10mM Tris, pH 8.0,100mM NaCI (Buffer A). Protein was eluted using a 0-100% gradient of 10mM Tris, pH 8.0,100mM NaCI, 200 mM imidazole (Buffer B) over 30 column volumes. SdrGN1N2N3 or SdrGN2N3 eluted at-13% Buffer B (-26mM imidazole). Absorbance at 280nm was monitored. Fractions containing
SdrGN1 N2N3 or SdrGN2N3 were dialyzed in 1x PBS.</p><p>Each protein was then put through an endotoxin removal protocol. Buffers used during this protocol were made endotoxin free by passing over a 5-mL Mono-Q sepharose (Pharmacia) column. Protein was divided evenly between 4x 15mL tubes. The volume of each tube was brought to 9mL with Buffer A. 1mL of 10%
Triton X-114 was added to each tube and incubated with rotation for 1 hour at 4 C. </p><p>Tubes were placed in a 37 C water bath to separate phases. Tubes were spun down at 2,000rpm for 10 minutes and the upper aqueous phase from each tube was collected and the detergent extraction repeated. Aqueous phases from the 2nd extraction were combined and passed over a 5-mL IDA cheating (Sigma) column, charged with 0.1M NiCI2 to remove remaining detergent. The column was washed with 9 column volumes of Buffer A before the protein was eluted with 3 column volumes of Buffer B. The eluant was passed over a 5-mL Detoxigel (Sigma) column and the flow-through collected and reapplied to the column. The flowthrough from the second pass was collected and dialyzed in 1x PBS. The purified product was analyzed for concentration, purity and endotoxin level before administration into the mice.</p><p>Monoclonal Antibody Production
E coli expressed and purified recombinant SasA and DsgK proteins were used to generate a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies while the mouse sera was used as a source of polyclonal antibodies. Briefly, a group of Ba ! b/C or SJL mice received a series of subcutaneous immunizations of 1-10 mg of protein in solution or mixed with adjuvant as described in the Table below.</p><p>Immunization Schemes

At the time of sacrifice (RIMMS) or seven days after a boost (conventional) serum was collected and titered in ELISA assays against MSCRAMM proteins or on whole cells (S. epidermidis and S. aureus). Three days after the final boost, the spleens or lymph nodes were removed, teased into a single cell suspension and the lymphocytes harvested. The lymphocytes were then fused to a P3X63Ag8.653 myeloma cell line (ATCC &amp;num;CRL-1580). Cell fusion, subsequent plating and feeding were performed according to the Production of Monoclonal Antibodies protocol from
Current Protocols in Immunology (Chapter 2, Unit 2.).</p><p>Any clones that were generated from the fusion were then screened for specific anti-SasA antibody production using a standard ELISA assay. Positive clones were expanded and tested further for activity in a whole bacterial cell binding assay by flow cytometry and SasA binding by Biacore analysis.</p><p>Biacore Analysis
Throughout the analysis, the flow rate remained constant at 10 ml/min. Prior to the
SasA or DgsK injection, test antibody was adsorbed to the chip via RAM-Fc binding.</p><p>At time 0, SasA or DgsK at a concentration of 30 mg/ml was injected over the chip for 3 min followed by 2 minutes of dissociation. This phase of the analysis measured the relative association and disassociation kinetics of the Mab/SasA or
DgsK interaction.</p><p>Binding to Whole Bacteria
Bacterial samples S. aureus Newman, S. aureus 67-0, S. aureus 397 (Sal6), S. aureus Wood, S. aureus 8325-4, methicillin resistant S. aureus MRSA 16, S. epidermidis ATCC 35984, S. epidermidis HB, S. epidermidis CN-899 and S. haemolyticus ATCC 43253 were collected, washed and incubated with Mab or PBS alone (control) at a concentration of 2 ug/ml after blocking with rabbit IgG (50 mg/ml). Following incubation with antibody, bacterial cells were incubated with Goat-F (ab') 2-Anti-Mouse-F (ab') 2-FITC which served as the detection antibody. After antibody labeling, bacterial cells were aspirated through the FACScaliber flow cytometer to analyze fluorescence emission (excitation: 488, emission: 570). For each bacterial strain, 10,000 events were collected and measured. These data indicate that antibodies against S. aureus SasA were able to recognize a homologous protein on the surface of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The data support Western blot analysis demonstrating that rabbit polyclonal antibodies against S. aureus SasA cross-react with a protein released from the cell surface of
S. epidermidis HB as well as the recombinant A-region from DsgK cloned from S. epidermidis (see Table below and Figure 6).</p><p>Polyclonal Sera Reactivity
