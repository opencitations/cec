Even more particularly, the invention relates to a coupling assembly that is mounted or connected to the three point hitch assembly of a tractor or similar equipment and which receives and retains an implement having three triangularly disposed pins in the standard three point pattern. </p><p num="p-0003"> The three point tractor hitch assembly is a well known mechanism for connecting an implement to a tractor or similar vehicle. In general, a typical three point hitch assembly comprises an upper arm and two lower hitch arms, each having a hook to receive the pins of an implement, which are dispersed in the standard triangular pattern. Most known three point hitch assemblies are not fully automatic and require the operator to manually manipulate components, usually from the ground. Known systems are also susceptible to the implement becoming loose or dislodged during use. Examples of various types of three point hitch and similar implement mounting systems can be seen in <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 6,478,094</ref> to Alexander et al., <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat.

It is an object to provide a three point mounting hitch assembly that does not require manual manipulation of the hitch components. It is an object to provide such an assembly that can be mounted onto standard tractor three point hitch assemblies. It is an object to provide such an assembly that provides a means to properly locate the upper and lower hooks relative to the implement pins using electric or hydraulic means. It is an object to provide such an assembly that allows the lower hooks to be spread and contracted horizontally relative to each other, and for the lower hooks to be spread or contracted vertically relative to the upper hook. It is an object to provide such an assembly that extends the lower hooks in a generally vertical yet slanted direction, such that the implement pins are wedged upon vertical retraction of the lower pins. It is an object to provide such an assembly wherein the lower hooks are spread horizontally simultaneously, and where the lower hooks are raised and lowered independently. Additional objects not expressly stated above will be apparent upon review of the disclosure to follow. </p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading><p num="p-0005"> The invention is in general a coupling assembly for connection to or combination with a tractor three point mounting hitch assembly to receive and retain an implement having an upper pin and two lower pins disposed in the standard three point hitch pattern, wherein the coupling assembly connects to the lower hitch arms and upper mounting bracket of a tractor. The coupling assembly comprises a pair of opposing and telescoping lateral extension arms received by a central cross sleeve member disposed generally horizontally. Two generally vertical extension legs are telescopically received by two generally vertical sleeve members, with each such set being connected to one of the lateral extension arms. Means to extend and retract the lateral extension arms and means to extend and retract the vertical extension legs are provided, and preferably comprise electrical actuators operating piston rods. An upper arm assembly joins the cross sleeve member to the tractor upper mounting bracket, and means to lengthen and shorten the upper arm assembly is provided. An upper hook to receive and retain the upper pin of the implement is mounted to the cross sleeve member and a lower hook to receive and retain the lower pins of the implement is mounted on each leg extension. </p> <p num="p-0006"> In this manner, the vertical spread distance between the upper hook and the lower hooks can be increased or decreased, and the horizontal spread distance between the two lower hooks can be increased or decreased. The lateral extension arms are moved simultaneously, while the leg extensions may be moved independently. Means to lock in position the leg extensions and the lateral extension arms are provided. Preferably, electric actuators are used to operate the leg extensions and the lateral extension arms, while a hydraulic cylinder is used to operate the upper arm assembly. </p> <p num="p-0007"> The coupling assembly allows the tractor operator to attach an implement by lowering the upper hook onto the implement upper pin, retracting the lateral extension arms to properly locate the lower hooks under the implement lower pins, then raising the extension legs to secure the lower pins. Preferably, the extension legs are non-parallel and inclined inwardly such that there is a greater distance between their lower ends than their upper ends. Through this construction, the implement pins are wedged laterally as the extension legs are raised, thereby further securing the implement from being loosened or dislodged during use. </p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading> <p num="p-0008"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of the invention showing the three point mounting hitch assembly of a tractor, the coupling assembly and a portion of an implement as mounted on the coupling assembly and tractor. </p><p num="p-0009"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a top view of the coupling assembly. </p><p num="p-0010"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a rear view of the coupling assembly showing the generally horizontal assembly comprising the cross sleeve member and lateral extension arms, and the generally vertical assembly comprising the vertical sleeve members, vertical extension legs and lower hook members, shown connected to the tractor lower hitch arm. </p><p num="p-0011"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side view of the coupling assembly showing the generally vertical assembly comprising the vertical sleeve members, vertical extension legs and lower hook members, as well as the upper hook member, shown connected to the tractor lower hitch arm. </p><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading><p num="p-0012"> With reference to the drawings, the invention will now be described in detail with regard for the best mode and the preferred embodiment. In general, the invention is a three point tractor hitch apparatus for coupling implements to the rear of a tractor, but it is to be understood that three point mounting hitch assemblies are also utilized with other types of equipment and the coupling assembly as described herein is applicable in those situations as well. The apparatus allows the tractor operator to quickly and easily couple the implement to the tractor without having to dismount from the tractor. The apparatus is suitable for use with various implements having different heights and widths at a three point coupling configuration, and is particularly suited for use with Category 1 and Category 2 implements. A three point coupling for an implement <b>91</b> comprises a centrally located upper pin or top link <b>93</b> and a pair of lower pins or bottom links <b>94</b> mounted on a frame or mast <b>92</b>, such that the links <b>93</b> and <b>94</b> are accessible to the upper hook <b>42</b> and lower hooks <b>53</b> and <b>63</b> of the three point hitch apparatus mounted onto the tractor. </p><p num="p-0013"> A typical three point tractor hitch assembly comprises a pair of lower arm assemblies <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>. The lower arm assemblies <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> comprise lower hitch arms <b>21</b> and <b>31</b> that are pivotally connected to the tractor, preferably through a ball joint connection. The lower hitch arms <b>21</b> and <b>31</b> are retained by link arms <b>22</b> and <b>32</b> that are pivotally connected to each lower hitch arm <b>21</b> and <b>31</b>, respectively. The upper end of the link arms <b>22</b> and <b>32</b> are connected by link arm ball joints <b>23</b> and <b>33</b>, respectively, to link arm mounts <b>25</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Hitch arm ball joints <b>24</b> and <b>34</b> connect the distal ends of the lower hitch arms <b>21</b> and <b>31</b>, respectively, to mounting brackets <b>55</b> and <b>65</b> on the vertical extension legs <b>52</b> and <b>62</b>. In this manner, limited independent vertical and horizontal movement of the distal ends of the lower hitch arms <b>21</b> and <b>31</b> is allowed, such that the lower hitch arms <b>21</b> and <b>31</b> can be raised, lowered spread apart or brought closer together. </p><p num="p-0014"> The invention is a coupling assembly <b>40</b> and comprises an upper arm assembly <b>10</b> comprising an upper hitch arm <b>11</b> pivotally attached to an upper arm mounting means such as a standard hitch arm mounting bracket <b>12</b> affixed to the tractor in a manner that allows the upper hitch arm <b>11</b> to pivot in the vertical direction. An upper arm hydraulic cylinder <b>13</b>, or alternatively a pneumatic cylinder, a mechanical drive mechanism or any other equivalent means to lengthen and shorten the upper arm assembly <b>10</b>, is pivotally connected to the upper hitch arm <b>11</b> in a manner that allows the upper arm hydraulic cylinder <b>13</b> to pivot laterally. Extending from the upper arm hydraulic cylinder <b>13</b> is the upper arm hydraulic cylinder rod <b>14</b> that upon actuation is extended out from and retracted into the hydraulic cylinder <b>13</b>. An upper arm ball joint <b>15</b> is disposed on the distal end of the rod <b>14</b> for connecting the upper arm assembly <b>10</b> to the cross sleeve member <b>41</b> of the coupling assembly <b>40</b>. Most preferably, the upper arm hydraulic cylinder <b>13</b> is provided with a hydraulic locking valve <b>71</b> that permits the cylinder <b>13</b> to be locked in a desired position such that the rod <b>14</b> will not be pulled or pushed by outside stresses during implement use. </p><p num="p-0015"> The coupling assembly <b>40</b> is mounted to the tractor upper arm mounting means <b>12</b> and the lower arm assemblies <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>, such that the implement <b>91</b> is connected to the coupling assembly <b>40</b> rather than directly to the tractor three point mounting hitch. The coupling assembly <b>40</b> is a means to vary the relative positions of the upper hook <b>42</b> and lower hooks <b>53</b> and <b>63</b>, such that the vertical spread distance between the upper hook <b>42</b> and the lower hooks <b>53</b> and <b>63</b> can be changed, and such that the horizontal spread distance between the lower hooks <b>53</b> and <b>63</b> themselves can be changed. The coupling assembly <b>40</b> is composed primarily of tube steel, angle iron and like material such that a strong, rigid and durable assembly is created. </p><p num="p-0016"> In general, in addition to the upper arm assembly <b>10</b>, the coupling assembly <b>40</b> comprises a generally horizontal assembly and a pair of generally vertical, but preferably slightly slanted, assemblies. The generally horizontal assembly comprises a cross sleeve <b>41</b> to which is mounted an upper hook <b>42</b> having a downwardly oriented slot <b>43</b> to receive the upper pin <b>93</b> of the implement <b>91</b>. Cross sleeve <b>41</b> receives in telescoping manner a pair of opposing lateral extension arms <b>45</b>, such that the lateral extension arms <b>45</b> can be extended from the cross sleeve <b>41</b> to lengthen the overall width dimension or retracted into cross sleeve <b>41</b> to shorten the overall width dimension. A centrally located mounting bracket <b>44</b> is provided on cross sleeve <b>41</b> to receive the upper arm ball joint <b>15</b> of upper arm assembly <b>10</b>, which is secured by pin <b>46</b>. </p><p num="p-0017"> The generally vertical assemblies comprise a vertical sleeve <b>51</b> connected to outer end of one lateral extension arm <b>45</b> and a vertical sleeve <b>61</b> connected to the outer end of the other lateral extension arm <b>45</b>. Although the vertical sleeves <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> may be parallel, preferably vertical sleeves <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> are disposed in non-parallel manner to each other, most preferably at approximately 10 to 15 degrees from vertical, such that the vertical sleeves <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> slant inwardly toward each other such that the distance between the upper ends of the vertical sleeves <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> is less than the distance between the lower ends. Each vertical sleeve <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> receives in telescoping meaner a vertical extension leg <b>52</b> and <b>62</b>, respectively, such that the height dimension can be lengthened by extending the extension legs <b>52</b> and <b>62</b> from the vertical sleeves <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> or can be shortened by retracting the extension legs <b>52</b> and <b>62</b>. Lower hook members <b>53</b> and <b>63</b>, each having an upwardly oriented slot <b>54</b> and <b>64</b> are mounted on the lower ends of the extension legs <b>52</b> and <b>62</b>, respectively. Mounting brackets <b>55</b> and <b>65</b> are provided on the lower ends of the extension legs <b>52</b> and <b>62</b>, respectively, to receive the hitch arm ball joints <b>24</b> and <b>34</b> of the lower hitch arms <b>21</b> and <b>31</b>, which are held in place by pins <b>56</b> and <b>66</b>, respectively. </p><p num="p-0018"> Means to simultaneously extend and retract the lateral extension arms <b>45</b> relative to the cross sleeve <b>41</b> and means to independently extend and retract the extension legs <b>52</b> and <b>62</b> relative to the vertical sleeves <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> are provided. Preferably, these means are hydraulic or electric actuators, but similar means such as pneumatic cylinders or the like may be utilized. As shown, preferably a dual piston cylinder <b>47</b> operated by an electrical actuator <b>49</b> is mounted within the cross sleeve <b>41</b>, such that a pair of rods <b>48</b> are operated by the cylinder <b>47</b> to extend or retract the lateral extension arms <b>45</b> in unison. Electrical actuators <b>57</b> and <b>67</b> are mounted to vertical sleeves <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> to operate rods <b>58</b> and <b>68</b> to extend and retract the extension legs <b>52</b> and <b>62</b>, respectively. </p><p num="p-0019"> Operation of the upper arm hitch cylinder <b>13</b>, the cross sleeve cylinder <b>47</b> and the vertical sleeve actuators <b>57</b> and <b>67</b> is controlled by suitable electrical and hydraulic conduits and connectors that terminate in a control housing located within reach of the tractor operator. </p><p num="p-0020"> Preferably, the electrical system controlling the actuators <b>49</b>, <b>57</b> and <b>67</b> is provided with a means to lock the actuators <b>49</b>, <b>57</b> and <b>67</b> in a desired position, such as by grounding the system through a locking switch in the control housing, such that the position of the lateral extension arms <b>45</b> and the vertical extension legs <b>53</b> and <b>63</b> can be secured during use. In addition, locking screws <b>72</b> or similar means may be provided on the cross sleeve <b>41</b> and the vertical sleeves <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> as a back-up securing sytem, such that the position of the lateral extension arms <b>45</b> and the vertical extension legs <b>53</b> and <b>63</b> can be further secured during use. </p><p num="p-0021"> To use the invention, the tractor operator initiates the actuator <b>49</b> to spread the lateral extension arms <b>45</b> and the actuators <b>57</b> and <b>67</b> to extend the vertical extension legs <b>52</b> and <b>62</b>. The tractor is then positioned such that the upper hook <b>42</b> is centered above the upper pin <b>93</b> of the implement <b>91</b>. The coupling assembly <b>40</b> is properly angled relative to the implement by operating the upper arm hydraulic cylinder <b>13</b>. The upper hook <b>42</b> is then lowered onto the upper pin <b>93</b> such that the slot <b>43</b> receives the upper pin <b>93</b>. The lower hooks <b>53</b> and <b>63</b> are then brought inward so as to be positioned below the lower pins <b>94</b> of the implement <b>91</b> by retracting the lateral extension arms <b>45</b>. Finally, the extension legs <b>52</b> and <b>62</b> are retracted to secure the implement lower pins <b>94</b> in the slots <b>54</b> and <b>64</b> of the lower hooks <b>53</b> and <b>63</b>. In the preferred embodiment wherein the vertical sleeves <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> and the extension legs <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> angle inward, this final operation serves to wedge the pins <b>93</b> and <b>94</b> of the implement <b>91</b> in a secure manner to better retain the implement <b>91</b> during use. The hydraulic locking valve <b>71</b> and electric actuators <b>49</b>, <b>57</b> and <b>67</b> are locked, and the implement <b>91</b> is now securely hitched to the tractor. Release of the implement <b>91</b> is accomplished by reversing the steps. At no time does the tractor operator have to dismount or manually adjust any of the elements of the three point hitch assembly, except where it is further desirable to utilize the locking screws <b>72</b>. </p><p num="p-0022"> Alternatively, the upper hook <b>42</b> may face upwards and the lower hooks <b>53</b> and <b>63</b> may face downward, in which case the upper arm assembly <b>10</b> is used to raise the upper hook <b>42</b> and the lower hooks <b>53</b> and <b>63</b> are extended to secure the implement <b>91</b>. In this embodiment, the angle of the vertical sleeve members <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> and the extension legs <b>52</b> and <b>62</b> may be reversed such that the distance between the bottom ends is less than between the upper ends. </p><p num="p-0023"> Where the implement <b>91</b> is to be coupled to the tractor on uneven terrain, or if the pins <b>93</b> and <b>94</b> of the implement <b>91</b> are not properly spaced, either of the lower hooks <b>53</b> and <b>63</b> can be independently moved in the vertical direction and/or the coupling assembly <b>40</b> can be rotated by manipulating the lower arm assemblies <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> in order to achieve proper alignment with the implement pins <b>93</b> and <b>94</b>. For use with standard implements, a lateral spread between the lower hooks <b>53</b> and <b>63</b> of approximately 21 to 35 inches and a vertical spread of approximately 19 to 31 inches between the upper hook <b>42</b> and the lower hooks <b>53</b> and <b>63</b> has been found suitable. </p><p num="p-0024"> It is understood that equivalents and substitutions to certain elements described above may be obvious to those skilled in the art, and therefore the true scope and definition of the invention is to be as et forth in the following claims. </p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
