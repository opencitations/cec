 AND MILK FAT GLOBULE MEMBRANE COMPONENTS 
This invention relates to an infant formula with probiotics and Milk Fat Globule Membranes components (MFGM) and /or bioactive proteins. 
Mother's milk is recommended for all infants. However, in some cases breast feeding is inadequate or unsuccessful for medical reasons or the mother chooses not to breast feed. Infant formulas have been developed for these situations. 
In the recent past, certain strains of bacteria have attracted considerable attention because they have been found to exhibit valuable properties for man if ingested. In particular, specific strains of the genera Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria have been found to be able to colonize the intestinal mucosa, to reduce the capability of pathogenic bacteria to adhere to the intestinal epithelium, to have immunomodulatory effects and to assist in the maintenance of well-being. Such bacteria are called probiotics. 
Extensive stud ies have been carried out to identify new probiotic strains. For exam ple, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">E P 0 1 99 535</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">E P 0 768 375</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 97/00078</bibl> , <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">EP 0 577 903</bibl> and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 00/53200</bibl> disclose specific strains of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria and their beneficial effects. 
Immediately before birth, the gastro-intestinal tract of a baby is thought to be sterile. During the process of birth, it encounters bacteria from the digestive and genital tracts and skin of the mother and starts to become colonized. Post-natal colonization of the gastro-intestinal tract with commensal bacteria provides bacterial stimuli that are crucial for the functional development of the major compartments of the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) comprising Peyer's patches (T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells), lamina propria (T cells, IgA plasma B cells, dendritic cells, mast cells) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (natural killer cells, T cells). This process is in large part responsible for the sentinel capacity of gut immune cells to distinguish harmless and danger signals and as a consequence establish tolerance or immunity. Large differences exist with respect to the composition of the gut microbiota in response to the infant's feeding . The fecal flora of breast-fed infants includes appreciable populations of Bifidobacteria with some Lactobacillus species, whereas formula-fed infants have more complex microbiota, with Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, Clostridia and Streptococci all usually present. 
For this and other reasons, it has been proposed to add probiotics to infant formulas. Specific probiotic strains have been shown to stimulate immune defense mechanisms, antagonize pathogenic bacteria, promote a healthy microbiota, and down-regulate immune-related disorders such as allergies or inflammation in animals and humans. The abil ity of specific probiotic bacterial strains to modulate the components of the intestinal microbiota of the host is one mechanism by which they affect the immune system. In addition, a direct interaction with the mucosal immune system to stimulate the generation of immune-regulating cytokines has also been postulated and is further supported by recent findings of possible direct sampling of luminal bacteria by dendritic cells that extend dendrites across the intestinal epithelium. More recently, Benyacoub et al. have demonstrated that early life supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus CGMCC 1 .3724 is able to promote mucosal immune defenses and increase response to systemic vaccine in a neonatal mouse model <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(J Benyacoub, A Zuercher, R Bibiloni, K-Y Saudan, P Serrant, G Reuteler, I Rochat, I Segura-Roggero, F Foata, K Deiser, K Vidal, F Rochat, S Blum.

Other recent advances in research suggest that human breast milk contains a low dose of bacteria and/or bacterial fractions, naturally originating from the mother's gut, that seem to be transmitted to the infant (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Pablo F.

For the benefit of infants that will not be completely breast fed, there is a continuing need to develop infant formulas which will replicate human milk as close as possible, both in terms of its nutritional and its bioactive properties. Summary of the Invention

The invention also relates to a composition for educating the immune system, promoting immune maturation, promoting immune maturation, and for treating or preventing a range of physio-pathological conditions such as treating or preventing inflammation, treating or preventing infections, treating or preventing dysregulated gut barrier function, improving gut comfort or combination thereof. The invention is more particularly suitable for use in infants, pre-term infants, babies or individuals in needs.

 "individual in need" means any infant, baby, child , adolescent or adult having particu lar physiolog ical needs in regard to the physio-pathological conditions considered and for which the proposed invention offers an improved or alternative solution. This includes patients of all ages suffering from such physio-pathological conditions. 
 "prebiotic" means a non-digestible food ingredient that beneficially affects the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the colon and thus improves host health (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gibson and Roberfroid "Dietary Modulation of the Human Colonic Microbiota: Introducing the Concept of Prebiotics" J. Nutr 125:1401 - 1412</bibl>). 
 "probiotic" means, in the context of bacterial strains, microbial cell preparations or components of microbial cells with a beneficial effect on the health or well-being of the host. (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Salminen S, Ouwehand A. Benno Y. et al "Probiotics: how should they be defined" Trend Food Sci. Technol. 1999:10 107-10</bibl>); 
 "the first few weeks of the life of an infant" means the period up to the end of the second month of life of the infant. 
 "Milk Fat Globule Membrane (MFGM)" are fatty fractions of milk (in particular cow milk or human milk) as described and defined in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nutritional and technological aspects of milk fat globule membrane material , International Dairy Journal 18 (2008) 436- 457, K. Dewettinck et al</bibl> . In short, the term encompasses the membrane and membrane-associated materials that surround fat globules in mammal ian milk, together with the other components of MFGM, referred to as "MFGM components". For ease of language in the present document, the terms "MFGM" and "MFGM components" are used interchangeably. 
The present inventors recently observed that bacteria in human milk are associated inter alia with the cream fraction of the mil k. Th is d iscovery prompted further investigations into the association of bacteria and lipid as well as protein components in human milk and the effects of this association leading to the present invention. 
In one em bod iment the present invention provides a nutritional composition comprising a probiotic bacterial strain in an amount equivalent to from 10&lt;3&gt; to 10&lt;12&gt; cfu/g of dry formula and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) in an amount of from 0.01 g to 0.1 g for 100g of liquid composition or formula, preferably from 0.03 to 0.1 g for 100g of liquid composition or formula, and/or from 0.01 g to 0.8 g for 1 00g of dry composition or formula, preferably from 0.1 to 0.5g for 1 00g of dry composition or formula. In one embod iment the composition comprises M FGM in an amount of between 0.1 % and 1 0% w/w of total proteins, preferably between 0.5% and 5%. In one embodiment the nutritional composition comprises MFGM in an amount between 0.01 g and 7g of MFGM per 100g of composition (w/w). In one embodiment the invention MFGM originates from bovine, buffalo, horse, goat and/or human milk. 
 The Human milk fat globule membrane protein composition is still largely unknown, although it counts for 2-4% of the total milk protein content (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Stephania Quaranta et al . Human proteome en hancement: H igh-recovery method and improved two dimensional map of colostral fat globule membrane proteins. Electrophoresis 2001 , 22, 1 81 0-1818</bibl>). The invention encompasses an amount of Human milk fat globule membrane ranging from 0.1 % to 1 0% of the total protein of the com position or formula, preferably from 0.5% to 2% of the total protein of the composition or formula The invention also extends to the use of a probiotic bacterial strain and m il k fat globule membrane in the manufacture of a nutritional composition for promoting the maturation of the immune system of a neonatal infant in the first few weeks of life. 
The invention further extends to the use of a probiotic bacterial strain and milk fat globule membrane in the manufacture of a nutritional composition for the prevention or treatment of pathogenic infections in a neonatal infant in the first few weeks of life. 
In a further aspect, the invention extends to a method for promoting the maturation of the immune system of a neonatal infant in need thereof in the first few weeks of life. The method comprises administering to the infant a therapeutic a mou nt of a nutritional composition comprising a probiotic bacteria and milk fat globule membrane. In a yet further aspect, the invention extends to a method for the prevention or treatment of pathogenic infections in a neonatal infant in need thereof in the first few weeks of life. It comprises administering to the infant a therapeutic amount of a nutritional composition com prising a probiotic bacteria and m il k fat globu le membrane. 
In mammalian milk, the fat phase generally accounts for around 40g/L and is mainly composed of triglycerides (96% of total fat), diglycerides (2% of total fat), and complex lipids (1 % of total fat). Triglycerides synthesized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the mammary alveolar cell coalesce into large droplets which migrate to the apical plasma membrane of the cell. The lipid droplets then push against and progressively become enveloped in the membrane of the mammary gland epithelial cells. These membranes, budded off around the m il k l ipids as they are being secreted by the cells, are named the milk fat globule membranes. The Milk fat globule membrane contains specific glycoproteins such as lactoferrin, mucins, lactadherin and xanth ine oxidase as wel l as com plex polar l i pids such as glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Many of these components are present in human milk in much higher concentrations than in bovine milk. 
The first interaction of probiotics with the host occurs at the level of the gut mucosa. Probiotics have been widely demonstrated to protect the host against infections and potentially improve specific disease outcomes. Among the key criteria often used for probiotic strain selection is their capacity to adhere to the intestinal mucosa. This appears to be important for blocking pathogen adherence in vitro and for modulating protective immune functions. 
In studies examining the interaction of bovine mil k fat globule membrane with intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) in vitro, the present inventors disrupted the milk fat globule membrane. Although bacteria were not directly detected in fractions of intact membranes, the disrupt ion of th e m e m bra n es by u l tra-sound resulted in contamination of the IEC cultures. The bacteria appeared to come from the MFGM and not from the I EC cultures. In support of th is, electron micrographs of bovine MFGM reveal the presence of bacterial cocci in chains (see figure 3). Without wishing to be bound by theory, the present inventors believe that bacteria binding to, or encapsulation of bacteria and/or their components within, the milk fat globule membrane may facil itate transport of the m icrobial components through the gastrointestinal system, ensure their del ivery to appropriate sites in the mucosal tissues of the suckling neonate and, together with other factors in the milk fat globule membrane, modulate immunological processes. It is hypothesized that the association of MFGM and probiotics leads to potentiation (synergy) of the beneficial effects seen using probiotics or milk fat globule membrane alone. 
The present invention reveals immune modulating properties of MFGM in association with probiotics that are beyond what cou ld be ach ieved us ing the ind ivid ual ingredients alone. Previous studies have shown that while probiotics and prebiotics are both recogn ised to have beneficial effects on health , their protective effects aga inst d iarrhoea in infants are lost when the two ing red ients are com bi ned (Chouraqui et al. 2007). Thus, the cooperation and/or synergy between the probiotic and MFGM observed in the present invention could not have been predicted. 
The present invention reports that the combination of probiotics with MFGM on the one hand may l im it some pro-inflammatory signals and as such, may l imit tissue da mage but on th e other h and en han ces m ucosa l protection by i ncreasi ng prod uction of secretory IgA by intestinal cel ls . Th is suggests that combining probiotics with MFGM leads to a physiolog ical synergy by promoting distinct but complementary mechanisms which together provide an improved protection of the host. Furthermore, co-administration of probiotics and MFGM may impact biological responses in different tissue sites or in different cell types from those targeted by the individual components. For example, through their co-administration, the survival of live probiotics during intestinal transit as well as the homing of probiotics and/or their attachment to specific intestinal sites may be improved. 
The present invention extends the use of MFGM and probiotics to further aspects of gut barrier maturation such as immune maturation . Furthermore, since the coadministration of probiotics and MFGM may also influence anti-inflammatory processes, the present invention extends to their combined use not only in infants but in at-risk populations irrespective of age. As such, it may not be necessary that a product containing such ingredients be the sole source of nutrition during the period of administration 
Mechanistically it can be hypothesized, for example, that MFGM is a significant source of lipids to the infant and that certain bacteria may increase the expression of molecules involved in lipid absorption. It follows that it should be possible to produce similar beneficial effects in formula-fed infants by supplementing the formula with probiotics and milk fat globule membrane. The probiotics can be pre-blended with MFGM before addition to the composition or the two preparations (probiotics, MFGM) can be added separately to the composition of the invention. 
Preferably, the nutritional composition of the invention is an infant formula. The composition can be a children's food, liquid, semi-liquid or solid, especially for children between 0 and 7 years, or between 0 and 3 years. The composition can be a baby cereal. The composition of the invention can also be targeted to adolescent and adults suffering from particular physio-pathological conditions, especially those in need and/or having compromised gastro-intestinal systems and/or compromised immune / defense systems. 
The probiotic is present in the formula in an amount equivalent to between 10&lt;3&gt; and 10&lt;12&gt; cfu/g of dry composition. The bacteria may be used live, inactivated or dead or even be present as fragments such as DNA or cell wall materials. In other words, the quantity of bacteria wh ich the formula contains is expressed in terms of the equivalent colony forming units of bacteria irrespective of whether they are, all or partly, live, inactivated, dead or fragmented Preferably the probiotic is present in an amount equivalent to between 10&lt;7&gt; to 10&lt;12&gt; cfu/ g of dry composition. 
The probiotic bacterial strain may be any lactic acid bacteria or Bifidobacteria with established probiotic characteristics. The probiotic of the invention may be any probiotic bacterium or probiotic microorganism ("probiotics"), especially of human origin, in particular probiotics that have been or can be originated from, found in, extracted or isolated from milk upon excretion, preferably in human breast milk. Suitable probiotic lactic acid bacteria include Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 obtainable inter alia from Va l io Oy of F i n l a nd u nd er th e trad e m a rk LG G , Lactobacillus rhamnosus CGMCC 1 .3724, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 and Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 obtainable from Biogaia, Lactobacillus fermentum VRI 003 and Lactobacillus paracasei CNCM 1-21 16, Lactobacillus johnsonii CNCM I- 1225, Lactobacillus helveticus CNCM I-4095, Bifidobacterium breve CNCM I-3865, Bifidobacterium longum CNCM 1-2618 
Suitable probiotic Bifidobacteria strains include Bifidobacterium longum ATCC BAA- 999 sold by Morinaga Milk Industry Co. Ltd . of Japan under the trade mark BB536, the strain of Bifidobacterium breve sold by Danisco under the trade mark Bb-03, the strain of Bifidobacterium breve sold by Morinaga under the trade mark M-16V and the strain of Bifidobacterium breve sold by Institut Rosell (Lallemand) under the trade mark R0070. A particularly preferred Bifidobacterium strain is Bifidobacterium lactis CNCM I-3446 which may be obtained from the Christian Hansen Company of Denmark under the trade mark Bb1 2. A m ixture of su itable probiotic lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacteria may be used. 
A variety of ingredients enriched in MFGM are commercially available. MFGM can be present in cream, buttermilk and whole milk. For product development use, buttermilk fractions are the source most often used due to their relatively high concentration of MFGM components. Examples of commercially available buttermilk products include butterm il k (product code 26048) from Land O'Lakes, Inc. M N, buttermilk protein concentrate fractions from Fonterra Cooperative Group (Auckland, New Zealand); a phospholipid-rich fraction derived from MFGM from the Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. (Auckland, New Zealand); buttermilk from Bullinger Butterei (Bullingen, Belgium), Foster Farms Dairy (Modesto, California), Dairy America Inc. (Fresno, California), Dairy Farmers of America (Kansas City, MO); First Milk Ingredients Limited, Paisley, UK and Laban Up products of Gulf &amp; Safa Dairies, United Arab Emirates. However, whey prote in fraction s en riched i n M FG M a re al so com m ercia l ly ava i l able . Examples include LACPRODAN (R) MFGM-10, a whey protein fraction enriched in M FGM produced by Aria Food Ingredients amba, Denmark. Other examples of material may include Promilk 602 E from Ingredia Lacto prosperity AG (Ingredia SA , Arras France), and from any suppl iers containing MFGM (at least 1 .5% of M FGM components; in order to be able to adjust the amount of MFGM to total protein). Depending on the whey protein casein ratio (50/50, 70/30) in the infant formula, one source of MFGM casein based or milk based such as butter milk or Promilk 602E can be mixed in respect with this ratio with a whey protein. The MFGM can comprise proteins, gangliosides and/or phospholipids or combination thereof. 
The MFGM may originate from butter milk , butter milk fractions, defatted butter milk, delactosylated butterm il k, butterm il k fraction obtained by m icrofiltration , or ultrafiltration, fractions recovered from whey protein concentrate, sweet whey, acid whey, whey cream or fat associated fraction from whey containing phospholipids; and/or wherein said MFGM comprises sphingomyelin, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidylchol ine, phosphatidyl inositol , phosphatidyl serine, Cholesterol , gangliosides, Mucinl (MUC 1 ), Xantine-oxidase/dehydrogenase, Periodicacid Schiff (PAS III), CD36, Butyrophilin(BTN), ,Adipophilin(ADPH), PAS 6/7, Fatty-acid binding protein (FABP), lactoferrin , lactaldherin, Butyrophilin, Adipophilin, peptide ETTVFENLPEK (SEQ ID: 1 ), peptide SFQLFGSPPGQR (SEQ ID: 2), peptide GSNFQLDQLQGR (SEQ ID: 3), peptide FQFIQVAGR597 (SEQ ID: 4), peptide IFIGNVNNSGLK (SEQ ID: 5), peptide INLFDTPLETQYVR (SEQ ID: 6), peptide TPLPLAGPPR (SEQ ID: 7), peptide EGQEQEGEEMAEYR (SEQ ID: 8), peptide SELLVDQYLPLTK (SEQ ID: 9) or combination thereof. 
In one embodiment the composition of the invention comprises proteins able to bind to the probiotic. 
The MFGM and the probiotic of the invention can interact together at the biological level. In particular, the MFGM can enhance or promote the biological effect of the probiotic. In one embodiment the MFGM enables the probiotic to have a biological effect that it would otherwise not have in the absence of MFGM. In one embodiment the MFGM and probiotics could have a synergistic effect in that the beneficial biological effect of the probiotic will be increased. Such a biological effect can comprise the effect on the maturation of the immune system and/or of the gut, the promotion of the anti-infection effect and/or the reduction of inflammation. The probiotic can enhance or promote the biological effect of the MFGM. In one embodiment the probiotic enables the MFGM to have a biological effect that it would otherwise not have in the absence of the probiotic. In one embodiment the probiotic and the MFGM could have a synergistic effect in that the beneficial biological effect of the MFGM will be increased. Such a biological effect can comprise the effect on the maturation of the immune system and/or of the gut, the promotion of the anti-infection effect and/or the reduction of inflammation. 
An infant formula according to the present invention may contain a protein source in an amount of not more than 3.7 or 2.0 g/1 OOkcal, preferably 1 .8 to 2.0 g/1 OOkcal. The source and type of protein (for example from whey or from casein or mixture thereof) in the composition of the invention (i.e. the protein content not originating from MFGM) is not believed to be critical to the present invention provided that the minimum requirements for essential amino acid content are met and provided that satisfactory growth is ensured. However in one embodiment it is preferred that more than 50% or more than 60% by weight of the protein source is whey (hence insuring a best balanced amino-acid profile). Thus, protein sources based on whey, casein and mixtures thereof may be used as well as protein sources based on soy. As far as whey proteins are concerned, the protein source may be based on acid whey or sweet whey or m ixtures thereof and may include alpha-lactalbumin and beta- lactoglobulin in whatever proportions are desired. 
Preferably, however, the major protein source is based on modified sweet whey. Sweet whey is a readily available by-product of cheese making and is frequently used in the manufacture of infant formulas based on cows' milk. However, sweet whey includes a component wh ich is undesirably rich in threonine and poor in tryptophan called caseino-glyco-macropeptide (CGMP). Removal of the CGMP from sweet whey results in a protein with a threonine content closer to that of human milk. This modified sweet whey can then be supplemented with those amino acids in respect of which it has a low content (principally histidine and tryptophan). A process for removing CGMP from sweet whey is described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">EP 880902</bibl> and an infant formula based on this modified sweet whey is described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 01 /1 1 990</bibl>. Using modified sweet whey as the principal protein in the protein source enables all essential am ino acids to be provided at a protein content between 1 .8 and 2.0g/100kcal . Such protein sources have been shown in animal and human studies to have a protein efficiency ratio, n itrogen d igestibil ity, biolog ical value and net protein utilization comparable to standard whey-adapted protein sources with a much higher protein content per 100 kcal and to result in satisfactory growth despite their reduced protein content. If modified sweet whey is used as the protein source, it is preferably supplemented by free histidine in an amount of from 0.1 to 1 .5% by weight of the protein source. 
The proteins may be intact or hydrolyzed or a mixture of intact and hydrolyzed proteins. It may be desirable to supply partially hydrolyzed proteins (degree of hydrolysis between 2 and 20%), for example for infants bel ieved to be at risk of developing cows' milk allergy. If hydrolyzed proteins are required, the hydrolysis process may be carried out as desired and as is known in the art. For example, a whey protein hydrolysate may be prepared by enzymatically hydrolyzing the whey fraction in one or more steps. For an extensively hydrolyzed protein, the whey proteins may be subjected to triple hydrolysis using Alcalase 2.4L (EC 940459), then Neutrase 0.5L (obtainable from Novo Nordisk Ferment AG) and then pancreatin at 55[deg.]C. Alternatively, for a less hydrolyzed protein, the whey may be subjected to a two-stage hydrolysis using trypsin, chymotrypsin or pancreatin or mixtures thereof as described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">EP 322589</bibl>. If the whey fraction used as the starting material is substantially lactose free, it is fou nd that the protein suffers much less lysine blockage during the hydrolysis process. This enables the extent of lysine blockage to be reduced from about 1 5% by weight of total lysine to less than about 1 0% by weight of lysine; for example about 7% by weight of lysine which greatly improves the nutritional qual ity of the protein source. In one embod iment of the invention , the MFGM preparation is subjected to the same proteolytic treatment. 
An infant formula according to the present invention may contain a carbohydrate source. Any carbohydrate source conventionally found in infant formulas such as lactose, saccharose, maltodextrin, starch and mixtures thereof may be used although the preferred source of carbohydrates is lactose. Preferably the carbohydrate sources contribute between 35 and 65% of the total energy of the formula. An infant formula according to the present invention may contain a source of lipids, beside the lipids from the MFGM components. The lipid source may be any lipid or fat which is suitable for use in infant formulas. Preferred fat sources include high oleic sunflower oil and high oleic safflower oil. The essential fatty acids linoleic and a- linolenic acid may also be added as may small amounts of oils containing high quantities of preformed arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid such as fish oils or microbial oils. In total, the fat content is preferably such as to contribute between 30 to 55% of the total energy of the formula. The fat source preferably has a ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids of about 5:1 to about 15:1 ; for example about 8:1 to about 10:1. 
The infant formula may also contain all vitamins and minerals understood to be essential in the daily diet and in nutritionally significant amounts. Minimum requirements have been established for certain vitamins and minerals. Examples of minerals, vitamins and other nutrients optionally present in the infant formula include vitamin A, vitamin Bi, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, vitamin Bi2, vitamin E, vitamin K, vitamin C, vitamin D, folic acid, inositol, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, phosphorous, iodine, iron, magnesium, copper, zinc, manganese, chloride, potassium, sodium, selenium, chromium, molybdenum, taurine, and L-carnitine. Minerals are usually added in salt form. The presence and amounts of specific minerals and other vitamins will vary depending on the intended infant population. 
If necessary, the infant formula may contain emulsifiers and stabilizers such as soy lecithin, citric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides, and the like. This is especially the case if the formula is provided in liquid form. 
The infant formula may optionally contain other substances which may have a beneficial effect such as lactoferrin, nucleotides, nucleosides, and the like. 
Preferably the infant formula also comprises a prebiotic. Suitable prebiotics include certain oligosaccharides, such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS). A combination of prebiotics may be used such as 90% GOS with 10% short chain fructo-oligosaccharides such as the product sold under the trade mark Beneo(R) P95 or 10% inulin such as the product sold under the trade mark Beneo(R) HP, ST or HSI. A particularly preferred prebiotic is a mixture of galacto-oligosaccharide(s), N- acetylated oligosaccharide(s) and sialylated oligosaccharide(s) in which the N- acetylated oligosaccharide(s) comprise 0.5 to 4.0% of the oligosaccharide mixture, the galacto-oligosaccharide(s) comprise 92.0 to 98.5% of the oligosaccharide mixture and the sialylated oligosaccharide(s) comprise 1.0 to 4.0% of the oligosaccharide mixture. This mixture is hereinafter referred to as "the preferred prebiotic mixture". Preferably, a composition for use according to the invention contains from 2.5 to 15.0 wt% of the preferred prebiotic mixture on a dry matter basis with the proviso that the composition comprises at least 0.02 wt% of an N-acetylated oligosaccharide, at least 2.0 wt% of a galacto-oligosaccharide and at least 0.04 wt% of a sialylated oligosaccharide. 
Suitable N-acetylated oligosaccharides include GalNAccd ,3Gai i ,4Glc and Gai i,6GalNAca1,3Gai i,4Glc. The N-acetylated oligosaccharides may be prepared by the action of glucosaminidase and/or galactosaminidase on N-acetyl- glucose and/or N-acetyl galactose. Equally, N-acetyl-galactosyl transferases and/or N-acetyl-glycosyl transferases may be used for this purpose. The N-acetylated oligosaccharides may also be produced by fermentation technology using respective enzymes (recombinant or natural) and/or microbial fermentation. In the latter case the microbes may either express their natural enzymes and substrates or may be engineered to produce respective substrates and enzymes. Single microbial cultures or mixed cultures may be used. N-acetylated oligosaccharide formation can be initiated by acceptor substrates starting from any degree of polymerisation (DP) from DP=1 onwards. Another option is the chemical conversion of keto-hexoses (e.g. fructose) either free or bound to an oligosaccharide (e.g. lactulose) into N- acetylhexosamine or an N-acetylhexosamine containing oligosaccharide as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wrodnigg, T.M.; Stutz, A.E. (1999) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.38:827-828</bibl>. Suitable galacto-oligosaccharides include Gal 1,6Gal, Gal l ,6Gal 1 ,4Glc Gal 1,6Gal 1,6Glc, Gal l ,3Gal 1 ,3Glc, Gal l ,3Gal 1 ,4Glc, 
Gal l ,6Gal 1 ,6Gal 1 ,4Glc, Gal l ,6Gal 1 ,3Gal 1 ,4Glc Gal l ,3Gal 1 ,6Gal 1 ,4Glc, Gal 1,3Gal 1,3Gal 1,4Glc, Gal l ,4Gal 1 ,4Glc and Gal 1,4Gal 1,4Gal 1,4Glc. Synthesised galacto-oligosacchari d e s such as G a I [beta] 1 , 6 G a I [beta] 1 , 4 G I c Ga^1,6Ga^1,6Glc, Ga^1 ,3Ga^1 ,4Glc, Ga^1,6Ga^1,6Ga^1,4Glc,

Other suppliers of oligosaccharides are Dextra Laboratories, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH and Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd. Alternatively, specific glycoslytransferases, such as galactosyltransferases may be used to produce neutral oligosaccharides. 
Suitable sialyl ated oligosaccharides include NeuAca2,3Ga^1 ,4Glc and NeuAca2,6Ga^1,4Glc. These sialylated oligosaccharides may be isolated by chromatographic or filtration technology from a natural source such as animal milks. Alternatively, they may also be produced by biotechnology using specific sialyltransferases either by enzyme based fermentation technology (recombinant or natural enzymes) or by microbial fermentation technology. In the latter case microbes may either express their natural enzymes and substrates or may be engineered to produce respective substrates and enzymes. Single microbial cultures or mixed cultures may be used. Sialyl-oligosaccharide formation can be initiated by acceptor substrates starting from any degree of polymerization (DP) from DP=1 onwards. The infant formula may be prepared in any suitable manner. For example, an infant formula may be prepared by blending together the protein source, the carbohydrate source, and the fat source in appropriate proportions. If used, the emulsifiers may be included in the blend. The vitamins and minerals may be added at this point but are usually added later to avoid thermal degradation. Any lipophilic vitamins, emulsifiers and the like may be dissolved into the fat source prior to blending. Water, preferably water which has been subjected to reverse osmosis, may then be mixed in to form a liquid mixture. 
The liquid mixture may then be thermally treated to reduce undesired viable bacterial loads. For example, the liquid mixture may be rapidly heated to a temperature in the range of about 80[deg.]C to about 110[deg.]C for about 5 seconds to about 5 minutes. This may be carried out by steam injection or by heat exchanger; for example a plate heat exchanger. The liquid mixture may then be cooled to about 60[deg.]C to about 85[deg.]C; for example by flash cooling. The liquid mixture may then be homogenized; for example in two stages at about 7 MPa to about 40 MPa in the first stage and about 2 MPa to about 14 MPa in the second stage. The homogenized mixture may then be further cooled to add any heat sensitive components; such as vitamins and minerals. The pH and solids content of the homogenized mixture is conveniently standardized at this point. 
The homogenized mixture is transferred to a suitable drying apparatus such as a spray drier or freeze drier and converted to powder. The powder should have a moisture content of less than about 5% by weight. 
The selected probiotic(s) may be cultured according to any suitable method and prepared for addition to the infant formula by freeze-drying or spray-drying for example. Alternatively, bacterial preparations can be bought from specialist suppliers such as Christian Hansen and Morinaga already prepared in a suitable form for addition to food products such as infant formula. 
The selected probiotic may be blended to any MFGM preparation before drying. This blend could be homogenized to favor association between MFGM, probiotics and probiotic (s). After drying the blend can be used as a module (added to liquid formula) or MFGM can be mixed to formula powder. 
 Probiotic powder and MFGM powders could be mixed by dry mixing, forming a specific blend. This blend could be added together in the final infant formula powder. Alternately the blend can be added extemporary to the liquid formula.

After drying the probiotic could be incorporated by dry mixing MFGM preparation could also be considered as a good natural emulsifier to reduce the emulsifiers conventionally used in Infant Formula or nutritional compositions. In one embodiment the probiotic and/or the MFGM preparations care added separately or together to a ready-to-drink or ready-to-dilute nutritional composition such as a powder infant formula. Such addition(s) can occur during one of the last process steps of the manufacturing/packaging of the composition or can occur just before the use of the composition by the intended user. In such instance the MFGM preparation and/or the probiotic preparation can be provided separately from the powder or liquid nutritional composition.

Alternatively, in another example, the MFGM ingredient can be used in such amount to achieve a ratio MFGM/ total protein of 0.5%. Example 2 
 The following example presents scientific data developing and supporting the concept of interactions between probiotics and MFGM in mammals breast milk. It follows that compositions comprising both MFGM and probiotics present an advantageous effect. 
In is known from prior art that a low dose of micro-organisms and a range of microbial DNA are contained in human breast milk and are associated with the milk cellular compartment. The inventors have herewith hypothesized that bacteria in milk may be associated with other milk compartments besides the cellular component. For example, they may be transported with in the M FGM or casein micelles. The inventors have analyzed the presence of microbial DNA signals in various fractions of mammals' m i l k . I n F i g u re 1 a n d 2 , temporal Temperature Gradient-gel Electrophoresis (TTGE) has been used. The experiments detected that strong bacterial DNA signals were also found in the cream fraction of the milk (Figures 1 and 2). The finding supports the concept that the MFGM contains bacterial components and/or that the MFGM may bind to or 'envelop' the bacteria in the milk. 
 Further the inventors have investigated the transportation of microbial load. Figure 3 shows microbial components co-located with MFGM. The inventors hypothesize that bacterial binding to or encapsulation of bacteria and/or their components within the M F GM , m ay faci l itate tran sport of the m icrobial components through the gastrointestinal system The inventors believe that this may enhance their delivery to appropriate sites in the mucosal tissues of the suckling neonate. Together with other factors in the MFGM it may further modulate immunological processes. 
Example 3 
 Proteom ics studies of the human M FGM both internally and externally, have identified several proteins which are considered to influence bacterial growth or survival , are involved in the recogn ition of and/or response to microbes or their components, or are known to interact with other proteins which do so. For example, Toll-l ike receptors (TLRs) are a class of cell membrane receptors that recogn ise structurally conserved molecules derived from m icrobes and activate immu ne responses. They are believed to play a key role in the innate immune system . The M FGM comprises molecules wh ich are co-receptors/molecules of TLR signall ing complexes as well as potential ligands for these complexes. 
 Differential responses to pro-inflammatory factors have been observed in vitro, suggesting that the MFGM and/or MFGM fractions may support immune defense mechanisms without promoting exaggerated responses (see table 2). </p><p> 
 
Table 2 : Effect of various fractions contain ing M FGM (whole or d igest) on the expression of factors, showing up-regulation or down-regulation. 
Taken together, it is plausible that delivery of bacteria and/or bacterial components in the presence of MFGM may influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota. It could further modulate immune responses in the recipient host such that there is tolerance to com ponents of the normal m icrobiota and d ietary antigens and protection against potential pathogens or danger signals. 
 Combinations of M FGM and/or MFGM fractions with probiotic organ isms and/or microbial components could be used to educate the immune system and provide protection against early life infections. 
 Overall , M FGM and/or M FGM fractions, when associated with probiotics and/or probiotic components, could promote the interaction of probiotics with the host and modulate downstream processes involved in defense mechanisms. The inventors believe that MFGM and/or MFGM fractions, in combination with probiotics and/or probiotic components, may help modulate the neonatal microbiota composition, support immune development and trigger efficient protective host defense reactions. Th is can i ncl ude im m u ne responses, aga inst various pathogens or other environmental danger. This can be linked to capacity of the probiotics to confer optimal delivery to the host and/or promote host responsiveness to exogenous and endogenous signals. 
Example / Experimental data 4. 
The Interactions of MFGM fractions with the host and potential synergistic effect with probiotics was evaluated in vitro in a system mimicking the gut mucosa (figure 4). The data support a beneficial effect of a combination of MFGM and probiotics on host defences against infections and modulation of inflammatory conditions. HT29CI34 NFkB reporter assays: 
 The HT-29 (human colonic epithelial cells) cell line expresses endogenous TLRs. TLR signalling activates the NF-kB transcription factor either through MyD88 or TRIF adaptator proteins and leads to expression of inflammatory genes. HT-29 cell lines were also transfected with a reporter construct, such that the secreted alkaline posphatase (SeAP) is expressed under the control of a NF-kB inducible promoter. This transfected cell line, HT-29CI34, has been developed at the Nestle Research Center. TLR stimulation of these cells leads to N F-kB activation and subsequent secretion of alkaline posphatase into the culture supernatantin To assess TLR- mediated inflammation, the HT-29CI34 reporter gene system was used to measure levels of NF-kB activation after a pre-treatment with Bifidobacterium lactis NCC2818 (B. lactis) at 10e&lt;6&gt; or 10e&lt;7&gt; CFU/mL and / or MFGM preparation at 50 ug/mL or 100 ug/mL final, followed by incubation with or without LPS (100ng/mL). SeAP activity was assessed by a fluorometric assay and expressed in relative fluorescent units. Bifidobacterium lactis NCC2818 (B. lactis) was selected as a representative of the bifidobacteria! species that are important early colonizers of the infant gut. Figure 5 shows the cumulative, synergistic effect obtained by combining MFGM and probiotics in this modelMFGM alone decreases the responsiveness of epithelial cells to an endotoxin challenge. MFGM + probiotics (B. lactis) exhibits a stronger effect than MFGM alone or probiotics alone (Figure 5 upper and lower panels). B and T cell stimulation assays: 
 Lymphocyte suspensions were prepared from pooled mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes isolated from 6-8 week old C57BL/6 mice. Cells were suspended in IMDM culture medium supplemented with 5x1 0&lt;"5&gt; M P-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 [mu]-g/mL streptomycin and 1 0% FCS. For anti-CD3 (T-cell specific) and anti-CD40 (B-cell specific) stimulation, 96-well flat-bottom plates were coated with 50 [mu]-L PBS containing 2.5 ug/mL anti-CD3 (clone: 2C1 1 ) or 5 ug/mL anti- CD40 (clone: FGK-45) 1 -3h at 37[deg.]C. After extensive washing, serial 3-fold dilutions of lymph node cell suspensions were added per well. After 3 days, 1 [mu]-Ci/well &lt;3&gt;H- thymidine was added for the last 18 h prior to harvesting. When said NCC2818 (B. lactis) obtained from standard cultures were added to the well together with the MFGM preparation at MOI 100 and/or 100 ug/mL final concentration . Results of the assay performed with optimal titration of lymphoid cells (1 1 1 [Omicron]00 cells/well) are presented in Figures 6 and 7. The results highlight the synergistic effect of a probiotic with MFGM. 
Example 5 
 The interactions of MFGM fractions with the host and potential synergistic and long lasting effects in association with probiotics were evaluated in vivo in a mouse model of neonatal maturation. The data support a beneficial effect of a combination of MFGM and probiotics on non-specific adaptive host defences against infections via an increase in secretory mucosal IgA. Recently weaned mice (28 day old) were fed for 1 week (A) and 4 weeks (B) as below: 
 Group 1 : Placebo (maltodextrin) 
Group 2: Bifidobacterium lactis BL818 (108 CFU/day) 
Group 3: Bifidobacterium lactis BL818 (108 CFU/day) + MFGM 
Group 4: MFGM 
MFGM was administered daily at a dose of 0.6 mg/g of body weight. The ingredients, B. lactis and/or MFGM, were administrated orally. Recently weaned animals were used to avoid an effect of the MFGM naturally present in mouse breastmilk. IgA-secreting cell numbers in Peyer's patches cell suspensions were evaluated in 10 animals per group using a standard ELISPOT protocol. Our data (figure 8) show that MFGM can have strong effects on adaptive immune B cells. Indeed, we observed a significant increase in the number of intestinal IgA-secreting cells isolated from the Peyer's patches of mice fed with MFGM and/or probiotics. Interestingly, we observed that the combination of MFGM and B. lactis significantly increases the IgA-secreting mucosal B cells numbers after 28 days of feeding and the numbers are greater than those observed after feeding of the individual ingredients. Even more interestingly, we observed a long-lasting immune boost effect of MFGM and B. lactis feeding. More specifically, the increase in IgA-secreting mucosal B cell numbers persists and indeed, is further increased 84 days after feeding of the ingredients was stopped (day 1 1 2). Importantly, the effect of the combination of probiotics and MFGM was sign ificantly h igher than that obtained with the ind ividual ingred ients, wh ich demonstrates a synergistic effect when feeding the combination of probiotics and MFGM.
