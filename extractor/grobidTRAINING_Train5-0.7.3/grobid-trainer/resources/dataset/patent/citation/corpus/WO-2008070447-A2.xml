Chronic infection with HCV is a major health problem associated with liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure.
 An estimated 170 million chronic carriers worldwide are at risk of developing liver disease.&lt;1&gt;'&lt;2&gt; In the United States alone 2.7 million are chronically infected with HCV, and the number of HCV -related deaths in 2000 was estimated between 8,000 and 10,000, a number that is expected to increase significantly over the next years. Infection by HCV is insidious in a high proportion of chronically infected (and infectious) carriers who may not experience clinical symptoms for many years. Liver cirrhosis can ultimately lead to liver failure. Liver failure resulting from chronic HCV infection is now recognized as a leading cause of liver transplantation.

HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae family of RNA viruses that affect animals and humans.
 The genome is a single ¯9.6-kilobase strand of RNA, and consists of one open reading frame that encodes for a polyprotein of -3000 amino acids flanked by untranslated regions at both 5' and 3' ends (5'- and 3'-UTR). The polyprotein serves as the precursor to at least 10 separate viral proteins critical for replication and assembly of progeny viral particles. The organization of structural and non-structural proteins in the HCV polyprotein is as follows: C-El-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4a-NS4b-NS5a-NS5b. Because the replicative cycle of HCV does not involve any DNA intermediate and the virus is not integrated into the host genome, HCV infection can theoretically be cured.
 While the pathology of HCV infection affects mainly the liver, the virus is found in other cell types in the body including peripheral blood lymphocytes.&lt;3&gt;'&lt;4&gt;

At present, the standard treatment for chronic HCV is interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) in combination with ribavirin and this requires at least six (6) months of treatment. IFN- alpha belongs to a family of naturally occurring small proteins with characteristic biological effects such as antiviral, immunoregulatory and antitumoral activities that are produced and secreted by most animal nucleated cells in response to several diseases, in particular viral infections. IFN-alpha is an important regulator of growth and differentiation affecting cellular communication and immunological control.
 Treatment of HCV with interferon has frequently been associated with adverse side effects such as fatigue, fever, chills, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, mild alopecia, psychiatric effects and associated disorders, autoimmune phenomena and associated disorders and thyroid dysfunction. Ribavirin, an inhibitor of inosine 5 '-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), enhances the efficacy of IFN-alpha in the treatment of HCV. Despite the introduction of ribavirin, more than 50% of the patients do not eliminate the virus with the current standard therapy of interferon-alpha (IFN) and ribavirin. By now, standard therapy of chronic hepatitis C has been changed to the combination of pegylated IFN-alpha plus ribavirin. However, a number of patients still have significant side effects, primarily related to ribavirin.
 Ribavirin causes significant hemolysis in 10-20% of patients treated at currently recommended doses, and the drug is both teratogenic and embryotoxic. Even with recent improvements, a substantial fraction of patients do not respond with a sustained reduction in viral load &lt;5&gt; and there is a clear need for more effective antiviral therapy of HCV infection. A number of approaches are being pursuit to combat the virus. They include, for example, application of antisense oligonucleotides or ribozymes for inhibiting HCV replication. Furthermore, low-molecular weight compounds that directly inhibit HCV proteins and interfere with viral replication are considered as attractive strategies to control HCV infection.
 Among the viral targets, the NS3/4A protease/helicase and the NS5b RNA- dependent RNA polymerase are considered the most promising viral targets for new drugs.&lt;6"&gt;

8

Besides targeting viral genes and their transcription and translation products, antiviral activity can also be achieved by targeting host cell proteins that are necessary for viral replication. For example, Watashi et al. &lt;9&gt; show how antiviral activity can be achieved by inhibiting host cell cyclophilins.
 Alternatively, a potent TLR7 agonist has been shown to reduce HCV plasma levels in humans. &lt;10&gt;

However, none of the compounds described above have progressed beyond clinical trials. &lt;6&gt;'&lt;8&gt;

Notwithstanding the above, the discovery of new compounds active against one or more members of the Flaviviridae family of viruses would be beneficial particularly in view of the difficulty currently faced in treating diseases mediated, at least in part, by one or more of such viruses.

These agent include an inhibitor of HCV proteases, HCV polymerase, HCV helicase, HCV NS4B protein, HCV entry, HCV assembly, HCV egress, HCV NS5A protein, or inosine 5 '-monophosphate dehydrogenase.
 In other embodiments, the agent is interferon.

Administration and Pharmaceutical Composition

In general, the compounds of this invention will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. The actual amount of the compound of this invention, i.e., the active ingredient, will depend upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of administration, and other factors. The drug can be administered more than once a day, preferably once or twice a day.
 All of these factors are within the skill of the attending clinician.

Therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of Formula (I)-(III) may range from approximately 0.05 to 50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day; preferably about 0.1-25 mg/kg/day, more preferably from about 0.5 to 10 mg/kg/day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would most preferably be about 35- 70 mg per day.

In general, compounds of this invention will be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by any one of the following routes: oral, systemic (e.g., transdermal, intranasal or by suppository), or parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous) administration. The preferred manner of administration is oral using a convenient daily dosage regimen that can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction.
 Compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, or any other appropriate compositions. Another preferred manner for administering compounds of this invention is inhalation. This is an effective method for delivering a therapeutic agent directly to the respiratory tract (see <ref type="patent">U. S. Patent 5,607,915</ref>).

The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drug administration and bioavailability of the drug substance. For delivery via inhalation the compound can be formulated as liquid solution, suspensions, aerosol propellants or dry powder and loaded into a suitable dispenser for administration. There are several types of pharmaceutical inhalation devices-nebulizer inhalers, metered dose inhalers (MDI) and dry powder inhalers (DPI).
 Nebulizer devices produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the therapeutic agents (which are formulated in a liquid form) to spray as a mist that is carried into the patient's respiratory tract. MDFs typically are formulation packaged with a compressed gas. Upon actuation, the device discharges a measured amount of therapeutic agent by compressed gas, thus affording a reliable method of administering a set amount of agent. DPI dispenses therapeutic agents in the form of a free flowing powder that can be dispersed in the patient's inspiratory air-stream during breathing by the device. In order to achieve a free flowing powder, the therapeutic agent is formulated with an excipient such as lactose.
 A measured amount of the therapeutic agent is stored in a capsule form and is dispensed with each actuation.

Recently, pharmaceutical formulations have been developed especially for drugs that show poor bioavailability based upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area i.e., decreasing particle size. For example, <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 4,107,288</ref> describes a pharmaceutical formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm in which the active material is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. <ref type="patent">U.S.
 Patent No. 5,145,684</ref> describes the production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug substance is pulverized to nanoparticles (average particle size of 400 nm) in the presence of a surface modifier and then dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation that exhibits remarkably high bioavailability.

The compositions are comprised of in general, a compound of Formula (I)-(III) in combination with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients are non-toxic, aid administration, and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the compound of Formula (I)-(III).
 Such excipient may be any solid, liquid, semi-solid or, in the case of an aerosol composition, gaseous excipient that is generally available to one of skill in the art.

Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk and the like. Liquid and semisolid excipients may be selected from glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol and various oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, etc. Preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions, include water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols. Compressed gases may be used to disperse a compound of this invention in aerosol form.
 Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc. Other suitable pharmaceutical excipients and their formulations are described in <ref type="npl">Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, edited by E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Company, 18th ed., 1990)</ref>. The amount of the compound in a formulation can vary within the full range employed by those skilled in the art. Typically, the formulation will contain, on a weight percent (wt%) basis, from about 0.01-99.99 wt% of a compound of Formula (I)-(III) based on the total formulation, with the balance being one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients. Preferably, the compound is present at a level of about 1-80 wt%.
 Representative pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of Formula (I)-(III) are described below.

Additionally, the present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of another active agent against RNA- dependent RNA virus and, in particular, against HCV.

Scheme 1 shows a general synthesis of compounds of the invention where, for illustrative purposes ring A is a substituted phenyl ring, p is 0, and Z-R together form a benzyloxycarbonyl group. Reaction of halide 1.1 with an azide such as sodium azide gives

1.2 that is then treated with a reducing agent such as PI13P to form imine 1.3.
 Exposure of

1.3 to a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride gives amine 1.4 that is then functionalized such as by reacting carbonylbenzyloxy chloride to give carbamate 1.5. Reaction of intermediate 1.5 with an aryl boronic acid or a suitable coupling partner in a transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling reaction gives compound 1.6. Suitable transition metal catalysts include Pd based catalysts (e.g. Pd(PPh3 )2C12, Pd[P(Ph3)]4, etc.) such as those used in a Suzuki coupling.

 Anti-Hepatitis C Activity

Compounds can exhibit anti-hepatitis C activity by inhibiting viral and host cell targets required in the replication cycle. A number of assays have been published to assess these activities. A general method that assesses the gross increase of HCV virus in culture is disclosed in <ref type="patent">U.S. Patent No. 5,738,985</ref> to Miles et al In vitro assays have been reported in <ref type="npl">Ferrari et al J. ofVir., 73:1649-1654, 1999</ref>; <ref type="npl">Ishii et al, Hepatology, 29:1227-1235, 1999</ref>; <ref type="npl">Lohmann et al, J. of Bio.

Replicon Assay

A cell line, ET (Huh-lucubineo-ET) was used for screening of compounds of the present invention for inhibiting HCV replication.
 The ET cell line was stably transfected with RNA transcripts harboring a I3gc&gt;luc-ubi-neo/NS3-37ET; replicon with firefly luciferase-ubiquitin-neomycin phosphotransferase fusion protein and EMCV-IRES driven NS3-5B polyprotein containing the cell culture adaptive mutations (E1202G; T1280I; Kl 846T) (Krieger at al, 2001 and unpublished). The ET cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbeco's Modified Eagle's Medium), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM Glutamine, Penicillin (100 IU/mL)/Streptomycin (100 [mu]g/mL), Ix nonessential amino acids, and 250 [mu]g/mL G418 ("Geneticin"). They were all available through Life Technologies (Bethesda, MD). The cells were plated at 0.5-1.0 xlO&lt;4&gt; cells/well in the 96 well plates and incubated for 24 hrs before adding testing compounds. Then the compounds were added to the cells to achieve a final concentration of 0.
 InM to 50 [mu]M and a final DMSO concentration of 0.5%. Luciferase activity were measured 48-72 hours later by adding a lysis buffer and the substrate (Catalog number Glo-lysis buffer E2661 and Bright-Glo luciferase system E2620 Promega, Madison, WI). Cells should not be too confluent during the assay. Percent inhibition of replication was plotted relative to no compound control. Under the same condition, cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using cell proliferation reagent, WST-I (Roche, Germany). The compounds showing antiviral activities, but no significant cytotoxicities were chosen to determine EC50 and TC50. For these determinations, a 10 point 2-fold serial dilution for each compound was used, which spans a concentration range of 1000 fold.
 EC50 and similarly TC50 values were calculated by fitting %inhibition at each concentration to the following equation:

% inhibition = 100%/[(IC50/[I])&lt;b&gt; +1] where b is Hill's coefficient. Preferably, when tested at lOO[mu]M the compounds of this invention will exhibit a % inhibition of at least 30% and more preferably a % inhibition of at least 50%.

When tested at 10 [mu]M, the compounds in Table 1 were found to have the indicated percent inhibition values shown in Table 2. Compounds of Table 1 with % inhibition of less than 1% are not included in Table 2, but may have greater activity when tested at higher concentrations.
