No. 5,900,756</ref>, issued May 4, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading><p>[0002] 1. Technical Field of the Invention </p><p>[0003] The present invention relates to integrated circuits and, in particular, to a bias circuit for a programmable storage cell that utilizes a floating-gate transistor as a storage unit. </p><p>[0004] 2. Description of Related Art </p><p>[0005] Read-only memories are commonly organized in matrix form, utilizing rows and columns. The rows are referred to as bit rows, and the columns are referred to as word columns. Each intersection of a row and column forms a storage cell whose electrical state represents an information element. Depending on the technology used, these storage cells are programmable one or more times, and they can be erased individually or comprehensively. </p><p>[0006] The rows and the columns of the memories are generally tested following production to ensure that access can be made to all the storage cells of the memories and that each cell can be programmed and erased in such a way that there is definite knowledge, at any time, of the electrical state of the storage cells. </p><p>[0007] A programmable memory circuit typically comprises a floating-gate transistor, commonly called a fuse, that is series-connected with a current source. Each floating-gate transistor represents one address bit. Depending on the electrical state of the floating-gate transistor (i.e., whether there are electrons present at its gate), the fuse behaves like an open circuit or like a resistor. If it behaves like a resistor, it may conduct current. On the contrary, if it behaves like an open circuit, it can not conduct current. A current detector may then be used to read the data stored therein by detecting the currents flowing at each fuse. </p><p>[0008] Reference is now made to FIG. 1 wherein there is shown an integrated circuit <b>1</b> in accordance with <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 5,900,756</ref>. The circuit <b>1</b> includes a plurality of storage circuits <b>2</b> (not all of which are represented). Each storage circuit <b>2</b> includes a cell referred to as a fuse. More specifically, the fuse is a floating-gate transistor <b>3</b> that is series connected with an N type isolation transistor <b>4</b> between a reference terminal <b>5</b> and a supply terminal <b>6</b>. Typically, the reference terminal <b>5</b> gives a ground potential GND and the supply terminal <b>6</b> gives a positive supply potential VCC of the order of some volts (for example, five volts). </p><p>[0009] The floating-gate transistor <b>3</b> is connected through its control gate, by means of a circuit (not explicitly shown), to either the ground potential GND or the supply potential VCC. The source of transistor <b>3</b> is connected to the ground terminal <b>5</b> and the drain of transistor <b>3</b> is connected to the source of the isolation transistor <b>4</b>. The isolation transistor <b>4</b> has its drain connected through a resistor <b>25</b> to the supply terminal <b>6</b>. </p><p>[0010] A programming and reading circuit <b>7</b> is connected to the drain of the floating-gate transistor <b>3</b> and is also connected to the drain of the isolation transistor <b>4</b>. In a first mode of operation referred to as a “programming mode,” the circuit <b>7</b> applies a voltage of some volts to the floating-gate transistor <b>3</b>, with the control gate of this transistor <b>3</b> being connected to ground. In a second mode of operation referred to as a “reading mode,” the circuit <b>7</b> detects a possible passage of current through resistor <b>25</b> and hence into the floating-gate transistor <b>3</b>. This passage of current depends on the electrical state of the floating-gate transistor <b>3</b> (namely the presence or non-presence of electrons on the floating gate). </p><p>[0011] More specifically, the circuit <b>2</b> operates in the following manner: </p><p>[0012] in programming mode, depending on the electrical state desired, a high value (for example, 10 volts) is applied (or not applied) on the drain of the floating-gate transistor in order to inject (or not inject) electrons into the floating gate, the control gate of the floating gate transistor is connected to ground, and the control gate of the isolation transistor is also connected to ground; and </p><p>[0013] in reading mode (i.e., current passage detection to read the addressed bit), the N type isolation transistor is biased positively at its control gate in order to be turned on, and the control gate of the floating-gate transistor is connected to a positive supply potential VCC given by the supply terminal. </p><p>[0014] When configured in the reading mode, the isolation transistor is on and a current may flow, as the case may be, depending on the electrical state of the floating-gate transistor. The isolation transistor is used to impose a constant voltage on the drain of the floating-gate transistor to have the same reading conditions whatever the current given by the supply terminal. In this case, the current read is only a function of the threshold voltage of the floating-gate transistor, and this threshold voltage varies according to the electrical state of this transistor. </p><p>[0015] To impose a constant voltage on the drain of the floating-gate transistor, a constant bias voltage is imposed on the isolation transistor. This bias voltage is typically twice the threshold voltage Vt of the isolation transistor (wherein typically Vt is approximately one volt). A low bias voltage is chosen in order to limit the current produced and hence the consumption of the circuit. </p><p>[0016] A bias circuit, capable of giving adequate voltage in programming mode (for the connection to the ground of the control gate of the isolation transistors), is accordingly needed to operate the circuit <b>2</b>. Irrespective of the mode of operation in effect, the bias circuit must provide the proper bias voltage. This is the case, for example, in a watch mode of operation wherein the memory is supplied with bias but is not currently being used for reading or writing. It is preferable that the bias circuit operate as quickly as possible during the activation of the memory (for example, when reading and writing). </p><p>[0017] The integrated circuit <b>1</b> accordingly includes a first bias circuit <b>8</b> having a control terminal <b>10</b> and an output terminal <b>11</b>. The first bias circuit <b>8</b> is formed by two arms, each arm consisting of series-connected transistors between the supply terminal <b>6</b> and the ground terminal <b>5</b>. A first arm <b>12</b> has a P type transistor <b>14</b><i>a </i>whose source is connected to the supply terminal <b>6</b> and whose drain is connected to the drain of an N type transistor <b>15</b><i>a</i>. The source of the N type transistor <b>15</b><i>a </i>is connected to the drain and to the control gate of an N type transistor <b>16</b><i>a</i>, configured as a diode, with the source of transistor <b>16</b><i>a </i>being connected to the ground terminal <b>5</b>. The second arm <b>13</b> of the first bias circuit <b>8</b> similarly includes a P type transistor <b>14</b><i>b </i>whose source is connected to the supply terminal <b>6</b> and whose drain is connected to the drain of an N type transistor <b>15</b><i>b</i>. The source of this N type transistor <b>15</b><i>b </i>is connected to the drain and to the control gate of an N type transistor <b>17</b>, configured as a diode. The source of the transistor <b>17</b> is connected to the drain and to the control gate of an N type transistor <b>16</b><i>b</i>, also configured as a diode, with the source of transistor <b>16</b><i>b </i>being connected to the ground terminal <b>5</b>. The control gates of the P type transistors <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>are connected to each other and to the control terminal <b>10</b>. The control gate of the N type transistor <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the second arm <b>13</b> is connected to the drain of the P type transistor <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the first arm <b>12</b>. The control gate of the N type transistor <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the first arm <b>12</b> is connected to the source of the N type transistor <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the second arm <b>13</b>. The source of transistor <b>15</b><i>b </i>is further connected to the output terminal <b>11</b>. The first bias circuit <b>8</b> further includes an N type transistor <b>18</b> mounted at the output between the output terminal <b>11</b> and the ground terminal <b>5</b>. This output N type transistor <b>18</b> has its control gate connected to the control terminal <b>10</b>. </p><p>[0018] A brief description of the operation of the first bias circuit <b>8</b> will now be provided. The control terminal <b>10</b> receives a first binary control signal VB<b>0</b>. The output terminal <b>11</b> supplies a binary bias voltage VB to the storage circuits <b>2</b>. This bias voltage VB takes a first binary value when the first control signal VB<b>0</b> is in a first state (VB<b>0</b>=1) and a second binary value when the first control signal VB<b>0</b> is in a second state (VB<b>0</b>=0). </p><p>[0019] If Vt designates the threshold voltage of the isolation transistor <b>4</b>, then the first binary value of VB is equal to the ground potential GND and the second binary value of VB is equal to 2*Vt. The first binary value of VB corresponds to an operation that isolates the floating-gate transistor <b>3</b> from the current source formed by the resistor <b>25</b> and the supply terminal <b>6</b> (for use in programming mode operation). The second binary value of VB corresponds to an operation that connects the floating-gate transistor <b>3</b> to this current source (for use in reading mode operation). </p><p>[0020] This first bias circuit <b>8</b> is a source of current-controlled voltage (if VB<b>0</b>=0, of course). The P type transistor <b>14</b><i>a </i>acts as a resistor, whereas transistors <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>operate in a feedback manner to keep the voltage at the control electrode of transistor <b>15</b><i>b </i>at a predictable potential. This in turn guarantees a predictable potential VB at the terminal <b>11</b>. Should the resistance of transistor <b>14</b><i>a </i>vary with process, causing the current through transistor <b>14</b><i>a </i>to increase, the connection of transistor <b>15</b><i>b </i>causes the device <b>15</b><i>a </i>to decrease its current, which tends to counteract the original change. Thus, by negative feedback, it is ensured that there will be a precise and stable bias voltage VB available at the output <b>11</b>. </p><p>[0021] The transistors <b>16</b><i>b </i>and <b>17</b> that are connected as diodes on the second arm <b>13</b> between the output terminal <b>11</b> and the ground terminal <b>5</b> enable the fixing of the bias voltage VB as a value equivalent to two threshold voltages Vt when VB<b>0</b>=0. The N type output transistor <b>18</b> enables the rapid pulling of the output terminal <b>11</b> to the ground potential GND when the connection between the floating-gate transistors <b>3</b> of the storage circuits <b>2</b> and the corresponding current sources (VB<b>0</b>=1) is cut. Furthermore, this makes it possible to ensure a known value of the voltage VB present at this time at the output terminal <b>11</b>. This is important because it is possible that there might be a floating node at this place by parasitic capacitive effect. </p><p>[0022]FIG. 2A illustrates the temporal evolution of the output bias voltage VB using the circuit <b>8</b> in response to a step transition of VB<b>0</b> from one to zero. </p><p>[0023] A present trend in the design of circuits <b>1</b> of the foregoing type leans towards the development of integrated circuits that work with variable supply voltage values. For example, circuits are being developed that can work as well with a 3-volt supply voltage as has been experienced with a 5-volt supply voltage. However, the bias circuit should be capable of supplying the positive bias voltage at high speed (typically within less than one μsec). The bias circuit <b>8</b> described above is relatively fast and consumes little power when operating at five volts (see, FIG. 2A). However, this circuit, along with other comparable biasing circuits, is not suitable for low supply voltages (for example, on the order of three volts) because their build-up time to VB unsatisfactorily exceeds one μsec. </p><p>[0024] A second bias circuit <b>9</b> is accordingly provided to give a bias voltage to the isolation transistors having a response time constant that is relatively fast for supply voltages on the order of 3 volts. The second bias circuit <b>9</b> has an output terminal <b>19</b> and a control terminal <b>20</b>. The input of an inverter <b>21</b> is connected to the control terminal <b>20</b>. The output of this inverter <b>21</b> is connected to the output terminal <b>19</b> by means of a capacitor <b>22</b>. The inverter <b>21</b> is made in a standard way by the series-connection of P and N type transistors <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> between a supply terminal <b>6</b> and a reference terminal <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0025] The control terminal <b>20</b> of the second bias circuit <b>9</b> receives a second binary control signal VB<b>0</b>. The output terminal <b>19</b> of this second bias circuit supplies a binary bias voltage VB to the storage circuits <b>2</b>. This bias voltage VB assumes a first binary value when the second control signal VB<b>0</b> is in a first state (VB<b>0</b>=1) and a second binary value when said second control signal VB<b>0</b> is in a second state (VB<b>0</b>=0). </p><p>[0026]FIG. 2B illustrates the temporal elevation of the output voltage VB using only the circuit <b>9</b> in response to a step transition of VB from one to zero. </p><p>[0027] Preferably, the output terminal <b>19</b> and the control terminal <b>20</b> of the second bias circuit <b>9</b> are connected to the corresponding terminals of the first bias circuit <b>8</b>. Similarly, the supply terminal <b>6</b> and the ground terminal <b>5</b>, as used by the two bias circuits <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, are identical. </p><p>[0028]FIG. 2C illustrates the temporal elevation of the output voltage VB when the circuits <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> are used together. This illustrates an improvement in response time (delta t) that is experienced with use of both circuits <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> in low voltage (for example, three volts) environment. </p><p>[0029] While the foregoing circuit <b>1</b> is relatively simple to implement and effectively provides extra current during charging time, the duration of the extra current that is supplied is controlled by an analog differentiation circuit that is somewhat uncorrelated with the capacitance of the bias voltage supply line leading to each of the circuits <b>2</b>. This raises several concerns. First, the extra amount of charge that is supplied is mostly dependent upon the supply voltage and is therefore uncorrelated with bias voltage that is mostly constant. Second, the size of the boost capacitor <b>22</b> must be carefully chosen dependent on the size of the memory array. More specifically, it is recognized that the total capacitive load on the bias line is affected by both thin and thick oxide components. Accordingly, it is somewhat uncorrelated with the capacitance of the boost capacitor <b>22</b>. If the boost capacitor <b>22</b> value is chosen too small, then inadequate extra charge is delivered during boost, and a slow response results. If, on the other hand, the boost capacitance value is too large (either from initial selection or process variations), then the bias voltage line will be boosted too much and extra time will be required to settle the bias voltage line back down to a desired voltage value. Third, the bias voltage itself is recognized to have a temperature coefficient. This means that the theoretically perfect amount of boost charge varies with temperature. </p><p>[0030] It is accordingly recognized that the prior art circuit of FIG. 1 suffers from a number of controllability concerns, and a need exists for a circuit that addresses these concerns while still being able to provide extra boost current needed to achieve a rapid response time. </p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading><p>[0031] A bias circuit includes a bias voltage generator and a boost circuit. The bias voltage generator produces a voltage signal that transitions from a first value to a second value in response to a change in a control signal. The boost circuit responds to the transition of the voltage signal from the first value by generating a boost current. The voltage signal and boost current are combined to provide an output bias voltage. </p><p>[0032] A method for generating an output bias voltage includes the step of generating a voltage signal that transitions from a first value to a second value in response to a change in a control signal. The transition of the voltage signal from the first value is then detected causing the generation of a boost current. The voltage signal and the boost current are then combined to provide an output bias voltage.</p><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading><p>[0033] A more complete understanding of the method and apparatus of the present invention may be acquired by reference to the following Detailed Description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying Drawings wherein: </p><p>[0034]FIG. 1, previously described, is a circuit diagram illustrating an integrated circuit in accordance with <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 5,900,756</ref>; </p><p>[0035] FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C, previously described, illustrate temporal evolutions of bias voltage response in connection with the circuit of FIG. 1; </p><p>[0036]FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram illustrating an integrated circuit in accordance with the present invention; </p><p>[0037]FIG. 4 illustrates a temporal evolution of the bias voltage response in connection with the circuit of FIG. 3; </p><p>[0038]FIGS. 5A and 5B show generic representations of the circuit of FIG. 3; and </p><p>[0039] FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>10</b> are circuit diagram of various embodiments of the circuit of FIGS. 3, 5A and <b>5</b>B.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading><p>[0040] Reference is now made to FIG. 3 wherein there is shown an integrated circuit <b>100</b> in accordance with the invention. The circuit <b>100</b> shares a number of common components with the circuit <b>1</b> of FIG. 1. Common reference numbers are used for these shared common components, and the description of FIG. 3 incorporates by reference the prior description of these common components. No further discussion of these common components, except to the extent necessary to explain operation of the circuit <b>100</b>, will be provided. The circuit <b>100</b> includes a bias circuit <b>102</b> that generates a bias voltage in the manner discussed above and illustrated in FIG. 2A. The circuit <b>100</b> further includes a boost current circuit <b>104</b> whose operation will be described. </p><p>[0041] The bias circuit <b>102</b> (also reference <b>8</b> for the circuit <b>1</b> of FIG. 1) is somewhat slow to respond to changes in VB<b>0</b> because the N type transistor <b>15</b><i>b </i>is current limited by the P type transistor <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The transistor <b>15</b><i>b </i>acts like a source follower with a significant resistance in its drain circuit. </p><p>[0042] The foregoing problems are addressed by the circuit <b>100</b> of FIG. 3 that comprises the bias circuit <b>102</b> (also referred to as a reference bias generator) and a boost current circuit <b>104</b> (also referred to as a bias driver) to replace the second bias circuit <b>9</b> of FIG. 1 and supplement the operation of the circuit <b>102</b> to provide faster response for the bias voltage. The boost current circuit <b>104</b> includes an N type transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>whose drain is connected to the supply terminal <b>6</b> and whose source is connected to the output terminal <b>11</b>. The control gate of the transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>is connected to the control gate of the transistor <b>15</b><i>b </i>(that is connected, as previously described, to the drain of the P type transistor <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the first arm <b>12</b>). The circuit <b>100</b> further includes an N type transistor <b>20</b> whose drain is connected to the control gate of the transistors <b>15</b><i>b </i>and <b>15</b><i>c </i>(as well as the drain of the P type transistor <b>14</b><i>a</i>). The source of transistor <b>20</b> is connected to the ground terminal <b>5</b>. The control gate of transistor <b>20</b> is connected to the control gate of the transistor <b>18</b> (that is connected, as previously described, to the control terminal <b>10</b>). </p> <p>[0043] In this first embodiment, the transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>is conveniently sized from one-half to two times the size of transistor <b>15</b><i>b. </i></p><p>[0044] Under transient conditions, transistor <b>15</b> <i>c </i>acts as a true source follower (or voltage follower) and delivers only as much current as the capacitive load (represented by the storage circuits <b>2</b>) requires. However, in normal, quiescent, operation the transistor <b>15</b> <i>c </i>advantageously does not cause any more current to be drawn than would have been experienced with the prior art circuit. Upon start-up, the transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>has a very large gate-to-source voltage so that it reacts immediately to a transition in the generated bias voltage from, for example, zero volts with generation of a significant amount of charging (boost) current to rapidly charge up the capacitive bias line at the output terminal <b>11</b>. Initially, the transistor <b>15</b> <i>c </i>can deliver more charge current than transistor <b>15</b><i>b </i>because it has no significant impedance in its drain circuit. The circuit operates with series negative feedback, and thus when the capacitive bias line is charged up to the proper voltage the boost current delivered from the transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>is automatically reduced. Rapid charging of the bias line for a selected circuit <b>2</b> is thus provided, and this allows for a faster reading of the associated, selected, memory cell. Notably, the transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>only supplies this extra boost current when needed. </p><p>[0045] The transistor <b>20</b> provides an important safety feature for the circuit <b>100</b>. VB<b>0</b> is the turn-off command for the circuit <b>102</b>. Transistor <b>18</b> responds to this command by pulling the output terminal <b>11</b> (and also the source of transistor <b>15</b><i>c</i>) to ground. At the same time, transistor <b>20</b> pulls the gates of transistors <b>15</b><i>b </i>and <b>15</b><i>c </i>to ground. If transistor <b>20</b> were not present, then when transistor <b>18</b> pulls the source of transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>to ground, a large current (on the order of a few milliamps) could flow through transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>and transistor <b>18</b>. While this may not be significant enough to destroy any of the devices, this current may persist for a while in the absence of transistor <b>20</b> since the gate potential of transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>is floating. Transistor <b>20</b> operates to pull the gate of transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>to ground and provide an added level of assurance that the circuit <b>102</b> is turned off. </p><p>[0046] The circuit <b>102</b> is faster in operation than the circuit <b>1</b> using only bias circuit <b>8</b> as shown in FIG. 1 (see, delta t in FIG. 4 in comparison to FIG. 2A). One reason for this is because transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>quickly provides extra charging (boost) current responsive to initial transition of the bias voltage and continues to supply the current for as long as the bias voltage has not reached the desired value. Still further, the circuit <b>102</b> utilizes less silicon area due to the fact that there is no need for a capacitor <b>22</b>. In addition, there are no matching or correlation issues with respect to the capacitance of the capacitor <b>22</b> and the distributed capacitance of the remainder of the circuit <b>102</b>. More specifically, the circuit <b>102</b> is not plagued by the difficulties associated with setting the separate time constant for the bias circuit <b>9</b>. Still further, operation of the circuit <b>102</b> has substantially no dependence on the supply voltage or temperature. Another advantage of the circuit <b>102</b> is that it works well without significant tuning and with different sized memory arrays and therefore with different capacitance loading. </p><p>[0047] Reference is now made to FIG. 5A wherein there is shown a generic representation of the circuit <b>102</b>. This generic representation includes a reference side <b>200</b> that generates the required bias voltage (for example, 3*Vt at node <b>207</b>) and a voltage follower <b>202</b> configured to supply a significant amount of drive current with little quiescent current. The desired VB=2*Vt exists at output <b>11</b>. A general implementation of this generic representation is shown in FIG. 5A comprising a reference voltage generator <b>204</b> connected in series with a resistor <b>206</b> between the supply terminal <b>6</b> and reference terminal (ground) <b>5</b>. The generator <b>204</b> and resistor <b>206</b> operate responsive to VB<b>0</b> application to generate an output bias voltage (VB) at output <b>11</b>. The voltage follower <b>202</b> comprises the transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>with its gate connected to receive the output of the generator <b>204</b> on line <b>207</b>. The drain of the transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>is connected to the supply terminal <b>6</b>. The source of the transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>is connected to the output terminal <b>11</b> and to a current source <b>208</b> that is connected to ground <b>5</b>. In operation, the generator <b>204</b> supplies the appropriate voltage for the bias operation, but its response time when driving significant capacitance is too slow. To enhance operation, the circuit of FIG. 5A utilizes the transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>connected in a voltage follower configuration to not only pass the generator <b>204</b> provided output voltage on line <b>207</b> to terminal <b>11</b>, but also (in transient conditions with ramp up of generator <b>204</b> bias voltage output at the gate of transistor <b>15</b><i>c</i>) deliver a significant amount of boost current to charge the bias output line at terminal <b>11</b> (see, also, FIG. 4). As the bias voltage at output <b>11</b> reaches its 2*Vt target, the boost current supplied by the transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>automatically reduces down to a small quiescent value determined by bias current <b>208</b>. </p><p>[0048]FIG. 5B illustrates an alternative representation where current source <b>208</b> in the voltage follower <b>202</b> is replaced by the reference voltage generator <b>204</b> (which in this case may, for example, be 2*Vt), and the gate of transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>is connected to ground <b>5</b> by an N type transistor <b>210</b> and optimal load device <b>220</b>. The gate of transistor <b>210</b> is connected to the output of the reference voltage generator <b>204</b>. Operation in this circuit is analogous to that described above in connection with FIG. 5A. The gate of transistor <b>15</b><i>c </i>is connected to detect generation of the bias voltage by the generator <b>204</b> and responds thereto with source generation of the boost current to rapidly charge the output terminal <b>11</b>. </p><p>[0049] Although not specifically illustrated, the generic representations of FIGS. 5A and 5B may also include the safety features provided by the transistors <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> as described above in connection with the operation of FIG. 3. </p><p>[0050] Reference is now made to FIG. 6 wherein there is shown a specific circuit implementation for the generic representation of circuit <b>100</b> as illustrated in FIG. 5A. Again, common reference numbers are used in FIG. 6 to refer to common components with other FIGURES and no further discussion of these common components, except to the extent necessary to explain operation of the circuit <b>100</b>, will be provided. The generator <b>204</b> comprises a set of series, diode connected, N type transistors <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b>. The current source <b>208</b> comprises an N type transistor <b>24</b> whose drain is connected to the source of transistor <b>15</b><i>c</i>, whose source is connected to ground, and whose gate is connected to the gate of transistor <b>16</b><i>a </i>in the generator <b>204</b>. It should be noted that the implementation of FIG. 6 differs from the implementation of FIG. 3 in that transistors <b>14</b><i>b </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>are not utilized. </p><p>[0051] It is further recognized that other alternative embodiments of the circuit <b>100</b> may be constructed as shown in FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b>. Each of these embodiments, generally speaking, operate in the same manner as the circuit <b>100</b> illustrated in FIGS. 3, 5 and <b>6</b>, and described above. More specifically, FIG. 7 shows the circuit <b>100</b> similar to that of FIG. 3, except without use of transistors <b>14</b><i>b </i>and <b>15</b><i>b</i>. FIG. 8 shows the circuit <b>102</b> in an implementation similar to that of FIG. 7 except that the depletion and enhancement mode devices in the series connected stack formed by transistors <b>16</b><i>b </i>and <b>17</b> have exchanged places (see, transistors <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>) and the transistors <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>a </i>have been replaced by an N type transistor current source <b>30</b> connected in a current mirror configuration with the transistor <b>26</b>. FIG. 9 shows the circuit <b>102</b> in an implementation similar to that of FIG. 3 except that the current mirror (provided by transistors <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>) is formed with depletion mode devices. FIG. 10 shows the circuit <b>100</b> with the current mirror orientation exchanged around and formed with depletion mode devices. It will, of course, be understood that enhancement mode devices could also be used. </p><p>[0052] With the use of the circuits described herein, the supplied current driver operates in a class AB manner to allow high current upon demand to the capacitive load of the output line upon demand while still allowing for a low quiescent current. This is facilitated due to the fact that the included source follower circuit does not have an intentionally included (for example, separately supplied) resistive element in its drain circuit. In the circuit configuration(s), responsive to the applied control signal, the driver is either activated or deactivated, and when activated the capacitive output line is driven with the current towards the bias voltage with a current greater than its quiescent value in order to achieve a more rapid biasing. When deactivated, on the other hand, the bias driver consumes substantially zero power. </p><p>[0053] Although preferred embodiments of the method and apparatus of the present invention have been illustrated in the accompanying Drawings and described in the foregoing Detailed Description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications and substitutions without departing from the spirit of the invention as set forth and defined by the following claims. </p></description><claims load-source="us" status="new" lang="EN"><claim-statement>What is claimed is: </claim-statement><claim id="US-20030001662-A1-CLM-00001" num="1"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
