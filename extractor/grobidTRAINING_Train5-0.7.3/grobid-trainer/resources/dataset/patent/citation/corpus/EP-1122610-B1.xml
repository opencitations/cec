a method of replenishing a replenisher
for developer for automatic developing apparatuses, and, in particular, to
such a method as to minimize the fluctuation of developer
sensitivity due to changes in developing conditions.</p><heading>2. <u style="single">Description of the Related Art</u></heading><p num="0002">In general, as a representative method of controlling
the developer sensitivity in an automatic developing
apparatus for photosensitive lithographic printing plates,
there is adopted a method replenishing a replenisher for
developer (hereinafter, just referred to as &quot;replenisher&quot;)
with time and processing, which replenishes the replenisher
with time to a developer tank that a developer is stored,
measures the plate area of the processed plates, and
replenishes an amount of the replenisher corresponding to
the measured value (hereinafter, referred to as &quot;plate
area-based replenishing method&quot;).</p><p num="0003">However, the plate area-based replenishing method 
requires a device for measuring a plate area of the
lithographic plate in a developing part of the automatic
developing apparatus, thus causing the structure of the
developing apparatus complicated and expensive.</p><p num="0004">Further, it is difficult to judge whether a single
surface or the both surfaces of the lithographic plate are
processed, (hereinafter, referred to as &quot;single
surface/dual surface&quot;.) and the type of plate (note that
there are various kinds of plates differing in coated amount
of the photosensitive layer). Thus, in case that the
appropriate replenisher amount will change depending on the
plate area, the single surface/dual surface, and the type
of plate, there is a problem that it makes difficult to
appropriately replenish the replenisher.</p><p num="0005">On the other hand, there is conventionally disclosed
in <ref typ="patent">JP-A-64-21451</ref> (the term &quot;JP-A&quot; as used herein means a
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication), a method
replenishing the replenisher for an automatic developing
apparatus for photosensitive lithographic printing plates,
which measures the electric conductivity of the developer,
compares the measured value with the calculated value that
has been experimentally determined for the optimum
sensitivity, and replenishes the replenisher in the case
where the measured value is smaller than the calculated value.
(Hereinafter, this method will be referred to as 
&quot;conductivity-based replenishing method&quot;.)</p><p num="0006">The conductivity-based replenishing method can
replenish the appropriate amount of the replenisher and can
appropriately keep the developer sensitivity, even with the
changes in plate area, single surface/dual surface, or type
of lithographic plate to be processed.</p><p num="0007">However, it should be noted that the developer
conductivity is affected (rises) by natural evaporation of
water from the developer. Accordingly, when natural
evaporation of water is promoted due to the affect of the
installed conditions of the automatic developing apparatus
or the like, an appropriate replenishing amount of the
replenisher will be changed.</p><p num="0008">The aforementioned conductivity-based replenishing
method cannot deal with the changes of the appropriate
replenishing amount of the replenisher due to the natural
evaporation of water. Thus, when the natural evaporation
of water is increased, the appropriate replenishment is not
realized, thus failing in keeping the developer sensitivity
appropriately.</p><p num="0009">Moreover, the electric conductivity of the developer
exhausted by carbon dioxide absorbed in elapsed time differs
from that of the one exhausted by plate processing when the
sensitivity of the two are recovered to their proper values.
For example, a silicate-type processing agent exhibits 
65mS/cm when recovered from CO<sub>2</sub> fatigue in contrast to
55mS/cm when recovered from plate processing, and a non-silicate-type
processing agent exhibits 56mS/cm when
recovered from CO<sub>2</sub> fatigue in contrast to 39mS/cm when
recovered from plate processing. Therefore, if the
frequency of processing, e.g., the processed amount per day
changes, the electric conductivity for its optimal
sensitivity tends to shift from the reference conductivity
value set up in advance, thus it becomes impossible to keep
the developer sensitivity appropriately.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0010">By taking into account those situations described
above, the object of the present invention is to provide
a method of replenishing
the replenisher for automatic developing apparatuses, which can minimize the
fluctuation of developing sensitivity against the changes
in developing conditions, while using an economic and simple
developing unit of the automatic developing apparatus, to
thereby perform a stable development.</p><p num="0011">The purpose of the present invention can be achieved
with the following methods. <sl><li>(1) A method for replenishing developing fluid in an
automatic developing apparatus for photosensitive
materials, comprising the steps of:
<sl><li>a) replenishing the developing fluid based on a
first predetermined replenishing condition to
compensate for the reduction of developing activity
of the developing fluid over time due to its
reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide;</li><li>b) replenishing the developing fluid based on a
second predetermined replenishing condition to
compensate for the reduction of the activity of the
developing fluid caused by the processing of
photosensitive materials;</li><li>c) measuring the electric conductivity of the
replenished developing fluid;</li><li>d) calculating a replenisher replacement ratio
which reflects the extent to which the developing
fluid is replaced by at least one of the
replenishing fluid and a diluent for reducing the
electric conductivity of the developing fluid; and</li><li>e) supplying a diluent to the developing fluid
until the electric conductivity of the developing
fluid falls below an electric conductivity target
value calculated from the replenisher replacement
ratio if the measured value of the electric
conductivity of the developer exceeds the electric
conductivity target value.</li></sl></li><li>(2) A method according to (1), wherein the electric
conductivity target value is calculated from the
replenisher replacement ratio and either:
<sl><li>a) a dilution ratio which is the sum of the volume
of diluent used for diluting the replenishing fluid
and the volume of diluent supplied to the developer
tank in order to lower the electric conductivity of
the developing fluid, with respect to the volume of
the replenishing fluid; or</li><li>b) a ratio of the integral amount of the
replenishing fluid which is supplied to the
developer tank to compensate for the reduction of
the developing activity of the developing fluid due
to its reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide over
time, with respect to the product of the replenisher
replacement ratio and the volume of the developer.</li></sl></li></sl></p><p num="0012">In the present invention, the &quot;replenisher for
developer&quot; represents a processing solution to be 
replenished for maintaining a constant developing
performance. The replenisher for developer includes a
solution regulated by diluting an undiluted replenisher with
a diluent such as water, or a replenisher which can use
without dilution as it is. Further, as to a replenishing
method, the replenisher regulated by previously diluting the
undiluted replenisher may be replenished to the developer
tank, or the undiluted replenisher and the diluent may be
directly replenished to the developer tank. In addition,
when using the undiluted replenisher and the diluent, the
integral amount of the replenisher is obtained by the sum
of the undiluted replenisher and the diluent.</p><p num="0013">In the present invention, the electric conductivity of the
developer can be measured with any device well known in the art,
including an AC conductivity meter, an AC bridge meter and other
types of conductivity meters.</p><p num="0014">In addition, although an optimal condition of a measured
current value and an oscillating frequency or the like of the
measuring device depends on compositions of the developer and the
like, but from the viewpoints of device protection and preventing
the electrolysis of the aqueous developer, it is preferable that
the current value makes low to some extent, that is, from several
hundred mA to several µA.</p><p num="0015">Further, from the viewpoints of the electrostatic capacity
component of the developer, it is preferable that the frequency 
is from several hundred Hz to several hundred kHz.</p><p num="0016">The electric conductivity of the developer containing
electrolytes depends on the temperature of the aqueous solution,
and the electric conductivity decreases as the temperature rises.
Hence, it is more preferable to measure the electric conductivity
with a measuring device equipped with a temperature sensor and a
temperature compensating circuit. Further, the controller for
replenishment can compensate the temperature by converting an
actually measured liquid resistance value and liquid temperature
into the electric conductivity value at the predetermined
temperature.</p><p num="0017">The sensor of the AC conductivity meter, the AC bridge meter,
or other types of conductivity meters may be placed at any place
where the sensor can be immersed in the developer at the measuring
time and can measures its AC conductivity value of the developer.
Preferably, the sensor can be placed inside the developer
circulation system of the automatic developing apparatus,
particularly, in the developer tank or in the circulation pipe.</p><p num="0018">As the detecting device, a well-known measuring cell
containing electrodes made of platinum, stainless steel, or the
like can be used.</p><p num="0019">Next, a description will be given of a developer and
a replenisher applicable to the present invention.</p><heading>1. Developer</heading><heading>[Alkali agent]</heading><p num="0020">The developer and the replenisher used in the present
invention is aqueous alkaline solution with pH 9.0-13.5, and

silicon dioxide SiO<sub>2</sub> to alkaline metal oxide M<sub>2</sub>O both of which
constitute these salts as well as the concentration can
control the pH as well as the developing activity. In 
general, the silicate composition is expressed by the molar
ratio of SiO<sub>2</sub> to M<sub>2</sub>O ([SiO<sub>2</sub>]/[M<sub>2</sub>O]). For example, an aqueous
solution of potassium silicate having a molar ratio of SiO<sub>2</sub>
to M<sub>2</sub>O of 0.5-2.0(i.e., [SiO<sub>2</sub>]/[M<sub>2</sub>O] = 0.5-2.0), and the
content of SiO<sub>2</sub> in said solution being 1-4 % by weight, is

acid, 2-hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid, 1- and 2-naphthoic acid,
etc. Among these, hydroxynaphthoic acid is one of the most
suitable aromatic acids.</p><p num="0040">The above described aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic
acids can be preferably used in the form of sodium, potassium
or ammonium salt to secure a high solubility to water. There
is no special limitation on the content of organic carboxylic
acid in the developer composition of the present invention,
but, in general, contents below 0.1% by weight cannot exert
a sufficient effect; on the other hand,when the acid content
exceeds 10% by weight, the effect is saturated, and tends
to hinder the solution of other additives. Accordingly, the
practical range lies between 0.1 and 10% and more preferably
0.5 and 4% by weight of the working developer.</p><heading>[Antiseptic]</heading><p num="0041">Antiseptics can be added to the developer, washing
water or finishing liquid. Known antiseptics for fabric,
wood processing, food, cosmetic, agricultural chemical, etc.
can be used. Examples include quaternary ammonium salts,
monovalent, bivalent or polyvalent phenol derivatives,
imidazole derivatives, pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives, 
monovalent naphthol, carbonates, sulfone derivatives,
organic tin compound, cyclopentane derivatives, phenyl
derivatives, phenol ether derivatives, phenol ester
derivatives, hydroxylamine derivatives, nitrile
derivatives; naphthalines, pyrrole derivatives, quinoline
derivatives, benzothiazole derivatives, secondary amines,
1,3,5-triazine derivatives, thiadiazole derivatives,
anilide derivatives, pyrrole derivatives, halogen
derivatives, dihydric alcohol derivatives, dithiols, cyanic
acid derivatives, thiocarbamide derivatives, diamine
derivatives, isothiazole derivatives, monohydric alcohols,
saturated aldehydes, unsaturated monocarboxylic acids,
saturated and unsaturated ethers, lactones, amino acid
derivatives, hydantoins, cyanuric acid derivatives,
guanidine derivatives, pyridine derivatives, saturated
monocarboxylic acids, benzenecarboxylic acid derivatives,
hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives, biphenyl, hydroxamic
acid derivatives, aromatic alcohols, halogenophenol
derivatives, benzenecarboxylic acid derivatives,
mercaptocarboxylic acid derivatives, quaternary ammonium
salt derivatives, triphenylmethane derivatives, hinokitiol,
furan and benzofuran derivatives, acridine derivatives,
isoquinoline derivatives, arsine derivatives, thiocarbamic
acid derivatives, phosphoric acid esters, halogenated
benzene derivatives, quinone derivatives, benzenesulfonic 
acid derivatives, monoamine derivatives, organic phosphoric
acid esters, piperadine derivatives, phenazine derivative,
pyrimidine derivatives, thiophanate derivatives,
imidazoline derivatives, isoxazole derivatives, ammonium
salt derivatives, et. Particularly suited anticeptics are
the salts of pyridinethiol-1-oxide, salicylic acid and its
salts, 1,3,5-trishydroxyethylhexahydro-S-triazine,
1,3,5-trishydroxymethylhexahydro-S-triazine, 1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one,
5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one
and 2-bromo-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol.
The addition levels of these antiseptics are determined so
as for the antiseptics to work in a stable and effective
manner against bacteria, mold, yeast fungi, etc., depending
on the kinds of bacteria, etc. A preferable range is usually
0.01-4% by weight. In general, combined two or more kinds
of antiseptics are preferably used together to protect the
developer from various kinds of bacteria, mold, etc.</p><heading>[Other ingredients]</heading><p num="0042">The developer and replenisher compositions used in the
present invention can further contain still other
ingredients such as anti-forming agent, water softener, etc.,
depending on the need. Softeners for hard water include,
for example, polyphosphoric acid and its sodium, potassium
or ammonium salt, amino-polycarboxylic acid such as
ethylenediamineteteraacetic acid, 
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid,
triethylenetetraminehexaacetic acid,
hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid,
nitrylotriacetic acid, 1,2-diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic
acid, 1,3-diamino-2-propanol tetraacetic acid, etc., sodium,
potassium or ammonium salt of the amino-polycarboxylic acids
described above, aminotri(methylene phosphonic acid),
ethylenediamine-tetra(methylene phosphonic acid),
diethylenetriaminepenta(methylene phosphonic acid),
triethylenetetraminehexa(methylene phosphonic acid),
hydroxyethylethylene-diaminetri(methylene phosphonic
acid) and 1-hydroxyethane-1,1-diphosphonic acid and sodium,
potassium or ammonium salt of the phosphonic acids cited
above.</p><p num="0043">A preferable range for the concentration of such a
softener depends on its chelating capability as well as the
hardness of the water in concern; generally speaking, based
on the working developer, 0.01-5% by weight and more
preferably 0.01-0.5% by weight is recommended. Lower
concentration levels than the described range fail to exert
a sufficient softening effect; on the other hand, higher
addition levels tend to have adverse effects on developed
images such as density drop, etc.</p><p num="0044">The remaining part of the developer and the replenisher
consists of water, to which still various additives known 
in the art can be added.</p><p num="0045">From the viewpoint of the transportation, the
developer and the replenisher of the present invention take
a condensed form in which they have an increased
concentration of ingredients to be diluted with water in use.
The degree of condensation is determined so as to cause
neither phase separation nor deposition of the ingredients.</p><p num="0046">The temperature of the developer should be kept at 15-40°C,
and more preferably 20-35°C. The developing time is
preferably 5-60sec, and more preferably 7-40sec.</p><p num="0047">The method of the invention can be applied not only to the
above-cited developers, but also to those described in <ref typ="patent">EP0836120A1</ref>,

used in the present invention will be described.</p><p num="0049">A type of positive-working image recording material
is proposed in <ref typ="patent">JP-A-7-285275</ref>, <ref typ="patent">JP-A-11-119419</ref> and <ref typ="patent">Japanese
Patent Application 11-182751</ref> in which the material can
record images via an infrared laser exposure. The
photosensitive material consists of a binding agent such as
cresol resin, a substance that generates heat by absorbing
light, and another substance that is thermally decomposable
such as quinonnediazide and which substantially prevents
said binding agent from dissolving in the developer when not 
decomposed. In such a positive-working material, at
exposed areas, the substance generating head by absorbing
light generates head, thus causing the exposed areas to
dissolve.</p><p num="0050">Furthermore, <ref typ="patent">JP-A-7-20625</ref>, <ref typ="patent">JP-A-11-218903</ref>, <ref typ="patent">Japanese
patent application Nos. 11-308286 and 11-332936</ref> disclose a
type of negative-working image recording material
comprising a compound that generates acid upon the
decomposition by light or heat, a cross-linking agent that
works by the presence of acid, at least one kind of
alkali-soluble resin, and an infrared light absorbing agent.
In such a negative-working image recording material, at
exposed areas, the substance generates heat by absorbing
light, the above compound generates acid by decomposing by
the heat, and the acid thus formed promotes the cross-linking
of the alkali-soluble resin with the cross-linking agent,
to thereby perform an image recording.</p><p num="0051">The present invention can use such image recording
materials described above as a lithographic printing plate.
To form lithographic printing plates, the image recording
on lithographic printing plates is performed by an infrared
laser exposure, which are subjected to heat treatment, if
needed, and then to perform a development proceeding.</p><p num="0052">The present invention is also applicable to the
processing of the photosensitive lithographic printing 
plates based on the photopolymer compositions as disclosed
in <ref typ="patent">Japanese Patent Application Hei.10-251521</ref>, <ref typ="patent">JP-A-2000-39724</ref>
and <ref typ="patent">Japanese Patent Application 2000-276811</ref>. The
photosensitive lithographic printing plates based on the
photopolymer compositions consist of, on a substrate that
an aluminum plate is subjected to a hydrophilic proceeding,
a photo-polymerizable layer containing a compound having an
ethylenic double bond capable of addition polymerization and
a polymer having a cross-linkable group in its side chain.
In the present invention, such a type of lithographic plate
is exposed imagewise with laser light and then is developed.</p><p num="0053">The present invention is also applicable to the
processing of the positive-working photosensitive
lithographic printing plates disclosed in <ref typ="patent">JP-A-9-274324</ref>,
<ref typ="patent">JP-A-2000-231188</ref> and <ref typ="patent">Japanese Patent Application
No.2000-13656</ref>, having been in a wide use in the conventional
art. This type of lithographic plate consists of an aluminum
plate as a support body on which a photosensitive layer
containing an o-quinonediazide compound. O-quinonediazide
compounds are known to be converted to carboxylic acids by
UV exposure, thus the layer can be developed with an aqueous
alkaline solution to cause a removal of the exposed areas
of the photosensitive layer, whereby the support body
surface is exposed. The exposed support surface of the
aluminum support body, which is hydrophilic, at the exposed 
(non-image portion) areas holds water by the development and
repels oil based ink on the printer. On the other hand, the
image areas where the photosensitive layer remains accept
oil based ink and repels water. Usually, in the
photosensitive layer of such positive-working type
lithographic plates is incorporated a cresol-novolac resin
as the binder for the o-quinonediazide compound. The method
of the present invention is applicable to the proceeding of
the negative-working photosensitive lithographic plate,
which is disclosed in <ref typ="patent">JP-A-7-295212</ref> and <ref typ="patent">Japanese Patent

developing apparatuses which may be used in the
methods
of the present invention with reference to the
attached figures.</p><p num="0056">As shown in Fig. 1, an automatic developing apparatus
2 includes a developing unit 6 which develops photosensitive
lithographic printing plates (hereinafter, referred to as
&quot;PS plates&quot;) 4, a finishing unit 8 which first washes off
the developer adhered to the developed PS plate 4 and which
then coats a gum solution thereon, and a drying unit 10 which
dries the PS plate coated with the gum solution.</p><p num="0057">When the PS plate 4 that requires pre-heating prior to
development are processed, a pre-heating unit (not shown in Fig.
1) can be provided. The pre-heating unit is arranged at the
upstream side of the developing unit 6 along the transport direction,
and has a function of keeping the surface temperature of the PS
plate 4 during a predetermined period while the PS plate 4 is
transported. The PS plate 4 inserted into the pre-heating unit
is automatically transported along with the application of heat
toward the next processing.</p><p num="0058">Further, the developing apparatus 2 may include a
pre-washing unit (not shown in Fig. 1). The pre-washing unit
is arranged at the upstream side of the developing unit 6
and at the downstream side of the pre-heating unit along the
transport direction. The pre-washing unit has a function of
washing and cooling the surface of the PS plate 4 by washing
water while transporting the PS plate 4. The PS plate 4 
inserted into the pre-washing unit is transported towards the
developing unit 6 that carries out the next processing.</p><p num="0059">An insert port 14 is formed in a sidewall 12 of the
automatic developing apparatus 2, and the PS plate 4 inserted
from the insert port 14 is sent to the developing unit 6 by
transport rollers 16. At the insert port 14, there is
provided a rubber blade 18 that closes the insert port 14
except when a PS plate 4 is being inserted.</p><p num="0060">In a developer tank 20 of the developing unit 6,
transport rollers 22, brush rollers 24 and squeeze rollers
26 are equipped in this order from the upstream side in the
transporting direction, and backup rollers 28 are also
equipped between the former three rollers in an appropriate
manner. The PS plate 4 is immersed in and developed by the
developer solution while being transported by the transport
roller 22.</p><p num="0061">The finishing unit 8 contiguous to the developing unit
6 includes a first finishing unit 8a and a second finishing
unit 8b. Each of these finishing units 8a, 8b is equipped
with transport rollers 30a, 30b transporting the PS plate
4, nozzles 34a, 34b that spray the gum solution stored in
finishing tank 32a, 32b onto the PS plate 4. The PS plate
4 after the development is coated with the gum solution by
the nozzles 34a, 34b while being transported by the transport
rollers 30a, 30b. The gum solution stored in the second 
finishing tank 32b of the second finishing unit 8b located
at the downstream side is overflowed to be supplied to the
first finishing tank 32a of the first finishing unit 8a. In
stead of this structure, the gum solution may be supplied
from the second finishing tank 32b to the first finishing
tank 32a with using a pump or the like.</p><p num="0062">The drying unit 10 contiguous to the finishing unit
8 is equipped with a guide roller 36 and a pair of rollers
with skewers 38 in this order from the upstream side in the
transporting direction. In the drying unit 10, there is
equipped a drying device such as a warm-air supplying unit,
a heating unit, etc. not shown in the figure. In the drying
unit 10 there is a discharge port 40, through which the dried
PS plate 4 is discharged out of the apparatus. Further, a
shutter 44 is provided in a passage 46 between the drying
unit 10 and the finishing unit 8, and the shutter 44 is kept
the passage 46 closed except when the PS plate 4 is moving
along the passage 46.</p><p num="0063">To the second finishing tank 32b, the gum solution
stored in a gum solution tank 56 is fed by a pump 77, and
a diluent (water) 57 stored in a diluent for replenishment
storage tank 53 is also fed by a diluent for replenishment
supplying pump 78. Here, the replenishing amount of the gum
solution to that of the diluent is 1:1. Along with such
replenishment, the gum waste solution overflowed from the 
first finisher tank 32a is collected to the waste tank 54
as well as the developer waste solution</p><p num="0064">In a developer tank 20, a box-shaped shielding cover
60 is provided integrally with the tank walls. The bottom
wall of the shielding cover 60 is structured to have plural
curved depressions so as not to touch with upper
circumferential surfaces of the rollers 22, 24 and 28.</p><p num="0065">As the shielding cover 60 is of box-shape, an airtight
space is formed above the developer tank 20, and thus the
amount of air in the developing unit 6 is minimized. Further,
owing to the presence of the shielding cover 60, the area
of the developer directly contacted with the air is made as
small as possible.</p><p num="0066">In the automatic developing apparatus 2 described
heretofore, plural rubber blades 62 are provided at proper
places in such a manner that a substantially airtight space
is formed from the developing unit 6 to the second finishing
unit 8b by preventing the external atmosphere from entering
inside. The space between the developing unit 6 and the
first finishing unit 8a is also airtightly formed by the
rubber blade 62 so as to prevent the air in first finisher
8a from flowing into the developing unit 6. Thus, the
developing unit 6 is substantially airtight except the
period of the passage of the PS plate 4 through the insert
port, which the air is slightly entered. </p><p num="0067">Now, the developing unit 6 will be described more in
detail. To the developer tank 20 is connected a circulation
pipe 80 of the developer, in which are installed a developer
circulation pump 71, a conductivity sensor 73 and a filter
(not shown).</p><p num="0068">The developer circulation pump 71 sucks the developer
in the tank 20 through the hole provided in the bottom of
the tank 20 into the pipe 80, puts the developer into
circulation, and again ejects the developer back into the
tank 20. The filter filters the developer flowing through
the pipe 80. The conductivity sensor 73 measures the
conductivity of the developer passing through the pipe 80.</p><p num="0069">Moreover, the developing unit 6 is equipped with a
replenishing device comprising replenishing pipes 90 and 91,
an undiluted replenisher storage tank 55 connected to the
replenishing pipe 90, an undiluted replenisher supplying
pump 74 intervened in the replenishing pipe 90, the diluent
for replenishment storage tank 53 connected to the
replenishing pipe 91, and a diluent for replenishment
supplying pipe 76 intervened in the replenishing pipe 91.
The developing waste solution which overflows the developer
tank 20 is collected in the waste tank 54.</p><p num="0070">Specifically, close to the developer tank 20 are
provided the pair of pipes 90 and 91 that supply the
replenisher obtained by diluting the undiluted replenisher 
58 with the diluent for replenishment 57. The replenishing
pipe 90 for the undiluted replenisher 58 is connected to the
undiluted replenisher storage tank 55 (at the bottom left
in Fig. 1). The undiluted replenisher supplying pump 74 is
involved in the pipe 90, and supplies the undiluted
replenisher 58 from the undiluted replenisher storage tank
55 to the developer tank 20.</p><p num="0071">The replenishing pipe 91 for the diluent for
replenishment 57 is connected to the diluent storage tank
53 (at the bottom middle in Fig. 1). The diluent supplying
pump 76 is involved in the replenishing pipe 91, and supplies
the diluent for replenishment (water) 57 from the diluent
storage tank 53 to the developer tank 20. In other words,
the replenishing pipe 91, the diluent for replenishment
supplying pump 76 and the diluent storage tank 53 constitute
a diluent supplying system.</p><p num="0072">Both of the undiluted replenisher supplying pump 74
and the diluent for replenishment supplying pump 76 are
controlled by a controlling ROM 51 being a condition
memorizing unit and a controller 50 comprising a time
measuring device 52, wherein the former 74 is controlled
based on signals from a plate detector 27 and a time measuring
device 52 while the latter 76 is controlled based on signals
from the plate detector 27, the time measuring device 52 and
the conductivity sensor 73. </p><p num="0073">The controller 50 controls the undiluted replenisher
supplying pump 74 and the diluent supplying pump 76 based
on the signals from the plate detector 27 which can judge
whether a plate is being processed or not and which can
measure the area, etc. of the transported plate, and carries
out the replenishment referring to the replenishing
conditions established according to the actual operating
conditions of the automatic developing apparatus 2 and
memorized in the controlling ROM 51. Thus, as an example,
the controller 50 supplies the amount of the replenisher for
developer (the sum of the undiluted replenisher 58 and the
diluent for replenishment 57) corresponding to the
replenishing condition from the undiluted replenisher
storage tank 55 and the diluent for replenishment storage
tank 53 after processing every plate. Alternatively, the
replenishment may be performed after processing a fixed
plural number of plates, not every plate.</p><p num="0074">Further, the controller 50 carries out the
replenishment when the time measuring device 52 detects the
elapse of a predetermined time, referring to the
replenishing conditions established according to the actual
operating conditions of automatic developing apparatus 2.
The controller 50 supplies the amount of the replenisher for
developer (the sum of undiluted replenisher 58 and the
diluent for replenishment 57) corresponding to the 
replenishing condition memorized in the controlling ROM 51
from the undiluted replenisher storage tank 55 and the
diluent storage tank 53 coping with the effect of time
elapse.</p><p num="0075">Further, when the conductivity of the replenished
developer measured by the sensor 73 exceeds the target value
(corresponding to the desirable state of the developer)
calculated from the replacement ratio of the replenisher,
etc., the controller 50 supplies the diluent for
replenishment 57 to developer tank 20 from the diluent
storage tank 53.</p><p num="0076">Next, a description will be given of an operation of
the present embodiment.</p><p num="0077">During the operation of the automatic developing
apparatus 2, the undiluted replenisher supplying pump 74 and
the diluent for replenishment supplying pump 76 are
controlled by the controller 50 on the basis of the signals
from the time measuring device 52 and the plate detector 27
with reference to the predetermined replenishing conditions
depending on actual operating conditions, whereby the
replenisher is supplied to the developer tank 20 by the two
pumps to compensate the effects of time elapse as well as
processing.</p><p num="0078">Further, by controlling the diluent supplying pump 76
by the controller 50 based on the signals from the 
conductivity sensor 73, the diluent is replenished to the
developer tank 20 from the diluent storage tank 53 until the
conductivity of the developer replenished with the
replenisher becomes below the predetermined target value.</p><p num="0079">A description will be given of a control of the
controller 50 with reference to Fig. 2.</p><p num="0080">First of all, at step S1, the replenishment of the
replenisher is carried out with a lapse of time and at every
processing in the predetermined condition, based on the
replenishing conditions (memorized in controlling ROM 51)
predetermined depending on the actual operating conditions
of the automatic developing apparatus 2.</p><p num="0081">Then, at step S2, the target value of conductivity is
calculated from the replacement ratio of the replenisher
defined by a ratio that the charged developer at the start
of the developing processing is replaced with the
replenisher and/or the diluent replenished to lower the
conductivity of the developer.</p><p num="0082">The mathematical formulae for the calculation of the
target conductivity value are as follows. By using various
values defined as follows;
<sl><li>Vt: the volume of the developer present in the developer
tank,</li><li>Vwi: the volume of the diluent for diluting the
replenisher replenished to compensate the fatigue caused by 
aging and/or by plate processing, and/or the volume of the
diluent replenished to lower the conductivity of the
developer,</li><li>Vhi: the volume of the undiluted replenisher
replenished to compensate the fatigue caused by aging and/or
by plate processing,</li><li>Vhc: the volume of the replenisher added to compensate
the fatigue caused by aging,</li><li>Vhd: the volume of the replenisher replenished to
compensate the fatigue caused by plate processing,</li><li>X<sub>n</sub>: the replacement ratio of the replenisher,</li><li>Z<sub>n</sub>: the replenisher dilution ratio being a ratio that
the diluent for replenishment and/or the diluent replenished
to lower the developer conductivity is included in the

be explained. Fig. 3 shows the structure of the automatic
developing apparatus of the second embodiment of the
invention.</p><p num="0088">In an automatic developing apparatus 100 of the present
embodiment, processing units inside thereof are covered with
outer panels 114. Inside of the outer panels 114, there are 
arranged a developing unit 122 including a developer tank
118 for developing a PS plate 112 and an overflow pipe 120
which collects the developer overflowed from the developer
tank 118, a water washing unit 124 which washes off the
developer adhered to the PS plate 112 and a finishing unit
126 which desensitizes the washed PS plate 112 by coating
a gum solution. The washing unit 124 has a washing water
tank 128, and the finishing unit 126 has a gum solution tank
130.</p><p num="0089">In the outer panel 114, there are provided a slit-shaped
insert port 202 and a slit-shaped discharge port 204.
In the upper plane of panel 114, there is provided an insert
port for reentry 250 (sub insert port) for the insertion of
the PS plate 112 between the developing unit 122 and the
washing unit 124. This sub insert port 250 is used to perform
the other processing than development on the PS plate 112.</p><p num="0090">At the sub insert port 250, there is a blade 252, the
leading edge of which is in contact with the outer panel 114
acting as a guiding support surface for the sub insert port
250. On the other hand, the base portion of the blade 252
is fixed to the rear side of outer panel 114 through an
intervening bracket 254. With such a structure, the sub
insert port 250 is usually kept in a closed state by the blade
252.</p><p num="0091">The drying unit (not shown) dries the PS plate 112 by 
blowing a warm air to the both surfaces thereof while
transporting by plural rollers (not shown) the PS plate 112
sent from finishing unit 126.</p><p num="0092">A pair of transport rollers 132 are equipped at the
insertion side of the PS plate 112 to the developer tank 118
in the developing unit 122. The PS plate 112 is inserted
from the insert port 202 between the pair of transport
rollers 132.</p><p num="0093">A rubber blade 206 is provided at the downstream side
of and close to the transport roller 132. The leading edge
of the blade 206 is in contact with the sidewall of the
developer tank 118 of the developing unit 122, and its base
portion is attached to the outer panel 114 through a bracket
256. The bracket 256 includes a fixed part 256A and a sliding
part 256B attached to the fixed part 256A with a wing nut
258, and the blade 206 is fixed to the sliding part 256B.
Thus, the blade 206 is so constructed that its leading edge
can be separated from the sidewall of the developer tank 118
by moving the sliding part 256B relative to the fixed part
256A with the wing nut 258 loosened.</p><p num="0094">Further, in the vicinity of the insert port 102, a plate
detector 208 is equipped which detects whether the PS plate
112 is passing or not and which also can measure the area
of the plate, etc.</p><p num="0095">The developer tank 118 has a cross-sectional shape of 
a substantially inverted mountain, the top of the tank 118
is open and the center portion of the bottom thereof
protrudes downward. The tank 118 has a pump 260 that sucks
the developer in the tank 118 and blows out it from spray
pipes 144 and 272 that will be described later, whereby the
developer stored in the developer tank 118 is circulated.
During the circulation, the flowing developer passes through
a conductivity sensor 262 which measures a conductivity of
the developer. Further, the undiluted replenisher is
supplied from an undiluted replenisher storage tank 266 to
developer tank 118 by a pump 264. As will be described later,
a diluting water is also supplied from the water tank 128
to the developer tank 118 by a pump 286.</p><p num="0096">Both of the pumps 264 and 286 are controlled by the
controller 50 comprising the controlling ROM 51 being a
condition memorizing unit and a time measuring device 52
whereby the former 264 is controlled based on signals from
the plate detector 208 and the time measuring device 52,
while the latter 286 is controlled based on signals from the
plate detector 208, the time measuring device 52 and the
conductivity sensor 262. Detailed descriptions on the
operations and effects of the controller 50 which are similar
to those in the first embodiment are omitted.</p><p num="0097">In the developer tank 118, there are arranged a guide
plate 268 in the upstream side, and plural guide rollers 134 
and a rotary brush roller 270 in the downstream side. These
guide rollers 134 and rotary brush roller 270 are bridged
over the pair of the sidewalls of the tank 118 in a revolvable
manner.</p><p num="0098">A guide roller 136 of a relatively large diameter is
arranged above the guide plate 268, and rotary brush rollers
138 and 270, and guide roller 140 are arranged above the guide
roller 134. In the center portion of the tank 118, a pair
of squeeze rollers 142 is provided which squeezes the surface
of the PS plate 112.</p><p num="0099">The overflow pipe 120 is arranged at the most downstream
side of tank 118. The overflow pipe 120 conducts the
developer to a waste tank 284 when the liquid surface of the
developer exceeds a predetermined level.</p><p num="0100">A liquid cover is disposed on the surface of the
developer in the developer tank 118. The liquid cover 150
has an arc-shaped projected part corresponding to the brush
roller 138 and the guide roller 140 contiguous to the roller
138. The cover 150 is contacted with the liquid surface of
the developwer to prevent the developer from being directly
contacted with air, and is slidably held at its both edges
along the transport direction of the PS plate 112 by the
sidewalls (not shown) in such a manner as to permit a vertical
motion of the cover in accordance with changes of the level
of the liquid surface. </p><p num="0101">The downstream end of the liquid cover 150 along the
transport direction is in contact with the leading edge of
a blade 274 that is fixed to the outer panel 114 via a bracket
276. With the blade 274 thus structured, the liquid surface
of the developer exposed at the downstream end of the liquid
cover 150 in the transport direction is separated from the
upper portion of the liquid cover 150. Further, by the blade
206 in the vicinity of the insert port 202, the upper space
of the liquid cover 150 is perfectly separated from the
external atmosphere, to thereby prevent the evaporation of
the developer. Note that each side end of the blade 206 is
in a tight contact with the sidewall of developer tank 118.</p><p num="0102">At the most downstream side of the developer tank 118,
a pair of rollers 154 are arranged which holds and transports
the PS plate 112 while simultaneously squeezing the
developer from the surface of the PS plate 112.</p><p num="0103">The automatic developing apparatus 100 has the water
washing tank 128 of the water washing unit 124 at the
downstream side of the developing unit 122. Above the water
washing tank 128, two pairs of transport rollers 152 and 153
are placed.</p><p num="0104">The washing water tank 128 stores washing water used
to remove the developer from the PS plate 112 fed from the
developer tank 118. A spray pipe 156 is provided at the
upstream side of the top transport roller 153 and above the 
transport passage. The outer surface of the pipe 156 has
plural discharge holes communicating with the inside of the
pipe 156. The washing water dipped by the pump 280 from the
tank 278 is dropped from the spray pipe 156 on the top roller
of the transport rollers 153. With the rotation of the top
roller 153, the washing water readily spreads on and thus
effectively cleans the surface of plate 112.</p><p num="0105">The lower portion of the bottom transport roller 152
or 153 is immersed in the washing water stored in a pan 162.
The bottom roller pulls up the washing water so as to clean
the rear surface of plate 112, and prevent the dry-up of the
top roller 152 or 153.</p><p num="0106">The washing water spread laterally along the front
surface of plate 112 falls into the pan 162 from the both
side edges of the PS plate 112, and the washing water scooped
up from the pan 162 washes the rear surface of the PS plate
112. The water overflowed from pan 162 is conducted to the
water washing tank 128, in which an overflow pipe 282 is
equipped so as to collect the washing water of the volume
exceeding the predetermined liquid level to the waste tank
284.</p><p num="0107">The washing water tank 128 and the developer tank 118
are connected with each other via a pump 286, which may
conduct the wash water in the washing water tank 128 to the
developer tank 118 as the diluent for supplying the 
replenisher to the developer tank 118.</p><p num="0108">Above the gum solution tank 130 of the finishing unit
126, there is provided a pair of transport rollers 178. The
PS plate 112 fed from the transport roller 153 is guided to
the transport rollers 178.</p><p num="0109">At the upstream side of the transport rollers 178, there
are arranged a spray pipe 182 above the transport passage,
and another spray pipe 288 below the transport passage. Each
spray pipe sprays the gum solution scooped up by a pump 292
from a gum solution tank 290 onto the front or the rear surface
of the PS plate 112.</p><p num="0110">Along with the transport of the PS plate 112, the
transport rollers 178 squeezes the gum solution sprayed with
spray pipe 182 for the desensitization of the surface of the
PS plate 112. The gum solution squeezed off the surface of
the PS plate 112 is collected to the gum solution tank 130.
The gum solution in the tank 130 is circulated by the pump
294. The gum solution tank 130 is provided with an overflow
pipe 296, which acts to collect the gum solution of the volume
exceeding the predetermined liquid level to the waste tank
284.</p><p num="0111">The lower portion of the bottom transport roller 178
is immersed in the gum solution stored in the gum solution
tank 130, and the bottom transport roller 178 scoops up the
gum solution to coat the rear surface of the PS plate 112 
for desensitization. The gum solution carried by bottom
transport roller 178 is also transferred onto the top
transport roller 178, thus preventing the dry-up of the top
roller 178 and also the deposition of the solution
ingredients on the surface of the top roller 178.</p><p num="0112">The PS plate 112 that has been subjected to the
treatment in the finishing unit 126 is fed through the
discharge port 204 of a casing 200 to the drying unit (not
shown).</p><p num="0113">A lid body 210 serving as a shutter is provided at the
discharge port 204. The lid body is supported by a pivot
shaft 212, which can rotate with a driving means such as,
for example, a solenoid (not shown).</p><p num="0114">The pivot shaft 212 rotates in accordance with the
signal from the plate detector 208 located close to the
insert port 202 to detect the passage of the PS plate 112.
More specifically, the lid body 210 is retained at a
substantially horizontal position (an open condition of the
discharge port 204) during the period that the PS plate 112
is detected by the plate detecting sensor 208, and a
predetermined period after the detection of the PS plate 112,
and the lid body 210 is retained at a vertical position (a
closed condition of the discharge port 204) during the time
other than such period.</p><p num="0115">Hereinafter, a description will be given of the 
operation of this embodiment. First of all, processing
tanks such as the developer tank 118, the washing water tank
128, the gum solution tank 130, etc.; are covered with the
casing 200 comprising the outer panel 114 and the main box
108, etc. And, in a case that no PS plate 112 is being
processed in the automatic developing apparatus 100, the
insert port 202 is closed as the blade 206 is in contact with
the sidewall of the developer tank 118. On the other hand,
the discharge port 204 is also closed with the lid body 210
in the vertical position since the sensor 208 does not detect
the PS plate 112. Furthermore, the sub insert port 250 is
also closed with the blade 252, and the space above the liquid
surface cover 150 of the developing unit 122 is also closed
with the blades 206 and 276. Thus, the developer in the
developer tank 118, the washing water in the washing water
unit 124 and the gum solution in the finishing unit 126 are
well protected from the external atmosphere, and
substantially no deterioration of the processing solutions
due to CO<sub>2</sub> takes place. Since the decline of developing
capability caused by the aging fatigue is minimized in the
embodiment, the replenishing amount of the undiluted
replenisher in the developing unit 122 can be drastically
reduced. In particular, the liquid surface of the developer
in the developer tank 118 is covered with the liquid surface
cover 150, the contact -protecting effect of the developer 
with the external atmosphere is noticeable.</p><p num="0116">In order to minimize the contact of the developer with
the external atmosphere, it is preferable to make the opening
period of the lid body 210 as short as possible. Thus, it
is preferable to close the lid body 210 except during the
passage of PS plate. 112.</p><p num="0117">As the control of the controller 50 is performed in

Example 1 is almost equivalent to the conventional
conductivity-based replenishing method, but far better than
the conventional plate area-based replenishing method.</p><p num="0121">Further, with the replenishing method described in
Example 1 and the conventional conductivity-based
replenishing method, the fluctuation range of the pH

water in the developer was experimentally calculated.</p><p num="0122">An experimental condition was set so that water in the
developer naturally evaporates at 30mL/hour.</p><p num="0123">Table 2 shows that the replenishing method of Example
1 can suppress the maximum range of pH fluctuation far better
than the conventional, conductivity-based replenishing
method. The reason is as follows. In Example 1, since the 
diluent is replenished based on the detected electric
conductivity of the developer, even when an abnormal rise
of the conductivity by water evaporation is caused, the
fluctuation of the sensitivity can be reduced by
compensating the diluent fallen short by the natural
evaporation on the other hand, the conventional,
conductivity-based replenishing method stops the
replenishment of the replenisher as a result of a misjudging
that the sensitivity is high when the abnormal rise of
conductivity by water evaporation is caused. Such a
countermeasure leads to a decline of the sensitivity.</p><heading>[Example 2] (Processing with non-silicate type developer)

a width of 1030mm was continuously processed as follows.
<sl><li>(a) The surface of the aluminum plate was mechanically grained
with rotating nylon brush rollers under a continuous feeding of
a polishing slurry comprising a polishing agent (purmice) having
a specific gravity of 1.12 dispersed in water onto the plate surface.
The average particle size of the polishing agent was 40 to 45µm
with the maximum size of 200µm. The nylon brush consisted of 6-10
nylon, the hair length was 50mm and the hair diameter 0.3mm.
The hairs were planted into pits densely formed on the surface of
a 300mm stainless steel pipe. Three rotating brushes were used.
Two 200mm sustaining rollers lying beneath the brush were
separated by 300mm from each other. The brush roller was pressed
to the aluminum plate until the load of the brush rotating motor 
increased by 7kw from the load before the brush was brought into
contact with the plate. The brush was rotated in the same direction
as that of the plate transport at 200rpm.</li><li>(b) The aluminum plate was subjected to etching by spraying
an aqueous solution containing 2.6% by weight sodium hydroxide and
6.5% by weight of aluminum ion at 70°C until the plate was dissolved
by 13g/m<sup>2</sup>. Then, the etched plate was rinsed by spraying water.</li><li>(c) Next, desmutting treatment was carried out by spraying
an aqueous 1% by weight nitric acid solution containing 0.5% by
weight aluminum ion at 30°C followed by rinsing with water spray.
The nitric acid solution used for the desmutting was a waste
resulting from AC electrochemical graining.</li><li>(d) An electrochemical graining was carried out using 60Hz
alternating voltage in a continuous manner. The aqueous
electrolytic solution contained 1% by weight nitric acid, 0.5% by
weight aluminum ion and 0.007% by weight ammonium ion, and kept
at 50°C. TP, the time for the current reaching to the peak from
zero, was 2msec, and the waveform of the AC source was trapezoidal
with a duty ratio of 1:1. A carbon counter electrode and a sub-anode
made of ferrite were used. Two electrolytic vessels were used.
The peak current was 30A/dm<sup>2</sup> while the total electric quantity
was 180C/dm<sup>2</sup> when the aluminum plate acted as anode. To the
sub-anode, 5% of the source current was shared. After such graining,
the plate was rinsed with water spray.</li><li>(e) The plate was etched by spraying an aqueous solution 
containing 26% by weight sodium hydroxide and 6.5% by weight
aluminum ion at 70°C until the plate was dissolved by 1.3g/m<sup>2</sup>. By
this etching operation, the smut that had been formed during the
previous electrochemical graining and that.mainly consisted of
aluminum hydroxide was removed, and the edge portion of the pit
was made smooth by dissolving. Then, the etched plate was rinsed
by water spray.</li><li>(f) Another desmutting treatment was carried out on the plate
by spraying aqueous 25% by weight sulfuric acid solution containing
0.5% by weight aluminum ion at 60°C. Then the plate was rinsed with
water spray.</li><li>(g) Using an anodic oxidation apparatus for two-step
electrolysis in which the first and second electrolytic parts were
6m long, in which the first and second current feeding parts were
3m long, and in which the first and second current feeding
electrodes were 2.4m long, anodic oxidation was carried out on the
plate whereby the electrolytic parts were charged with aqueous
100g/l sulfuric acid that contained 0.5% by weight aluminum ion,
had a density of 1.1g/cm<sup>3</sup> as well as a conductivity of 0.39S/cm,
and kept at 50°C. After the electrolysis the plate was sprayed with
rinsing water. The final quantity of anodic oxide film was 2.4g/m<sup>2</sup>.</li><li>(h) The plate thus grained and anodized was immersed in an
aqueous 0.1% by weight sodium silicate solution for 10sec at 20°C,
then rinsed by spraying water and dried. After each treatment and
rinsing, the plate was passed between nip rollers to squeeze fluid.</li></sl></p><p num="0155">The back surface of the plate was coated with the following

intermediately annealed in a continuous annealing furnace at 500°C
for 60sec, and then cold rolled to a 30mm thick aluminum alloy web.
By controlling the surface roughness of the cold roll, the average
roughness around the center line average surface roughness Ra was
regulated to 0.2µm. The web was further machined with a tension
leveler to improve its flatness.</p><p num="0176">Next, the web surface was treated to make a desirable
substrate for lithographic printing plate.</p><p num="0177">Firstly, the rolling grease remaining on the aluminum alloy
plate surface was removed by the degreasing treatment with 10%

of the substrate surface was performed in order to achieve a firm
bonding of a photosensitive layer to the substrate and also to

and 0.5% aluminum nitrate kept at 45°C with the application of AC
of 20A/dm<sup>2</sup> current density and 1:1 duty ratio from an indirect
electricity supplying cell until the anode electric quantity

sodium aluminate at 50°C for 30sec, then neutralized with 30%
aqueous sulfuric acid at 50°C for 30sec, and subjected to smut
removing treatment.</p><p num="0179">To improve the abrasion resistance as well as the chemical
resistance and the water receptivity of the surface, an oxide film
was formed by anodization as follows. The aluminum web was passed
through an electrolytic solution comprising 20% aqueous sulfuric

kept at 70°C in such a manner that the plate be in contact with
the solution for 15sec, followed by rinsing with water. The adhered
