TECHNICAL FIELD</u></heading><p num="0001">The present invention relates to a production process for a water-absorbent resin powder.
More specifically, the present invention
relates to a production process for a water-absorbent resin powder which
is excellent in particle diameter distribution and properties, wherein the
production process not only inhibits adhesion and aggregation in the
production steps, but also is excellent in energy efficiency, drying
efficiency, and productivity.</p><p num="0002">Furthermore, the present invention relates to a process for obtaining
a water-absorbent resin powder as modified by adding an aqueous liquid
to the resultant powder, which process is to more improve properties of
the water-absorbent resin powder by bettering the uniform mixability of
the aqueous liquid even if a special mixer or organic solvent is not
especially used.</p><heading><u style="single">B. BACKGROUND ART</u></heading><p num="0003">In recent years, water-absorbent resins are widely used as
components of sanitary materials, such as disposable diapers, sanitary
napkins and incontinent pads, for the purpose of causing the water-absorbent
resins to absorb much water. In addition, the water-absorbent
resins are widely used not only for the sanitary materials, but also for the
purpose of absorbing or retaining water, like water-retaining agents for
soil and drip sheets for foods.</p><p num="0004">As to the above water-absorbent resins, the following are known as 
their examples: partially-neutralized and crosslinked poly(acrylic acids);
hydrolyzed copolymers of starch-acrylonitrile; neutralized graft polymers
of starch-acrylic acid; saponified copolymers of vinyl acetate-acrylic acid
ester; hydrolyzed copolymers of acrylonitrile or acrylamide, or crosslinked
polymers of these hydrolyzed copolymers; crosslinked polymers of
carboxymethyl cellulose; crosslinked copolymers of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic
acid (AMPS); crosslinked poly(ethylene oxide);
crosslinked polyallylamine; and crosslinked polyethylenimine. Many of
them are used as powders.</p><p num="0005">The mainstream of production processes for these water-absorbent
resins is a process comprising the steps of: polymerizing an aqueous
monomer solution (containing a crosslinking agent, if necessary); and
drying the resultant crosslinked hydrogel polymer; and further, if
necessary, pulverizing the resultant dry polymer; thus obtaining a water-absorbent
resin as a powder. However, because of high absorbency,
tackiness, and adhesion, and inferior heat resistance, the crosslinked
hydrogel polymer of the water-absorbent resin has disadvantages in that:
drying and pulverizing thereafter are very difficult, the productivity is
low, and the properties of the resultant water-absorbent resin and the
energy efficiency are very bad.</p><p num="0006">Known examples of methods for drying such a crosslinked hydrogel
polymer of the water-absorbent resin include: drying with a drum dryer
(<ref type="patent">JP-A-053165/1979</ref>); a method in which a dry powdery acrylic acid polymer
and a hydrogel are mixed together and then dried while being stirred (<ref type="patent">JP-A-117551/1982</ref>);
azeotropic dehydration (<ref type="patent">JP-A-198714/1982</ref>); drying at a
specific dew point (<ref type="patent">JP-A-026604/1989</ref>/<ref type="patent">USP 4,920,202</ref>); freeze-drying (<ref type="patent">JP-A-304127/1989</ref>,
<ref type="patent">JP-A-304128/1989</ref>); a method which involves stir-drying in a 
cylindrical dryer (<ref type="patent">JP-A-240112/1990</ref>/<ref type="patent">USP 5,005,771</ref>); a method in which a
gel is extruded through specific apertures and then dried (<ref type="patent">USP 5,275,773</ref>);
microwave drying (<ref type="patent">JP-A-209010/1993</ref>/<ref type="patent">USP 5,075,344</ref>); a method which
involves the use of a specific gel cutter followed by hot-wind drying (<ref type="patent">JP-A-230124/1993</ref>);
a method which involves hot-wind drying while
measuring the differential pressure (<ref type="patent">JP-A-073518/1996</ref>); a method which
involves stir-drying after adding a surfactant (<ref type="patent">JP-A-134134/1996</ref>); and a
method which involves static drying, and then pulverizing, and then
stirring or fluidize-drying (<ref type="patent">JP-A-240914/1999</ref>/<ref type="patent">EP 0926162</ref>).</p><p num="0007">In addition, a drying method in which the crosslinked hydrogel
polymer is dried in a state laminated on a punching metal or a metal
gauze is known. However, after being dried, the resultant dry polymer
displays bad releasability to adhere to or clog the metal gauze or the
apertures, therefore particularly the hot-wind drying etc. have problems
of much deterioration of the drying efficiency involved by deterioration
of permeability. Thus, a method is also known in which method a
special conveyer having pins is used for the purpose of inhibiting such
adhesion and clogging (<ref type="patent">JP-A-270070/1995</ref>/<ref type="patent">DE 19511769</ref>).</p><p num="0008">Furthermore, besides properties (such as water absorption capacity,
water-extractable content, and liquid permeability), the particle diameter
distribution is important for the water-absorbent resin, and the
importance of water-absorbent resins having specific narrow particle
diameter distributions is also known (<ref type="patent">JP-A-132802/1989</ref>/<ref type="patent">USP 5,061,259</ref>, <ref type="patent">JP-A-196802/1990</ref>/<ref type="patent">USP
5,244,735</ref>, <ref type="patent">JP-A-191604/1990</ref>/<ref type="patent">USP 4,973,632</ref>, <ref type="patent">JP-A-507564/1994</ref>/<ref type="patent">USP
5,419,956</ref>, and <ref type="patent">EP 0629411</ref>). In addition, a water-absorbent
resin having a plurality of particle diameter distributions is also
known (<ref type="patent">EP 0845272</ref> and <ref type="patent">JP-A-130978/1999</ref>). </p><p num="0009">Thus, efficient classification is demanded as a classification method
for such an aimed particle diameter adjustment, and the following
methods are also known as methods for classifying water-absorbent resins
after drying them: a method which involves the use of a heated or heat-retained
sieve (<ref type="patent">JP-A-202187/1998</ref>/<ref type="patent">EP 0855232</ref>); and a method which
involves the use of a classifying gauze as coated with such as Teflon (<ref type="patent">JP-A-156299/1999</ref>).
Also known is a method in which an undried product
from the drying step is classified before or during the pulverization step
(<ref type="patent">JP-A-292919/1989</ref>/<ref type="patent">EP 0948997</ref>).</p><p num="0010">However, even in these methods, because of high absorbency and
tackiness and inferior heat resistance, the water-absorbent resin and its
crosslinked hydrogel polymer have disadvantages in that: drying and
pulverizing thereafter are very difficult, and the deterioration of
properties and particle diameter distribution of the resultant water-absorbent
resin are seen, and further, the energy efficiency and the
productivity are very bad. In addition, there are problems in that
aggregation of powder in the production steps is seen also after the
pulverization or classification step, so that the production efficiency and
the quality are deteriorated.</p><p num="0011">Furthermore, there is a known method in which the particle
diameter distribution of the water-absorbent resin powder or its
absorption properties under a load are improved by adding water only or
an aqueous liquid containing an additive to the resultant polymer
powder. Such a method is often used for such as granulation (<ref type="patent">USP
5,369,148</ref>), surface-crosslinking (<ref type="patent">USP 5,409,771</ref>, <ref type="patent">USP 5,422,405</ref>, and <ref type="patent">USP
5,597,873</ref>), and decrease of residual epoxy compounds (<ref type="patent">USP 5,981,070</ref>).</p><p num="0012">However, the water-absorbent resin absorbs water in a moment and 
thereby displays tackiness. Therefore, hitherto, the improvement of
properties of the water-absorbent resin is insufficient because of
nonuniform mixing of the aqueous liquid, and further, according to
circumstance, continuous operation itself might be difficult because the
water-absorbent resin, as aggregated due to the nonuniform mixing,
adheres to the mixer. In addition, a polyhydric alcohol is favorable as the
crosslinking agent or a solvent therefor also in respect to properties and
safety, but it is difficult to uniformly mix the water-absorbent resin with
aqueous liquids, particularly, an aqueous polyhydric alcohol solution
because of its high hydrophilicity and viscosity.</p><p num="0013">Thus, there are known arts in which, when modifying a water-absorbent
resin powder by adding thereto an aqueous liquid, a special
mixer is used (<ref type="patent">EP 0450923</ref>, <ref type="patent">EP 0812873</ref>, etc.), or an inorganic powder is
used (<ref type="patent">USP 4,587,308</ref>), or an organic solvent is also used by adding it into
an aqueous liquid (<ref type="patent">USP 4,734,478</ref>). However, the use of organic solvents,
particularly, volatile ones, involves problems of causing the deterioration
of properties in addition to problems of cost, environment, and safety.
Furthermore, there is a known art in which, when adding an aqueous
liquid to a water-absorbent resin, properties (AUL/Absorbency under
Load) of the resin are controlled in a specific range (<ref type="patent">WO 98/49221</ref>).
However, in such a method, the water-absorbent resin powder to which
this method is applied is also very much limited, and its production is
also difficult.</p><heading><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><heading><u style="single">A. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0014">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above-mentioned
prior art problems and, from the above-mentioned present 
circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a
production process which can produce a water-absorbent resin powder
having a narrow particle diameter distribution and high properties by
efficiently drying or pulverizing a crosslinked hydrogel polymer and
making a particle diameter adjustment without thermal deterioration,
and which inhibits adhesion and aggregation of the water-absorbent resin
powder in the production steps, and displays good energy efficiency and
high productivity.</p><p num="0015">Furthermore, another object of the present invention is to more
improve properties of the water-absorbent resin powder by adding a
uniform aqueous liquid (particular, aqueous crosslinking agent solution)
by more improving the mixability even if a special mixer or organic
solvent is not used.</p><heading><u style="single">B. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0016">The present inventors diligently studied to achieve the above-mentioned
objects. As a result, they have completed the present
invention by finding that a production process for a water-absorbent resin
powder provides the following good results that: the energy efficiency is
good; the aggregation of the powder does not occur in the production
steps; the thermal deterioration and the adhesion are very little in the
drying step; and the pulverization step following the drying step is also
extremely efficiently done; wherein the production process comprises the
steps of: polymerizing an aqueous monomer solution containing a
crosslinking agent; heat-drying the resultant crosslinked hydrogel
polymer; and pulverizing the resultant dry polymer; wherein:

resin powder is not more than 15 weight % of the water-absorbent
resin powder.</li></sl></p><p num="0017">In addition, the present inventors have completed the present
invention by further finding that if the water-absorbent resin powder is
cooled and further if its bulk density is adjusted, then its mixability with
aqueous liquids (particularly, aqueous crosslinking agent solution) can be
improved to thereby improve the continuous operability and the
properties. </p><p num="0018">These and other objects and the advantages of the present invention
will be more fully apparent from the following detailed disclosure.</p><heading><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</b></heading><p num="0019"><sl><li>Fig. 1 is a flowchart which illustrating a representative example of
the present invention production process for a water-absorbent resin
powder. The present invention is suitable for a continuous process
including the steps of polymerization, drying, and pulverization, and one
example thereof is shown.</li></sl></p><heading><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="0020">Hereinafter, one of modes for carrying out the present invention is
explained in detail.</p><p num="0021">The production process for a water-absorbent resin powder,
according to the present invention, is a production process for a water-absorbent
resin powder which comprises the steps of: polymerizing an
aqueous monomer solution containing a crosslinking agent; heat-drying
the resultant crosslinked hydrogel polymer; and pulverizing the resultant
dry polymer; wherein:
<sl><li>the dry polymer resultant from the heat-drying step is cooled before

200 to 600 µm after the pulverization step wherein the total ratio of
particles having particle diameters of not larger than 150 µm and particles
having particle diameters of not smaller than 850 µm in the water-absorbent
resin powder is not more than 15 weight % of the water-absorbent
resin powder.</li></sl></p><p num="0022">In the first place, hereinafter, a production process for the
crosslinked hydrogel polymer in the present invention is explained.</p><p num="0023">The water-absorbent resin in the present invention means a
crosslinked polymer which can absorb 3 to 1,000 times, preferably 5 to
1,000 times, more preferably 10 to 800 times, still more preferably 100 to
700 times, as large a quantity of ion-exchanged water as its own weight
without load when being swollen to saturation, thereby forming a water-insoluble
swollen hydrogel. Incidentally, the term &quot;water-insoluble&quot; in
the present invention usually means that the water-extractable content in
the water-absorbent resin is not more than 40 weight %, preferably not 
more than 20 weight %, more preferably not more than 15 weight %,
particularly preferably not more than 10 weight %, most preferably not
more than 5 weight %, of the water-absorbent resin. Incidentally, the
methods for measuring these properties will be described in the below-mentioned
&quot;DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
EMBODIMENTS&quot; portion hereof. In the case where the water-extractable
content is much, there are disadvantages not only in that the properties
(e.g. absorption capacity under load, liquid permeation quantity under
load) are deteriorated, but also in that it is difficult to uniformly add the
aqueous liquid to the water-absorbent resin powder.</p><p num="0024">The crosslinked hydrogel polymer, as used in the present invention
production process for the water-absorbent resin powder, is a polymer
obtained by polymerizing an aqueous monomer solution containing a
crosslinking agent. Examples of this crosslinked hydrogel polymer
include crosslinked polymers which are water-absorbent and cationic,
anionic, or nonionic, and they may be used either alone respectively or in
combinations with each other. However, preferably for most displaying
the effects of the present invention, the crosslinked hydrogel polymer
comprises a major proportion of anionic crosslinked polymer as an
essential component, and more preferably, its functional groups
comprises a major proportion of carboxyl groups.</p><p num="0025">In the present invention, from the viewpoint of obtaining great
effects, the anionic crosslinked polymer is preferably a crosslinked
hydrogel polymer obtained by using acrylic acid (salt) as an acid-group-containing
unsaturated monomer (salt), and is more preferably a
crosslinked hydrogel polymer obtained by polymerizing acrylic acid (salt)
as neutralized in a ratio of 0 to 90 mol %, still more preferably 0 to 80 mol 
%, and particularly still more preferably 0 to 10 mol %. In other words,
the process according to the present invention is preferably applied to
crosslinked poly(acrylic acids), particularly, unneutralized or low-neutralized
ones, because their properties are greatly deteriorated in the
drying or pulverizing step of conventional processes.</p><p num="0026">In addition, the above monomer comprises a major proportion of
acrylic acid (salt) as stated above, and may, if necessary, further comprise
monomers other than this acrylic acid (salt), namely, other monomers
copolymerizable therewith, and further, the water-absorbent resin may be
obtained from the monomers other than acrylic acid.</p><p num="0027">The usable monomer other than acrylic acid is not especially
limited, but examples thereof include: acid-group-containing unsaturated
monomers, such as methacrylic acid, maleic acid, crotonic acid, sorbic
acid, itaconic acid, cinnamic acid, maleic anhydride, vinylsulfonic acid,
allylsulfonic acid, vinyltoluenesulfonic acid, styrenesulfonic acid, 2-(meth)acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic
acid, 2-(meth)acryloylethanesulfonic
acid, 2-(meth)acryloylpropanesulfonic acid,
and 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acryloylphosphate, and their salts; and
nonionic unsaturated monomers containing hydrophilic groups, such as
acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-ethyl(meth)acrylamide, N,N-dimethyl(meth)acrylamide,
2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl
(meth)acrylate, methoxypolyethylene glycol
(meth)acrylate, polyethylene glycol mono(meth)acrylate, vinylpyridine,
N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-acryloylpiperidine, and N-acryloylpyrrolidine.
These other monomers may be used either alone respectively or fitly in
combinations with each other. When using these other unsaturated
monomers, their content may be set at not more than 50 mol %, 
preferably not more than 30 mol %, of the monomers including acrylic
acid.</p><p num="0028">When using the acid-group-containing or basic-group-containing
monomer in the present invention, the acid or basic functional group of
the monomer or polymer may be neutralized. The neutralizing agent as
used in the present invention is not especially limited, but conventional
inorganic or organic base or acid can be used for the monomer or
polymer.</p><p num="0029">For example, when using the acid-group-containing monomer in
the present invention, specific examples of the base which is used as the
neutralizing agent for the monomer or its polymer include: inorganic
bases, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium
hydroxide, lithium carbonate, ammonium hydroxide, sodium carbonate,
potassium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate,
potassium hydrogencarbonate, and ammonium hydrogencarbonate; and
organic bases, such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine,
polyethylenimine, polyallylamine, (poly)lysine, and (poly)arginine. In
addition, when using the basic-group-containing monomer in the
present invention, inorganic or organic acids similarly may fitly be
selected as the neutralizing agents.</p><p num="0030">Incidentally, when using a high-molecular neutralizing agent (for
example, polyamine), the crosslinking may be carried out by this
neutralizing agent, but, of the above neutralizing agents, alkaline metal
salts, particularly, lithium or sodium salts, are preferably used, and 50 to
90 mol %, preferably 60 to 80 mol %, of the acid groups in the water-absorbent
resin are neutralized. The final neutralization ratio of the
water-absorbent resin as obtained in the present invention is preferably in 
the above range.</p><p num="0031">In addition, the neutralization may be carried out by using the above
base or acid in the form of aqueous solution, dispersion, or gel, or by
adding the base or acid as it is a solid, in other words, by what is called dry
blending (powder blending). In addition, the neutralization may be
carried out upon the monomer, or upon the crosslinked hydrogel
polymer before drying, or upon the dry polymer after drying, or upon a
pulverized or classified product thereof, or these neutralizations can be
used jointly with each other. Furthermore, the neutralization may be
carried out by allowing the acid and the base to entirely react with each
other, or by allowing the acid and the base to only partially react with each
other by such as dry blending, thus obtaining a water-absorbent resin
composition which is a mixture of the above acid and the above base.</p><p num="0032">In addition, when carrying out the neutralization in the present
invention, the post-neutralization of the crosslinked hydrogel polymer or
its dry polymer, particularly, the post-neutralization of the dry polymer, is
one of favorable methods in the present invention. Specifically, in the
present invention, because an unneutralized or low-neutralized
crosslinked poly(acrylic acid) can efficiently be dried (powdered) without
deteriorating its properties, it is possible to carry out the post-neutralization
of the resultant crosslinked poly(acrylic acid) powder.
Accordingly, there are advantages in that a water-absorbent resin having
higher properties can be obtained by the method in which the crosslinked
poly(acrylic acid) powder is post-neutralized.</p><p num="0033">In addition, when obtaining the above-mentioned crosslinked
hydrogel polymer, the means therefor may be such as radical crosslinking
or self crosslinking if the resultant polymer is water-insoluble. However, 
usually, a crosslinked structure is introduced into the polymer by using
an internal-crosslinking agent. This internal-crosslinking agent may be a
compound having at least two polymerizable unsaturated groups and/or
reactive groups per molecule, or a compound having at least two
substituents copolymerizable and/or reactable with the monomer per
molecule. In addition, when using the compound having at least two
reactable substituents per molecule, the crosslinking agent may
uniformly be added to a water-soluble or water-insoluble polymer gel
resultant from the polymerization, thereby post-crosslinking the inside of
the polymer gel.</p><p num="0034">Specific examples of the above internal-crosslinking agent include
N,N'-methylenebis(meth)acrylamide, (poly)ethylene glycol
di(meth)acrylate, (poly)propylene glycol di(meth)acrylate,
trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane
di(meth)acrylate, glycerol tri(meth)acrylate, glycerol acrylate methacrylate,
ethylene-oxide-modified trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate,
pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol hexa(meth)acrylate,
triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, triallyl phosphate, triallylamine,
poly(meth)allyloxyalkanes, (poly)ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, glycerol
diglycidyl ether, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol,
glycerol, pentaerythritol, ethylenediamine, polyethylenimine, and
glycidyl (meth)acrylate. However, the internal-crosslinking agent is not
especially limited.</p><p num="0035">These internal-crosslinking agents may be used either alone
respectively or in the form mixed with or separately from each other. Of
the above-exemplified internal-crosslinking agents, those which have at
least two polymerizable unsaturated groups per molecule are preferably 
used during the polymerization because they can give a water-absorbent
resin of which the properties are more improved.</p><p num="0036">The amount of the internal-crosslinking agent, as used, depends
upon the kind of the crosslinking agent or upon the aimed crosslinking
density, but is preferably in the range of 0.005 to 3 mol %, more preferably
0.01 to 1.5 mol %, still more preferably 0.05 to 1 mol %, of the above
monomer. In the case where the amount of the above internal-crosslinking
agent as used is smaller than 0.005 mol % or larger than 3
mol %, a water-absorbent resin with desired properties might not be
obtained.</p><p num="0037">Incidentally, when carrying out the polymerization, the following
materials may be added to the reaction system: hydrophilic polymers such
as starch, its derivatives, cellulose, its derivatives, poly(vinyl alcohol),
poly(acrylic acid) (or its salts), and crosslinked poly(acrylic acid) (or its
salts) (the amount of these materials as added is preferably in the range of
0 to 40 parts by weight, more preferably 0 to 10 parts by weight, per 100
parts by weight of the monomer); and chain transfer agents (e.g.
hypophosphorous acid (or its salts)), chelating agents, and foaming agents
(e.g. carbonate salts) (the amount of these materials as added is preferably
in the range of 0 to 5 parts by weight, more preferably 0 to 1 parts by
weight, per 100 parts by weight of the monomer).</p><p num="0038">The method for polymerizing the above monomer is not especially
limited. For example, conventional methods, such as aqueous solution
polymerization, reversed-phase suspension polymerization, bulk
polymerization and precipitation polymerization, are available. Of these
polymerization methods, methods in which an aqueous solution of the
monomer is prepared and then polymerized, namely, the aqueous 
solution polymerization and the reversed-phase suspension
polymerization, are preferable in the present invention in consideration
of the easiness of the polymerization reaction control and the
performance of the resultant water-absorbent resin.</p><p num="0039">Incidentally, the reversed-phase suspension polymerization is a
polymerization method which comprises the step of suspending an
aqueous monomer solution into a hydrophobic organic solvent.
Examples thereof are disclosed in US patents such as <ref type="patent">USP 4,093,776</ref>, <ref type="patent">USP

solution polymerization is a polymerization method which comprises
the step of polymerizing an aqueous monomer solution without using a
dispersing solvent. Examples thereof are disclosed in US patents such as
<ref type="patent">USP 4,625,001</ref>, <ref type="patent">USP 4,873,299</ref>, <ref type="patent">USP 4,286,082</ref>, <ref type="patent">USP 4,973,632</ref>, <ref type="patent">USP 4,985,518</ref>,

0922717</ref>. Including the above methods, the polymerization method is not
especially limited in the present invention, but the present invention is
particularly favorably utilized for the aqueous solution polymerization in
which drying and pulverization are conventionally difficult.</p><p num="0040">When adopting the aqueous solution polymerization and the
reversed-phase suspension polymerization as the polymerization
methods, the concentration of the monomer component, that is, the ratio
of the monomer in the aqueous solution, is not especially limited, but is
preferably in the range of 10 to 70 weight %, more preferably 15 to 60
weight %, still more preferably 20 to 50 weight %, particularly preferably
30 to 45 weight %, in consideration of properties.</p><p num="0041">In addition, the reaction conditions such as reaction temperature 
and reaction time may be set fitly for the monomer as used, and are not
especially limited. However, the polymerization is usually carried out in
the range of 0 °C to the boiling point, preferably 10 to 110 °C, more
preferably 15 to 100 °C (lowest temperature to highest temperature, or
initiation temperature to peak temperature), and such polymerization is
preferably carried out under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as
nitrogen. Furthermore, the atmosphere during the polymerization may
be put at a reduced or increased pressure, but usually the polymerization
is carried out under normal pressure.</p><p num="0042">Usable for initiating the polymerization are, for example, radical
polymerization initiators, such as potassium persulfate, ammonium
persulfate, sodium persulfate, t-butyl hydroperoxide, hydrogen peroxide,
and 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, or active energy rays,
such as ultraviolet rays (using an ultraviolet polymerization initiator, if
necessary) and electron beam. These may be used in combinations with
each other.</p><p num="0043">In addition, when using the above oxidizable radical polymerization
initiators, they may be combined with reducing agents, such as sodium
sulfite, sodium hydrogensulfite, ferrous sulfate, and L-ascorbic acid,
thereby carrying out redox polymerization. The amount of these
polymerization initiators as used is preferably in the range of 0.001 to 2
mol %, more preferably 0.01 to 0.5 mol %. Incidentally, the
polymerization initiator may usually be added by dissolving or dispersing
it into a solvent such as water.</p><p num="0044">The crosslinked hydrogel polymer as obtained by the above
polymerization is pulverized, if necessary, and then dried. As to this
crosslinked hydrogel polymer which gets subjected to the drying step, in 
the present invention, a particulate one (its average particle diameter is,
for example, not larger than 2 cm, preferably not larger than 1 cm, more
preferably not larger than 5 mm) is preferable also for the resulting
properties. As to the pulverization method for forming the crosslinked
hydrogel polymer into particles, in the present invention, the
pulverization may be carried out at the same time as the polymerization
by use of a kneader, or separately after the polymerization, or the
pulverization during the polymerization may be used jointly with the
pulverization after the polymerization. Incidentally, when the
crosslinked hydrogel polymer is not dried in a particulate state, for
example, when the crosslinked hydrogel polymer is dried in a filmy state,
the resultant properties or particle diameters might be inferior.</p><p num="0045">As to the particle diameter of the crosslinked hydrogel polymer
before drying, the weight-average particle diameter is preferably in the
range of 45 to 4,000 µm, more preferably 50 to 2,000 µm, still more
preferably 100 to 1,500 µm, yet still more preferably 200 to 1,000 µm, in
consideration of the drying efficiency and the properties. Examples of
apparatuses suitable for such pulverization include a kneader, a vertically
cutting type slitter having cutter blades, a horizontally cutting type slitter
having cutter blades, a cutter type pulverizer having rotary blades, and a
meat chopper having a predetermined aperture diameter. Incidentally,
in the case where the weight-average particle diameter of the crosslinked
hydrogel polymer deviates from the above range, there is a possibility
such that the water absorption capacity of the resultant water-absorbent
resin powder might be low, or that its water-extractable content might be
high.</p><p num="0046">The crosslinked hydrogel polymer as obtained in the above way 
needs to be heat-dried. Incidentally, the term &quot;drying&quot; in the present
invention means putting the crosslinked hydrogel polymer in a solid
state with a solid content of not less than 80 weight %, preferably not less
than 85 weight %, more preferably not less than 90 weight %, particularly
preferably not less than 93 weight %.</p><p num="0047">In addition, such a drying step in the present invention does not
need to give a dry polymer having a solid content of 100 weight % (water
content: 0), and the crosslinked hydrogel polymer is preferably dried to
not more than 99 weight %, more preferably not more than 98 weight %,
still more preferably not more than 97 weight %, most preferably into the
range of 97 to 93 weight %, in terms of solid content.</p><p num="0048">That is to say, when the solid content is high after the drying step, it
is easy to improve properties by surface-crosslinking, and further, the
powder aggregates little in the subsequent production steps, therefore
handling in a powdery state is easy. However, not only might much time
be needed for drying, but also the properties might be deteriorated by the
increase of fine powders in the pulverizing step or subsequent steps or
when being used, or by the drying for a long time. However, the present
invention, which involves the forcible cooling step after the drying step,
is advantageous in that: it is not necessary to, conventionally, excessively
increase the solid content of the dry polymer or water-absorbent resin
powder in order to inhibit the powder from aggregating in the production
steps and to pulverize the dry polymer, therefore the drying time can be
shortened and the properties can be improved.</p><p num="0049">The heat-drying method as used in the present invention is not
especially limited. Examples thereof include drying methods such as hot-wind
drying, thin-film drying with such as a drum dryer, reduced-pressure 
drying, stir-drying, and fluidized-bed drying. These drying
methods may be used either alone respectively or in combinations with
each other, and it doesn't especially matter whether the drying type is a
continuous type or batch type. Of the above drying methods, the hot-wind
drying, particularly, continuous hot-wind drying, is preferably used
in consideration of the properties as well as the drying efficiency in the
present invention and, for example, the continuous hot-wind drying may
be carried out by static drying on a belt.</p><p num="0050">From the viewpoint of the drying efficiency, the above hot-wind
drying may be carried out by laminating the particulate crosslinked
hydrogel polymer onto a metal gauze and/or a punching metal with
apertures or slits and then passing a hot wind through spaces between the
laminated particles in a vertical or horizontal direction, preferably in a
vertical direction, of the gel. As to the metal gauze as used or the
aperture diameter, for a example, the aperture or metal gauze may have
aeration holes of the diameter of about 0.1 to about 5 mm, preferably
about 0.2 to about 2 mm. In addition, as to the lamination of the gel onto
the metal gauze or the punching metal, the particulate crosslinked
hydrogel polymer may be laminated into a definite thickness of 1 to 20
cm, preferably 1.5 to 10 cm, more preferably 2 to 8 cm, in consideration of
the properties resultant from the drying step.</p><p num="0051">When drying the above crosslinked hydrogel polymer, the drying
temperature may be set usually at not lower than about 100 °C, preferably
in the range of about 110 to about 230 °C, more preferably about 130 to
about 200 °C, particularly preferably about 150 to about 190 °C, in
consideration of the properties and the productivity. Incidentally, the
drying temperature is determined by the material temperature or the 
temperature of the heat medium (e.g. hot wind), but, preferably, is
determined by the temperature of the heat medium. In addition, the
drying temperature may be kept constant during the drying step, or may
be changed fitly in the above temperature range on a way of the drying
step. Furthermore, when the hot-wind drying is carried out, the dew
point of the hot wind is preferably in the range of 40 to 100 °C, more
preferably 50 to 90 °C, still more preferably 60 to 85 °C, in consideration of
the properties and the energy efficiency.</p><p num="0052">The dry polymer as obtained in the above way is necessarily forcibly
cooled, and thereafter or simultaneously therewith pulverized. In the
present invention, the forcible cooling and the pulverization may be
carried out simultaneously with each other, but, preferably, the
pulverization is carried out after the forcible cooling. In the present
invention, the term &quot;forcible cooling&quot; represents a procedure or step for
cooling the dry polymer externally and intentionally. In addition, the
term &quot;pulverization&quot; represents a mechanical procedure for forming the
resultant dry polymer or its aggregate (block-shaped material) into a fluid
powder. Furthermore, the term &quot;disintegration&quot; represents a mechanical
procedure which does not lead to physical destruction of the dry polymer
or its particle diameter reduction, but lightly disintegrates the aggregation
into several millimeters to tens of millimeters, and.</p><p num="0053">Incidentally, it is also herein mentioned that the particulate
crosslinked hydrogel polymer as dried in the laminated state easily
becomes a block-shaped dry material by losing the fluidity due to
aggregation between particles after being dried. Such a block-shaped
material is an aggregate of particles of the dry polymer and therefore has
continuous spaces and gas permeability through the blocks, but has 
nonfluidity due to aggregation and therefore needs the pulverization
(disintegration) step.</p><p num="0054">As to the method for carrying out the forcible cooling in the present
invention, the dry polymer may be cooled to a predetermined
temperature by intentionally inserting the cooling step between the
drying step and the pulverizing step. Examples of the forcible cooling
method include: (1) a method in which the dry polymer is placed into a
vessel (hopper) or cylinder having a cooled heat transfer surface and, if
necessary, involving agitation, and then forcibly cooled; (2) a method in
which the dry polymer is sufficiently cooled by heat radiation therefrom
on a continuous belt (which has been used in the drying step); (3) a
method in which the dry polymer is forcibly cooled by passing a cold
wind through it; (4) a method in which the dry polymer is forcibly cooled
simultaneously with transportation using a cold air; and (5) a method in
which the dry polymer is forcibly cooled using a low-temperature screw
conveyer having a cooled heat transfer surface; wherein the dry polymer
is a product by the heat-drying.</p><p num="0055">Of these methods, the method (3) involving the cold wind through-passing
is preferably used in view of the cooling efficiency and the fluidity
of the dry polymer in the present invention. In this method, the cold
wind may be passed only through the surface of the dry polymer, but is
preferably passed through spaces between the laminated particles in a
vertical or horizontal direction, preferably in a vertical direction, of the
laminated dry polymer or its block-shaped material because thereby the
forcible cooling can more efficiently be carried out. Incidentally, in the
case where the lamination is performed, its thickness is preferably in the
aforementioned range. </p><p num="0056">The forcible cooling in the present invention is necessarily carried
out before or during the pulverization. In addition, the present
inventors have found that the object of the present invention is not
achieved unless the forcible cooling is carried out before or during the
pulverization rather in the case of drying on a production scale, unlike
the case of drying and pulverization on a laboratory scale which are
polymerization, drying, and pulverization on a small scale in a
laboratory, and further, involve easy natural heat radiation cooling
because the experimental procedures are discontinuous therebetween and
because the interval therebetween is in the range of tens of minutes to
several hours or more. That is to say, the present invention is more
favorable for continuous drying, continuous pulverization, and the
subsequent continuous addition of the aqueous liquid on a large scale in
production facilities (for example, treating not less than 1 ton/day,
preferably not less than 10 tons/day, of water-absorbent resin powder per
line).</p><p num="0057">In the case where the forcible cooling (which is an essential feature
of the present invention) is not carried out after the heat-drying, the
efficiency of the pulverization or classification is greatly deteriorated,
therefore the water-absorbent resin powder which has excellent particle
diameter distribution cannot be obtained with good productivity.
Furthermore, in the case where the hot-wind drying is carried out on the
metal gauze or the punching metal, conventionally the resultant dry
polymer adheres to or clogs the metal gauze or the punching metal and
therefore greatly deteriorates the gas permeability, the drying efficiency
and the productivity. However, the present invention which involves
the forcible cooling does not have such problems and does not need 
either a special apparatus for inhibiting the adhesion (<ref type="patent">JP-A-270070/1995</ref>)
or the periodic removal of the adhesion or clogging from the dryer. In
addition, the forcible cooling before or during the pulverization has
advantages in that the particle diameter distribution and the
pulverization rate of the resultant water-absorbent resin powder are also
excellent, and in that the adhesion to the pulverizer and the aggregation
of the powder in the production steps are also greatly decreased, and
further in that it is not necessary to excessively dry the water-absorbent
resin powder in order to inhibit the powder from aggregating in the
subsequent production steps, therefore the drying time can be shortened
and the properties can be improved.</p><p num="0058">The cold wind (gas) as used for the aforementioned method (3) in
the present invention is fitly determined according to the temperature of
the aimed dry polymer. The forcible cooling is carried out by a gas having
a temperature of not higher than 60 °C, preferably in the range of 50 to
-50 °C, more preferably 40 to -10 °C, particularly preferably 35 to 5 °C, in
consideration of the cooling efficiency. On this occasion, the dew point of
the gas is preferably not higher than 60 °C, more preferably not higher
than 50 °C. In addition, such a gas may be an inert gas, such as nitrogen,
or a mixed gas comprising the inert gas and air, but air, particularly,
filtered air, is preferably used.</p><p num="0059">Furthermore, the wind speed of the cold wind is in the range of
about 10 to about 0.1 m/s, preferably about 5 to about 0.5 m/s. The cooling
time is preferably in the range of 60 to 0.1 minutes, more preferably 20 to
0.2 minutes, still more preferably 10 to 0.5 minutes.</p><p num="0060">As to the forcible cooling temperature in the present invention, the
dry polymer is forcibly cooled to a temperature of not higher than 95 °C, 
preferably into the range of 85 to 35 °C, more preferably 80 to 40 °C, still
more preferably 70 to 45 °C. Incidentally, the forcible cooling temperature
is determined by fitly measuring the material temperature with such as a
contacting thermometer or noncontacting thermometer (infrared
thermometer), and further, if necessary, controlled.</p><p num="0061">In the case where the temperature of the dry polymer is higher than
95 °C, it is so difficult to release the polymer from the metal gauze or
punching metal of the dryer that the drying efficiency is low, and further,
the efficiency of the pulverization or classification of the dry polymer is
greatly deteriorated and, as a result, it is difficult to obtain an excellent
water-absorbent resin powder having a narrow particle diameter
distribution. In addition, in the case where the temperature is too low,
there are disadvantages not only in that a long time or large facilities are
needed for cooling, but also in that an aggregate of the water-absorbent
resin powder unexpectedly forms during the pulverization or
classification. Furthermore, the overcooling might be disadvantageous to
the below-mentioned forcible heating and surface-crosslinking in respect
to properties and energy.</p><p num="0062">In addition, as to the temperature lowering of the dry polymer by the
forcible cooling in order to achieve the present invention, although it
depends upon the heat-drying temperature, the dry polymer may be
forcibly cooled to the above-mentioned aimed temperature (for example,
more preferably in the range of 80 to 40 °C) by forcibly cooling the dry
polymer so that the temperature of the dry polymer can change by
preferably not less than 40 °C, more preferably not less than 60 °C, still
more preferably not less than 80 °C, particularly preferably not less than
100 °C, from before till after the forcible cooling. </p><p num="0063">Incidentally, the heat as taken away from the dry polymer by the
forcible cooling is preferably recycled. For example, as is aforementioned,
in the present invention, the heat-drying is carried out by hot-wind
drying (particularly preferably in the range of 150 to 180 °C), and the
forcible cooling is carried out by wind-cooling (particularly preferably, the
polymer is forcibly cooled into the range of 70 to 45 °C). When carrying
out such drying by hot-wind and forcible cooling by wind-cooling in the
present invention, the cold wind as used for the forcible cooling of the
dry polymer is controlled fitly for factors, such as the wind speed or
through-flow rate of the cold wind or the temperature of the polymer, but
becomes a warm or hot wind (usually of not lower than 50 °C, preferably
in the range of 50 to 200 °C, more preferably in the range of 60 to 150 °C,
still more preferably in the range of 70 to 110 °C) due to the forcible
cooling. Therefore, the resultant warm or hot wind may be recycled and
then, as it is, utilized for the production steps for the water-absorbent
resin, or may be reheated and then utilized for the production steps for
the water-absorbent resin, such as the aforementioned hot-wind drying.</p><p num="0064">In the present invention the heat obtained by the forcible cooling is
preferably recycled. Examples of the production steps in which the
recycled heat is used include the heat-retaining step, but the below-mentioned
drying step is the most preferable. Specifically, the cold wind
used for the forcible cooling becomes a warm wind by being passed
through the dry polymer, therefore preferably in the present invention
this warm wind (e.g. 60 to 150 °C) resultant from the forcible cooling is
supplied through piping into an air-supplying inlet of a hot-wind dryer to
thereby be used as a raw material for drying, so that the continuous
drying can be carried out. In the hot-wind drying step in the present 
invention, in this way, the warm wind resultant from the forcible cooling
is used in place of air of room temperature in order to produce a hot
wind, therefore there are advantages in that much energy saving is
realizable rewarding it and in that the warm wind (waste gas) is not
discharged to the environment. Also in view of such recycling, forcible
cooling by passing a cold wind through the polymer is used for the
forcible cooling step in the present invention, and further, hot-wind
drying is used for the heat-drying step in the present invention.</p><p num="0065">That is to say, the present invention further provides a production
process for a water-absorbent resin powder which comprises the steps of:
polymerizing an aqueous monomer solution containing a crosslinking
agent; heat-drying the resultant crosslinked hydrogel polymer; and
pulverizing the resultant dry polymer; with the production process
further comprising the steps of: forcibly cooling the dry polymer after the
heat-drying step; and recycling the resultant heat in order to utilize it for
forcible heating in a production process for a water-absorbent resin
(which involves heating of the gel such as drying step). In this
production process, the recycling for the forcible heating means that the
heat as obtained in the forcible cooling step is utilized for the forcible
heating step. The forcible cooling step and the forcible heating step may
both be included in the same production line, or may separately be
included in their respective production lines.</p><p num="0066">In addition, when carrying out the hot-wind drying and the wind-cooling
in the present invention, such as a fluid bed is separately set as a
drying and cooling apparatus. For example, when carrying out
continuous hot-wind drying, also preferable is a method in which: a belt
type dryer is used and a portion of the second half of the dryer is utilized 
for the cooling step. In this method, even if the cooling apparatus is not
separately set, a 1/4 to 1/20 portion (preferably 1/8 to 1/16 portion) of the
second half of the belt of the hot-wind dryer may be partitioned off as a
cooling apparatus to feed a cold wind to this portion to thereby carrying
out the forcible cooling step, and then the heat as taken away from the dry
polymer may be recycled.</p><p num="0067">The present invention can afford excellent energy efficiency to the
process because the heat as obtained by forcibly cooling the dry polymer is
recycled. In addition, there are advantages in that: the releasability of the
dry polymer from the metal gauze or punching metal of the belt is greatly
enhanced by forcibly cooling the second half of the dryer, and the drying
efficiency is also enhanced because of the enhancement of the gas
permeability due to no clogging of the belt.</p><p num="0068">The dry polymer, as forcibly cooled to a predetermined temperature
in the above way, is then pulverized or classified, preferably, necessarily
pulverized and then classified. The drying step and the pulverization or
classification step, as mentioned above, are preferably carried out
continuously to each other, and the residence time from an outlet of the
dryer to an inlet of the pulverizer is within 10 minutes, preferably within
5 minutes, more preferably within 2 minutes. In the present invention,
even if the above steps are carried out continuously to each other in this
way, the drying and pulverizing efficiencies can greatly be enhanced by
inserting the forcible cooling step between the drying step and the
pulverizing step.</p><p num="0069">There is no especial limitation with regard to the pulverization
method in the present invention if the dry polymer or its aggregate
(block-shaped material) can be formed into a fluid powder, preferably a 
powder having an average particle diameter of not larger than 2 mm.
Examples thereof include: a pulverization method involving the use of a
hammer type pulverizer, a roll type pulverizer, or a jet air stream type
pulverizer; and conventional various pulverization or disintegration
methods. These methods may be used either alone respectively or in
combinations with each other. In addition, in the case where the
aggregation is weak in the drying step, the pulverizing step may be carried
out by classifying the dry polymer while vibrating it, thereby loosening
the aggregation of the polymer, even if no pulverizer is especially used.</p><p num="0070">In the present invention, coarse particles and fine powders are if
necessary or preferably removed by classification after the above
pulverization. The average particle diameter of the water-absorbent resin
powder as obtained in this way is determined according to purposes, but,
for example, in the case where this powder is used for sanitary materials,
the average particle diameter of the water-absorbent resin powder as
finally obtained is in the range of 200 to 600 µm, preferably 300 to 600 µm,
more preferably 300 to 550 µm, and the total ratio of particles having
particle diameters of not larger than 150 µm and particles having particle
diameters of not smaller than 850 µm in the water-absorbent resin
powder is preferably not more than 15 weight %, more preferably not
more than 10 weight %, still more preferably not more than 5 weight %,
of the water-absorbent resin powder.</p><p num="0071">In the present invention, particularly, it is preferable that the water-absorbent
resin powder, as obtained after the pulverization step and then
used for the next step, has an average particle diameter in the above
range, namely, in the range of 200 to 600 µm wherein the total ratio of
particles having particle diameters of not larger than 150 µm and particles 
having particle diameters of not smaller than 850 µm in the water-absorbent
resin powder is not more than 15 weight % of the water-absorbent
resin powder.</p><p num="0072">The bulk density of the water-absorbent resin powder as obtained in
the above way variously changes according to true density (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) which
is absolutely determined by the monomer composition one by one.
However, for example, when the water-absorbent resin is a poly(sodium
acrylate), particularly, that which has a neutralization ratio of 50 to 90 mol
%, preferably 60 to 80 mol %, the bulk density is usually not less than 0.63
g/ml, particularly preferably not less than 0.65 g/ml, as measured by the
apparatus according to JIS K-3362. In the forcible cooling method in the
present invention, the water-absorbent resin powder resultant from the
pulverization has few scales and has a more roundish and uniform
shape. Therefore, the bulk density of the powder tends to be high, and is
preferably adjusted into the range of 0.65 to 0.89 g/ml, more preferably
0.67 to 0.88 g/ml, still more preferably 0.73 to 0.87 g/ml, yet still more
preferably 0.74 to 0.86 g/ml, yet still more preferably 0.75 to 0.85 g/ml.</p><p num="0073">In the case where the bulk density is lower than 0.63 g/ml, there are
disadvantages in that: it becomes difficult to mix the below-mentioned
aqueous liquid even if the temperature is controlled; and not only
deterioration of properties (absorption capacity under a load, liquid
permeability under a load), but also, for example, deterioration of impact
resistance (process damage) of the water-absorbent resin powder, and
increase of the transportation cost due to decrease of the weight per unit
volume might be observed. In addition, in the case where the bulk
density is higher than 0.89 g/ml, it can be difficult to ensure liquid
permeation spaces in a gel when being swollen by liquid permeation 
under a load.</p><p num="0074">After the above pulverization, coarse particles (e.g. 850-µm-on
fractions) or fine powders (e.g. 150-µm-passed fractions) may be recycled
fitly as the case may be. The coarse particles may be repulverized, and the
fine particles may be removed or recovered, thus adjusting the particle
diameter distribution into the aforementioned range. However, in the
present invention the necessity of such recycling is greatly decreased
because the particle diameter distribution is narrow. Incidentally,
methods for recycling the fine powders of water-absorbent resins are, for
example, disclosed in <ref type="patent">USP 4,950,692</ref>, <ref type="patent">USP 5,064,582</ref>, <ref type="patent">USP 5,264,495</ref>, <ref type="patent">USP
5,478,879</ref>, <ref type="patent">EP 0812873</ref>, <ref type="patent">EP 0885917</ref>, and <ref type="patent">EP 0844270</ref>, and these fine powder
recycling methods can also be applied to the present invention.</p><p num="0075">In addition, the amount of fine powders being recycled is not larger
than 15 weight %, preferably in the range of 1 to 10 weight %, more
preferably 2 to 8 weight %, of the entirety. In the present invention, a
water-absorbent resin powder having a narrow particle diameter
distribution can be obtained with good productivity, therefore there are
advantages in that a water-absorbent resin powder having a narrower
particle diameter distribution can be obtained by the recycling of a small
amount of fine powder.</p><p num="0076">In the present invention in which the cooling is carried out before
the pulverization, the resultant particle diameter distribution is narrower
than conventional ones, and further, there are the following effects: the
pulverization time to obtain such a particle diameter distribution is
shortened; coarse water-absorbent resin powders having particle
diameters larger than the aimed ones are decreased; it is unnecessary to
take the trouble to separate the largest particles or fine powders which 
deviate from the purpose; and the labor for recycling such as
repulverization of large particles (e.g. 850-µm-on fractions) and
reclassification of fines (e.g. 150-µm-passed fractions) decreases.</p><p num="0077">It is preferable that after being cooled and then pulverized and then
classified, the water-absorbent resin powder is, further, heat-retained or
forcibly heated in the next step. The temperature of the heat-retention
from the outside is in the range of 40 to 100 °C, preferably 50 to 90 °C. The
heat-retention of the water-absorbent resin powder at such a temperature
improves the handling ability of the water-absorbent resin powder and
inhibits the aggregation and adhesion of the water-absorbent resin
powder in the production steps. In the present invention, the drying and
pulverizing efficiencies may be enhanced by daring to forcibly cool and
then pulverize or classify the dry polymer and, separately, the water-absorbent
resin powder may further be heat-retained or forcibly heated
(reheated) after being cooled.</p><p num="0078">Incidentally, in the case where the aqueous liquid, especially, an
aqueous crosslinking agent solution, is added, it is preferable that the
water-absorbent resin powder, as obtained by carrying out the forcible
cooling before the pulverization, is further forcibly cooled after the
pulverization, thereby adjusting the temperature of the powder. The
means for this temperature controlling or cooling is not especially
limited, but the pulverization increases the fluidity and the specific
surface area of the water-absorbent resin powder, therefore it is possible to
more preferably apply the aforementioned cooling means, for example:
(1) a method in which the powder is placed into a vessel (hopper) or
cylinder having a cooled heat transfer surface and, if necessary, involving
agitation, and then forcibly cooled; (2) a method in which the powder is 
sufficiently cooled by heat radiation therefrom on a continuous belt; (3) a
method in which the powder is forcibly cooled by passing a cold wind
through it; (4) a method in which the powder is forcibly cooled
simultaneously with transportation using a cold air; and (5) a method in
which the powder is forcibly cooled using a low-temperature screw
conveyer having a cooled heat transfer surface. It is, however, preferable
to use at least the method (1).</p><p num="0079">Specifically, the temperature of the water-absorbent resin powder, to
which the aqueous liquid has not been added yet, is preferably lowered
(controlled) into the range of 80 to 35 °C, more preferably 70 to 35 °C, still
more preferably 60 to 35 °C, particularly preferably 50 to 35 °C, by the
aforementioned forcible cooling and, if necessary, further heat-retaining
or cooling, and then the aqueous liquid is added to this powder. In the
case where the temperature of the water-absorbent resin powder, to
which the aqueous liquid has not been added yet, is high, the mixing of
the aqueous liquid is nonuniform. In addition, in the case where the
powder is cooled forcibly or by heat radiation as much as to lower than 35
°C, there are disadvantages in that: not only does it take much time, but
also the aggregation of the cooled powder is observed, or the energy loss is
much in the reheating step.</p><p num="0080">The water-absorbent resin powder as obtained in the above way has
excellent particle diameter distribution and is therefore favorable for
more improving its properties by surface-crosslinking. The following
forcible heating may separately be carried out for the surface-crosslinking.</p><p num="0081">Specifically, considering the step of forcibly heating the water-absorbent
resin powder after the pulverization or classification step, the
forcible cooling step in the present invention appears to be in vain with 
respect to energy and process, but, unexpectedly, comparatively increases
the drying and pulverizing efficiencies, and also enhances the mixability
of the resultant water-absorbent resin powder with the aqueous liquid.</p><p num="0082">There is no especial limitation in the surface-crosslinking agent as
used in the present invention, if this agent comprises a compound
reactable with a functional group of the above polymer. Specific
examples of the above surface-crosslinking agent include: polyhydric
alcohols such as propylene glycol, glycerol, and butanediol; polyepoxy
compounds such as ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether; polyamine
compounds such as (poly)ethylenimine; alkylene carbonate compounds;
polyoxazoline compounds; haloepoxy compounds and their polyamine
adducts (e.g. polyamide-polyamide epihalohydrin adducts: Kymene
(trademark) made by Hercules); mono-, di-, or polyoxazolidinone
compounds; and polyvalent metals, but there is no especial limitation
thereto. These surface-crosslinking agents may be used either alone
respectively or in combinations with each other. In the case where the
combinations are used in the present invention, the use of a surface-crosslinking
agent comprising a combination of a first surface-crosslinking
agent and a second surface-crosslinking agent whose
solubility parameters (SP values) are deferent from each other (refer to
<ref type="patent">USP 5,422,405</ref>), of the above surface-crosslinking agents, has the
advantage of enabling to obtain a water-absorbent resin powder which
exhibits particularly excellent absorption capacity under a heavy load (e.g.
not less than 4.90 kPa).</p><p num="0083">The amount of the above crosslinking agent, as used, is determined
fitly for such as its type and reaction conditions, but is usually in the
range of 0.001 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.01 to 5 parts by weight, 
more preferably 0.5 to 4 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the
solid content of the water-absorbent resin powder.</p><p num="0084">When the step of mixing the above polymer and surface-crosslinking
agent together is carried out, such as water, steam, or an
aqueous liquid comprising water and a hydrophilic organic solvent may
be added during or after this mixing step, if necessary. The amount of
water, as used in this case, depends upon such as the kind or particle
diameter of the polymer as used, but is not larger than 10 parts by weight,
preferably in the range of 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, more preferably 1 to 5
parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the solid content of the water-absorbent
resin powder.</p><p num="0085">The hydrophilic organic solvent is not especially limited, but specific
examples thereof include: lower alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl
alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, iso-propyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, iso-butyl
alcohol, and t-butyl alcohol; ketones such as acetone; ethers such as
dioxane and tetrahydrofuran; amides such N,N-dimethylformamide; and
sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide.</p><p num="0086">When mixing the above polymer and surface-crosslinking agent
together, for example, the polymer may be dispersed into the above
aqueous liquid to then mix the resultant dispersion with the surface-crosslinking
agent, or the surface-crosslinking agent may be dissolved
into water or the aqueous liquid to then spraying or dropwise adding the
resultant solution directly to the polymer, thereby mixing them together.
In addition, in the case where the mixing step is carried out using water,
there may coexist such as water-insoluble finely-particulate powders,
various organic or inorganic acids, or surfactants. Of these mixing
methods, the spray-mixing method is preferable, and in this method the 
aqueous liquid is added in the form of fine drops of preferably not larger
than 500 µm, more preferably not larger than 300 µm.</p><p num="0087">In addition, in the case where the aqueous liquid is added in the
present invention, the internal wall of the mixer preferably has a
temperature higher than room temperature. It is preferable that the
internal wall temperature of the mixer is maintained at not lower than 40
°C, more preferably in the range of 45 to 100 °C, still more preferably 50 to
95 °C, yet still more preferably 55 to 90 °C, and that the internal wall
temperature is higher than the temperature of the water-absorbent resin
powder to which the aqueous liquid has not been added yet, more
preferably by within 40 °C, still more preferably by within 20 °C,
particularly preferably by within 10 °C. Incidentally, the term &quot;internal
wall&quot; represents internal surfaces, including agitation blades, of the
mixer. In the case of the continuous mixing, it is preferable that these
temperatures are controlled to temperature in a stationary state,
particularly, metal portions are necessarily controlled.</p><p num="0088">In the case where the internal wall temperature of the mixer is not
higher than room temperature, even if the temperature of the powder is
controlled there is a possibility that the water-absorbent resin powder to
which the aqueous liquid has been added might adhere to the internal
wall, or that the properties of the resultant water-absorbent resin powder
might be deteriorated. In addition, in the case where the internal wall
temperature is too high, there is a possibility that such as the crosslinking
agent in the aqueous solution might lose its effects, or that the aqueous
liquid might nonuniformly be mixed.</p><p num="0089">There is no especial limitation in the control of the internal wall
temperature of the mixer if the control to the above-mentioned 
temperature is possible. The temperature may be controlled, for example,
by a method (1) which involves external heating with a warm wind or
heating medium, or the mixer itself may be structured so as to sufficiently
heat-retain itself and then the internal wall temperature of the mixer
may be controlled by a method (2) which involves continuously mixing a
large amount (for example, not smaller than 500 kg/hr) of powder or
aqueous liquid having a specific temperature, or by a method (3) which
involves utilizing either hydration heat of the water-absorbent resin
powder as generated by adding thereto the aqueous liquid or frictional
heat as generated when mixing. These controlling methods may be used
in combinations with each other, but the method (1) is preferably used.</p><p num="0090">Furthermore, as to these methods, it is preferable that the mixer
having a specific internal wall temperature is a high-speed-stirring-type
mixer with stirring blades. The mixer usually operates to perform stir-mixing
at a revolution rate of not slower than 10 rpm, preferably in the
range of 100 to 10,000 rpm, more preferably 300 to 5,000 rpm, most
preferably 500 to 3,000 rpm. The stirring time is usually within 5 minutes,
preferably within 3 minutes, more preferably within 1 minute, still more
preferably within 0.2 minute. In addition, it is more preferable to use a
gas-current-stirring-type mixer having a plurality of stirring blades as a
mixer.</p><p num="0091">In the process according to the present invention, the improvement
of properties due to the mixability improvement is great, therefore it is
preferable that the aqueous liquid is an aqueous crosslinking agent
solution and, for greatly displaying the effects of the present invention, it
is particularly preferable that the aqueous crosslinking agent solution,
which is conventionally difficult to mix with the water-absorbent resin, is 
an aqueous polyhydric alcohol solution (which further contains a
crosslinking agent other than the polyhydric alcohol, if necessary),
especially, an aqueous solution containing only the polyhydric alcohol as
the crosslinking agent, and/or that the aqueous liquid contains no
organic solvents other than the polyhydric alcohol, especially, no volatile
organic solvents. In addition, in the case where the internal wall
temperature of the mixer is raised, the addition of the aqueous liquid in
the present invention can favorably be applied to crosslinking agents
which are inactive even at the internal wall temperature, such as
crosslinking agents having a reaction temperature of not lower than 110
°C which is necessary for reheating, particularly, polyhydric alcohols.</p><p num="0092">In addition, in the present invention, the polyhydric alcohol may be
used as a crosslinking agent, or as a solvent for a crosslinking agent by
being used at not higher than the reaction temperature of the polyhydric
alcohol, or these functions may be combined. Incidentally, the
crosslinking agent other than the polyhydric alcohol, as used, is
exemplified by the aforementioned crosslinking agents and by the below-mentioned
prior art documents. Examples of polyhydric alcohols which
most greatly give the effects of the present invention in respect to
properties include those which have 3 to 8 carbon atoms, particularly,
glycerol, propylene glycol, butanediol, pentanediol, hexanediol
(incidentally, the diol substituent position is not limited).</p><p num="0093">Incidentally, the volatile organic solvent, as referred to in the
present invention, means solvents having a boiling point of not higher
than the temperature at which the below-mentioned crosslinking
reaction is carried out, particularly, organic solvents having a boiling
point of not higher than 100 °C, preferably not higher than 85 °C. In the 
present invention, the addition of an aqueous liquid which involves no
use of these organic solvents has the advantage of giving a water-absorbent
resin which is also excellent in respect to environment, cost
and safety.</p><p num="0094">In the present invention, after the above polymer and surface-crosslinking
agent are mixed together, the surface vicinity of the polymer
is crosslinked wherein this crosslinking is carried out by forcible heating
if necessary according to the kind of the surface-crosslinking agent. The
forcible heating temperature depends upon the kind of the surface-crosslinking
agent, but is preferably not lower than 100 °C, more
preferably in the range of 110 to 230 °C, still more preferably 160 to 220 °C.
The forcible heating time is fitly determined, but is preferably in the range
of 1 to 120 minutes, more preferably 5 to 60 minutes. In addition,
examples of the apparatus used for the forcible heating include: channel
type blending dryers, rotary dryers, disk dryers, fluidized-bed dryers, air
blow type dryers, and infrared dryers. Incidentally, these heating
apparatuses are set separately from the aforementioned mixing
apparatuses and preferably connected thereto.</p><p num="0095">Incidentally, the above surface-crosslinking methods are also

the following examples of some preferred embodiments in comparison
with comparative examples not according to the invention. However,
the invention is not limited to these examples. Incidentally, the
performances of the water-absorbent resin powder were measured by the
methods shown below. In addition, such as polymerization, drying, and
pulverization in the examples were carried out by a series of continuous
procedures which simulated actual production.</p><heading>(a) Water absorption capacity without load:</heading><p num="0109">First, 0.200 g of water-absorbent resin powder was uniformly placed
into a nonwoven-fabric-made bag (60 mm x 60 mm), and then the bag
was heat-sealed and then immersed into a great excess (about 200 g) of 0.9
weight % physiological saline solution at room temperature. Sixty
minutes later than this immersion, the bag was drawn up and then
drained at 250 G for 3 minutes with a centrifuge, and the resultant weight
W1 (g) of the bag was then measured. On the other hand, the same
procedure was carried out without the water-absorbent resin powder, and
the resultant weight W0 (g) was measured. Thus, the water absorption
capacity (g/g) without load was calculated from these weights W1 and W0
in accordance with the following equation (a): <st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">water absorption capacity (g/g) without load<st32:break type="required" />
= (weight W1 (g) - weight W0 (g) - 0.2)/0.2 (g).</st32:df></p><heading>(b) Water-extractable content:</heading><p num="0110">First, 1.000 g of water-absorbent resin powder was swollen and
dispersed in 184.3 g of physiological saline solution, and then stirred in a
beaker (capacity: 200 ml) for 16 hours. Thereafter, the resultant swollen
gel was separated by filtration with a paper filter. Next, carboxyl groups in
the resultant filtrate were subjected to neutralization titration with a 0.1
N (0.1 mol/l) aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and a 0.1 N (0.1 mol/l)
aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, thereby calculating the amount of
water-soluble polymer (= water-soluble poly(acrylic acid) (salt)) in the
filtrate which water-soluble polymer had been extracted from the water-absorbent
resin powder (swollen gel), namely, the water-extractable
content (weight %) of the water-absorbent resin powder.</p><heading>(c) Solid content of water-absorbent resin:</heading><p num="0111">First, 1.000 g of water-absorbent resin powder, as obtained from the
dry polymer, was placed into an aluminum-made cup (inner diameter 53
mm × height 23 mm) and then redried in a wind-free oven of 180 °C for 3
hours to calculate the solid content (weight %) of the water-absorbent
resin powder (or dry polymer) from its weight loss (g) on drying.
Incidentally, the solid content of the dry polymer was that of the
pulverized one as measured in the same way as the above after the
pulverization of the dry polymer.</p><heading>(d) Particle diameter distribution and average particle diameter:</heading><p num="0112">The water-absorbent resin powder was classified with JIS standard
sieves (850 µm, 600 µm, 300 µm, and 150 µm), and then the weight of
fractions having particle diameters corresponding to each sieve (850-µm-on 
fractions/fractions ranging from 850 to 600 µm/fractions ranging from
600 to 300 µm/fractions ranging from 300 to 150 µm/150-µm-passed
fractions) was measured. In addition, another JIS standard sieve was
added, if necessary, and then the measured particle diameter distribution
was plotted on logarithmic probability paper to determine the weight-average
particle diameter (D50).</p><heading>(e) Absorption capacity under load:</heading><p num="0113">In accordance with the methods as disclosed in the working
examples portions of <ref type="patent">EP 0885917</ref>, <ref type="patent">EP 0817873</ref>, and <ref type="patent">EP 0811636</ref>, the
absorption capacity of the water-absorbent resin powder for physiological
saline solution under a load of 50 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (corresponding to about 4.90 kPa)
was measured.</p><p num="0114">Namely, while a load of 50 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (about 4.90 kPa) was uniformly
applied to 0.900 g of water-absorbent resin powder, the weight W2 (g) of
the physiological saline solution as absorbed at room temperature by the
water-absorbent resin powder over a period of 60 minutes was measured
with a balance. Then, the water absorption capacity (g/g) under the load
in 60 minutes from the absorption initiation was calculated from the
above weight W2 in accordance with the following equation (b) to
determine the absorption capacity (g/g) under the load of 50 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (about

water absorption capacity without load was 55 g/g, and the water-extractable
content was 6 weight %.</p><p num="0155">In addition, the cold wind, as used for the forcible cooling of the
block-shaped material of the particulate dry polymer (5), was heated to
about 90 °C due to this use for the forcible cooling, therefore the resultant
warm wind was supplied to an air-supplying inlet of the belt type hot-wind
dryer of Production Example 5 through piping to recycle the warm
wind as a raw material of a hot wind (180 °C) for drying, thereby carrying
out the continuous drying of Production Example 5. In this way, in the
hot-wind drying of Production Example 5, the hot wind of 180 °C is
produced by using the warm wind of about 90 °C instead of air of room
temperature, therefore there are advantages in that energy is greatly 
saved at that rate, and in that the warm gas (exhaust gas) is not discharged
into the environment.</p><heading>(Example 19): adding aqueous liquid and post-heating/powder
temperature = 50 °C</heading><p num="0156">The water-absorbent resin powder (18), as obtained by undergoing
the forcible cooling, was supplied at a powder temperature of 50 °C to a
high-speed continuous mixer (turbilizer/1,000 rpm) at a rate of 100 kg/h.
Furthermore, an aqueous surface-crosslinking agent solution with a
composition of 1,4-butanediol/propylene glycol/water/isopropanol =
0.32/0.50/2.73/0.5 (weight % based on the powder) was sprayed to the
water-absorbent resin powder (18) under conditions of spray diameter =
about 250 µm. Next, the resultant mixture was continuously reheat-treated
at 195 °C for 40 minutes, thus obtaining a surface-crosslinked
water-absorbent resin powder (19). The results are shown in Table 2.
Incidentally, the internal wall temperature of the high-speed continuous
mixer (turbilizer) during the continuous mixing was in the range of
about 70 to about 80 °C due to the powder temperature and the frictional
heat, and the powder was therefore heated, with the result that there
occurred little adhesion.</p><heading>(Example 20): adding aqueous liquid and post-heating/powder
temperature = 50 °C</heading><p num="0157">A surface-crosslinked water-absorbent resin powder (20) was
obtained in the same way as of Example 19 except that: the aqueous
surface-crosslinking agent solution was changed to an aqueous surface-crosslinking
agent solution with a composition of ethylene glycol
diglycidyl ether/propylene glycol/water/isopropanol = 0.03/1/3/0.9
(weight % based on the powder) to spray this solution to the water-absorbent 
resin powder (18), and then the resultant mixture was
continuously reheat-treated at 190 °C for 35 minutes. The results are
shown in Table 2.</p><heading>(Example 21): adding aqueous liquid and post-heating/powder
temperature = 30 °C</heading><p num="0158">The water-absorbent resin powder (18), as obtained in Example 18,
was further cooled to a powder temperature of 30 °C and then mixed with
the aqueous surface-crosslinking agent solution in the same way as of
Example 19, and then the resultant mixture was continuously reheat-treated
at 195 °C for 40 minutes. Because of the cooling to the powder
temperature of 30 °C, a long term operation resulted in a little aggregation
during the continuous mixing and transportation, and in a little
prolongation of the reaction time. The results are shown in Table 2.</p><heading>(Comparative Example 4): adding aqueous liquid and post-heating/but
no forcible cooling</heading><p num="0159">A comparative water-absorbent resin powder (3) was obtained in the
same way as of Example 14 except that the dry polymer (4) was got out of
the dryer without being forcible cooled, and immediately thereafter
pulverized. Next, the aqueous liquid was added to the water-absorbent
resin powder in the same way as of Example 15 except that the water-absorbent
resin powder (14) was replaced with the comparative water-absorbent
resin powder (3) of which the particle diameter distribution was
adjusted to not larger than 850 µm. As to the comparative water-absorbent
resin powder (3) as obtained without cooling to 40 to 80 °C,
even if the particle diameter distribution was adjusted to the same as of
Example 15, aggregation and adhesion in the mixer were gradually
observed and the continuous operation was difficult. The results are 
shown in Table 2.</p><heading>(Comparative Example 5): pulverization of dry polymer (5)/but no
forcible cooling</heading><p num="0160">The dry polymer (5) was treated in the same way as of Example 18
except that the dry polymer (5) was not forcibly cooled before being
supplied to the roll pulverizer. After 2 hours from the start of the
continuous pulverization, there began to occur the following troubles:
aggregate-derived extraordinary noises of the pulverizer; and adhesion of
the aggregate to the pulverizer. The particle diameter distribution of a
comparative water-absorbent resin powder (5) as obtained by the
pulverization is shown in Table 1.</p><heading>(Comparative Example 6): adding aqueous liquid and post-heating/but
no forcible cooling</heading><p num="0161">A comparative surface-crosslinked water-absorbent resin powder (6)
was obtained in the same way as of Example 19 except that the water-absorbent
resin powder (19) was replaced with the comparative water-absorbent
resin powder (5) as obtained in Comparative Example 5. The
results are shown in Table 2.</p><heading>(Example 22): preparation of sanitary material</heading><p num="0162">First, 50 parts by weight of the surface-crosslinked water-absorbent
resin powder (19) (as obtained in Example 19) and 50 parts by weight of
pulverized wood pulp were mixed together in a dry manner with a
mixer. Next, the resultant mixture was shaped into a web of the size of 12
cm × 38 cm by pneumatically molding the mixture. Then, this web was
pressed under a pressure of 2 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (about 193 kPa), thus obtaining an
absorbent structure (1) having a basis weight of about 526 g/m<sup>2</sup>. Next, this
absorbent structure (1) was inserted between a back sheet (liquid-impermeable 
sheet) with a leg gather and a liquid-permeable top sheet,
thus preparing a disposable diaper (1) having a weight of 47 g and a core
concentration of 50 weight %.</p><p num="0163">While a load of 20 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (about 1.93 kPa) was applied to the
disposable diaper (1) by a flat-plate-shaped weight, a physiological saline
solution was injected from a central hole of the plate into the disposable
diaper under the load. As a result, the disposable diaper (1), which was
prepared from the water-absorbent resin powder (19) as obtained by
undergoing the cooling step, exhibited a saturated absorbency of about 470
g.</p><heading>(Comparative Example 7): preparation of sanitary material</heading><p num="0164">A comparative disposable diaper (1) was obtained in the same way as
of Example 22 except that the water-absorbent resin powder (19) was
replaced with the comparative water-absorbent resin powder (6) as
obtained in Comparative Example 6. In the same way as of Example 22,
while a load of 20 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (about 1.93 kPa) was applied to the comparative
disposable diaper (1) by a flat-plate-shaped weight, a physiological saline
solution was injected from a central hole of the plate into the disposable
diaper under the load. As a result, the comparative disposable diaper (1)
exhibited a saturated absorbency of about 410 g and was therefore inferior
to the disposable diaper (1) which was prepared from the water-absorbent
resin powder (19) as obtained by undergoing the cooling step. <tables><table><tgroup cols="10"><tbody><row><entry namest="1" nameend="10">Particle diameter distribution and drying efficiency of

and 14 are included in the preferable scope of the present invention in
which the water-absorbent resin powder has an average particle diameter
of 200 to 600 µm after the pulverization step wherein the total ratio of
particles having particle diameters of not larger than 150 µm and particles
having particle diameters of not smaller than 850 µm in the water-absorbent 
resin powder is not more than 15 weight % of the water-absorbent
resin powder. On the other hand, as to Comparative Examples
1 and 2, it would be understood that the average particle diameter of the
water-absorbent resin powder deviates from the range of 200 to 600 µm
and further that the total ratio of particles having particle diameters of
not larger than 150 µm and particles having particle diameters of not
smaller than 850 µm in the water-absorbent resin powder is more than 15
weight % of the water-absorbent resin powder.</p><p num="0166">In addition, as is understood from the results shown in Table 1, the
on-sieve fractions (not smaller than 850 µm) deviating from the specified
particle diameter range are very much less in Examples 1 to 5 according to
the present invention in which the dry polymer is forcibly cooled
preferably into the range of 85 to 35 °C, more preferably 80 to 40 °C, still
more preferably 70 to 45 °C, after the heat-drying step than in
Comparative Examples 1 and 2 not according to the present invention in
which the forcible cooling was not carried out, therefore the average
particle diameter and the particle diameter distribution are excellent in
the present invention.</p><p num="0167">In addition, as is understood from the results shown in Table 1, as to
the present invention, the adhesion and clogging of the dry polymer to
the metal gauze also decreases, and the drying efficiency (drying speed,
uniformity) increases. In addition, it would also be understood that: the
difference between the effects at 40 °C and at 60 °C is not large, and cooling
to not lower than 60 °C is sufficient in consideration of the scale of the
cooling facilities. In addition, although not described in the table, the
water-absorbent resin powder according to the present invention shows
the advantage of little aggregating after the pulverization. </p><p num="0168">As is understood from the results shown in Table 2, as to the present
invention, the aqueous liquid is uniformly added, and the resultant
properties are therefore excellent. In addition, from comparison among
Examples 10 to 13, it would be understood that if the bulk density is not
less than 0.65 g/ml after the pulverization, the absorption capacity under
a load (especially 4.90 kPa) is also more enhanced. Incidentally, as is
shown in the parentheses in the table, the absorption capacities under
loads (1.93 kPa and 4.90 kPa) are little deteriorated by the impact, and the
impact resistance and the liquid permeability are also excellent. From
comparison among Examples 15 to 17, it would be understood that the
temperature of the powder and the internal wall temperature of the
mixer are important for the addition of the aqueous liquid.</p><p num="0169">Furthermore, the above working examples according to the present
invention are compared with regard to a series of continuous procedures.
The effects of the present invention are shown more remarkably when
continuously carrying out the production, especially, when carrying out
continuous drying and continuous pulverization of not less than 1
ton/day, preferably not less than 10 tons/day, of the water-absorbent resin
