method of reducing levels of tumor necrosis factor a and increasing cAMP levels and
treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and cancer in a mammal through the
administration thereof, and to pharmaceutical compositions of such derivatives.</p><heading><b><i>Background of the Invention</i></b></heading><p num="0002">Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a cytokine which is released primarily by cells of
immune systems in response to certain immunostimulators. When administered to
animals or humans, it causes inflammation, fever, cardiovascular effects, hemorrhage,
coagulation, cachexia, and acute phase responses similar to those seen during acute
infections, inflammatory diseases, and shock states. Excessive or unregulated TNFα
production has been implicated in a number of disease conditions. These include
endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome [<ref type="npl">Tracey, <i>et al., Nature</i> 330, 662-664 (1987)</ref>
and <ref type="npl">Hinshaw, <i>et al., Circ. Shock</i> 30, 279-292 (1990)</ref>], rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory
bowel disease, cachexia [<ref type="npl">Dezube, <i>et al., Lancet,</i> 335 (8690), 662 (1990)</ref>], and lupus.
TNFa concentration in excess of 12,000 pg/mL have been detected in pulmonary
aspirates from Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients [<ref type="npl">Millar, <i>et al.,
Lancet</i> 2(8665), 712-714 (1989)</ref>]. Systemic infusion of recombinant TNFα resulted in
changes typically seen in ARDS [<ref type="npl">Ferrai-Baliviera, <i>et al., Arch. Surg.</i> 124(12), 1400-1405
(1989)</ref>].</p><p num="0003">TNFα appears to be involved in a number of bone resorption diseases, including
arthritis. When activated, leukocytes will produce bone-resorption. TNFα apparently
contributes to this mechanism. [<ref type="npl">Bertolini, <i>et al., Nature</i> 319, 516-518 (1986)</ref> and
<ref type="npl">Johnson, <i>et al., Endocrinology</i> 124(3), 1424-1427 (1989)</ref>]. TNFα also has been shown 
to stimulate bone resorption and inhibit bone formation <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> through
stimulation of osteoclast formation and activation combined with inhibition of osteoblast
functions. Another compelling link with disease is the association between production
of TNFα by tumor or host tissues and malignancy associated hypercalcemia [<ref type="npl"><i>Calci.
Tissue Int. (US)</i> 46(Suppl.), S3-10 (1990)</ref>]. In Graft versus Host Reactions, increased
serum TNFα levels have been associated with major complication following acute
allogenic bone marrow transplants [<ref type="npl">Holler, <i>et al.</i>, <i>Blood</i>, 75(4), 1011-1016 (1990)</ref>].</p><p num="0004">Validation of TNF-α inhibition as a clinical therapy has been demonstrated by the
therapeutic use of TNF-α antibodies and soluble TNF-α receptors. TNFα blockage with
monoclonal anti-TNFα antibodies has been shown to be beneficial in rheumatoid
arthritis [<ref type="npl">Elliot, <i>et al., Int. J. Pharmac.</i> 1995 17(2), 141-145</ref>]. High levels of TNFα are
associated with Crohn's disease [<ref type="npl">von Dullemen, <i>et al., Gastroenterology,</i> 1995 109(1),
129-135</ref>] treatment with soluble TNFα receptor treatment gave clinical benefits.</p><p num="0005">Cerebral malaria is a lethal hyperacute neurological syndrome associated with high
blood levels of TNFα and the most severe complication occurring in malaria patients.
Elevated levels of serum TNFα correlated directly with the severity of disease and the
prognosis in patients with acute malaria attacks [<ref type="npl">Grau, <i>et al., N. Engl. J. Med.</i> 320(24),
1586-1591 (1989)</ref>].</p><p num="0006">TNFα plays a role in the area of chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases. The
deposition of silica particles leads to silicosis, a disease of progressive respiratory failure
caused by a fibrotic reaction. Antibodies to TNFα completely blocked the silica-induced
lung fibrosis in mice [<ref type="npl">Pignet, <i>et al., Nature,</i> 344, 245-247 (1990)</ref>]. High levels of
TNFα production (in the serum and in isolated macrophages) have been demonstrated
in animal models of silica and asbestos induced fibrosis [<ref type="npl">Bissonriette, <i>et al.,
Inflammation</i> 13(3), 329-339 (1989)</ref>]. Alveolar macrophages from pulmonary
sarcoidosis patients have also been found to spontaneously release massive quantities 
of TNFα as compared with macrophages from normal donors [<ref type="npl">Baughman, <i>et al., J. Lab.
Clin. Med.</i> 115(1), 36-42 (1990)</ref>].</p><p num="0007">Elevated levels of TNFα are implicated in reperfusion injury, the inflammatory
response which follows reperfusion, and is a major cause of tissue damage after blood
flow loss [<ref type="npl">Vedder, <i>et al.</i>, <i>PNAS</i> 87, 2643-2646 (1990)</ref>]. TNFα also alters the properties
of endothelial cells and has various pro-coagulant activities, such as producing an
increase in tissue factor pro-coagulant activity, suppressing the anticoagulant protein C
pathway, and down-regulating the expression of thrombomodulin [<ref type="npl">Sherry, <i>et al.</i>, <i>J. Cell
Biol.</i> 107, 1269-1277 (1988)</ref>]. TNFα has pro-inflammatory activities which together with
its early production (during the initial stage of an inflammatory event) make it a likely
mediator of tissue injury in several important disorders including but not limited to,
myocardial infarction, stroke and circulatory shock. TNFα-induced expression of
adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM) or endothelial
leukocyte adhesion molecules (ELAM) on endothelial cells may be especially important
[<ref type="npl">Munro, <i>et al.</i>, <i>Am. J. Path.</i> 135(1), 121-132 (1989)</ref>].</p><p num="0008">It has been reported that TNFα is a potent activator of retrovirus replication
including activation of HIV-1. [<ref type="npl">Duh, <i>et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.</i> 86, 5974-5978 (1989)</ref>;
<ref type="npl">Poll, <i>et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.</i> 87, 782-785 (1990)</ref>; <ref type="npl">Monto, <i>et al., Blood</i> 79, 2670
(1990)</ref>; <ref type="npl">Clouse, <i>et al.</i>, <i>J. Immunol.</i> 142, 431-438 (1989)</ref>; <ref type="npl">Poll, <i>et al., AIDS Res. Hum.
Retrovirus,</i> 191-197 (1992)</ref>]. At least three types or strains of HIV (<i>i.e.</i>, HIV-1, HIV-2
and HIV-3) have been identified. As a consequence of HIV infection, T-cell mediated
immunity is impaired and infected individuals manifest severe opportunistic infections
and/or unusual neoplasms. HIV entry into the T-lymphocyte requires T-lymphocyte
activation. Other viruses, such as HIV-1, HIV-2 infect T-lymphocytes after T-cell
activation. This virus protein expression and/or replication is mediated or maintained by
this T-cell activation. Once an activated T-lymphocyte is infected with HIV, the T-lymphocyte 
must continue to be maintained in an activated state to permit HIV gene
expression and/or HIV replication. Cytokines, specifically TNFα, are implicated in activated
T-cell mediated HIV protein expression and/or virus replication by playing a role in
maintaining T-lymphocyte activation. Therefore, interference with cytokine activity such
as prevention or inhibition of cytokine production, notably TNFα, in an HIV-infected individual
assists in limiting the maintenance of T-lymphocyte caused by HIV infection.</p><p num="0009">Monocytes, macrophages, and related cells, such as kupffer and glial cells, also
have been implicated in maintenance of the HIV infection. These cells, like T-cells, are
targets for viral replication and the level of viral replication is dependent upon the activation
state of the cells. [<ref type="npl">Rosenberg, <i>et al., The immunopathogenesis of HIV Infection,</i>
Advances in Immunology, 57 (1989)</ref>]. Cytokines, such as TNFα, have been shown to
activate HIV replication in monocytes and/or macrophages [<ref type="npl">Poli, <i>et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci.</i>, 87, 782-784 (1990)</ref>], therefore, prevention or inhibition of cytokine production or
activity aids in limiting HIV progression for T-cells. Additional studies have identified
TNFα as a common factor in the activation of HIV <i>in vitro</i> and have provided a clear
mechanism of action via a nuclear regulatory protein found in the cytoplasm of cells
[<ref type="npl">Osbom, <i>et al., PNAS</i> 86 2336-2340</ref>]. This evidence suggests that reducing TNFα
synthesis may have an antiviral effect in HIV infections, by reducing transcription and
thus virus production.</p><p num="0010">AIDS viral replication of latent HIV in T-cell and macrophage lines can be induced
by TNFα [<ref type="npl">Folks, <i>et al., PNAS</i> 86, 2365-2368 (1989)</ref>]. A molecular mechanism for the
virus inducing activity is suggested by TNFα's ability to activate a gene regulatory
protein (transcription factor, NFκB) found in the cytoplasm of cells, which promotes HIV
replication through binding to a viral regulatory gene sequence (LTR) [<ref type="npl">Osbom, <i>et al.</i>,
<i>PNAS</i> 86, 2336-2340 (1989)</ref>]. TNFα in AIDS associated cachexia is suggested by
elevated serum TNFα and high levels of spontaneous TNFα production in peripheral 
blood monocytes from patients [<ref type="npl">Wright, <i>et al., J. Immunol.</i> 141(1), 99-104 (1988)</ref>].
TNFα has been implicated in various roles with other viral infections. such as the
cytomegalia virus (CMV), influenza virus, adenovirus, and the herpes family of viruses
for similar reasons as those noted.</p><p num="0011">The nuclear factor κB (NFκB) is a plelotropic transcriptional activator (<ref type="npl">Lenardo, <i>et
al., Cell</i> 1989, 58, 227-29</ref>). NFκB has been implicated as a transcriptional activator in a
variety of disease and inflammatory states and is thought to regulate cytokine levels
including but not limited to TNFα and active HIV transcription [<ref type="npl">Dbaibo, <i>et al., J. Biol.
Chem.</i> 1993, 17782-66</ref>; <ref type="npl">Duh, <i>et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci.</i> 1989, 86, 5974-78</ref>;
<ref type="npl">Bachelerie, <i>et al.</i>, <i>Nature</i> 1991, 350, 709-12</ref>; <ref type="npl">Boswas, <i>et al., J. Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome</i> 1993, 6, 778-786</ref>; <ref type="npl">Suzuki, <i>et al., Biochem. And Biophys. Res.
Comm.</i> 1993, 193, 277-83</ref>; <ref type="npl">Suzuki, <i>et al., Biochem. And Biophys. Res Comm.</i> 1992,
189, 1709-15</ref>; <ref type="npl">Suzuki, <i>et al.</i>, <i>Biochem. Mol. Bio. Int.</i> 1993, 31(4), 693-700</ref>; <ref type="npl">Shakhov, <i>et

USA</i> 1990, 87, 9943-47</ref>]. Thus, it would be helpful to inhibit NFκB activation, nuclear
translation or binding to regulate transcription of cytokine gene(s) and through this
modulation and other mechanisms be useful to inhibit a multitude of disease states.</p><p num="0012">Many cellular functions are mediated by levels of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic
monophosphate (cAMP). Such cellular functions can contribute to inflammatory
conditions and diseases including asthma, inflammation, and other conditions (<ref type="npl">Lowe
and Cheng, <i>Drugs of the Future,</i> 17(9), 799-807, 1992</ref>). It has been shown that the
elevation of cAMP in inflammatory leukocytes inhibits their activation and the
subsequent release of inflammatory mediators, including TNFα and NFκB. increased
levels of cAMP also lead to the relaxation of airway smooth muscle.</p><p num="0013">The primary cellular mechanism for the inactivation of cAMP is the breakdown of
cAMP by a family of isoenzymes referred to as cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases 
(PDE) [<ref type="npl">Beavo and Reitsnyder, <i>Trends in Pharm.,</i> 11, 150-155, 1990</ref>]. There are ten
known members of the family of PDEs. It is well documented that the inhibition of PDE
type IV (PDE 4) enzyme is particularly effective in both the inhibition of inflammatory
mediator release and the relaxation of airway smooth muscle [<ref type="npl">Verghese, <i>et al.</i>, <i>Journal of
Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics,</i> 272(3), 1313-1320, 1995</ref>].</p><p num="0014">Decreasing TNFα levels and/or increasing cAMP levels thus constitutes a valuable
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of many inflammatory, infectious, immunological,
and malignant diseases. These include but are not restricted to: septic shock, sepsis,
endotoxic shock, hemodynamic shock and sepsis syndrome, post ischemic reperfusion
injury, malaria, mycobacterial infection, meningitis, psoriasis and other dermal diseases,
congestive heart failure, fibrotic disease, cachexia, graft rejection, cancer, tumor growth,
undesirable angiogenesis, autoimmune disease, opportunistic infections in AIDS,
rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, other arthritic conditions,
inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis,
systemic lupus erythrematosis, ENL in leprosy, radiation damage, and hyperoxic
alveolar injury. Prior efforts directed to the suppression of the effects of TNFα have
ranged from the utilization of steroids such as dexamethasone and prednisolone to the
use of both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies [<ref type="npl">Beutler, <i>et al., Science</i> 234, 470-474
(1985)</ref>; <ref type="patent">WO 92/11383</ref>].</p><p num="0015">Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel development and formation, plays
an important role in numerous normal and pathological physiological events.
Angiogenesis occurs in response to specific signals and involves a complex process
characterized by infiltration of the basal lamina by vascular endothelial cells in response
to angiogenic growth signals), migration of the endothelial cells toward the source of
the signal(s), and subsequent proliferation and formation of the capillary tube. Blood
flow through the newly formed capillary is initiated after the endothelial cells come into 
contact and connect with a preexisting capillary. Angiogenesis is required for tumor
growth beyond a certain size.</p><p num="0016">Inhibitory influences predominate in the naturally occurring balance between
endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis (<ref type="npl">Rastinejad, <i>et al.,</i> 1989, <i>Cell</i>
56:345-355</ref>]. In those rare instances in which neovascularization occurs under normal
physiological conditions, such as wound healing, organ regeneration, embryonic
development and female reproductive processes, angiogenesis is stringently regulated
and spatially and temporally delimited. Under conditions of pathological angiogenesis
such as that characterizing solid tumor growth, these regulatory controls fail.</p><p num="0017">Unregulated angiogenesis becomes pathologic and sustains progression of many
neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. A number of serious diseases are dominated
by abnormal neovascularization including solid tumor growth and metastases, arthritis,
some types of eye disorders, and psoriasis [<ref type="npl">Moses, <i>et al.,</i> 1991, <i>Biotech.</i> 9:630-634</ref>;

of pathological conditions, the process of angiogenesis contributes to the disease state.
For example, significant data suggests that the growth of solid tumors is dependent on
angiogenesis [<ref type="npl">Folkman and Klagsbrun, 1987, <i>Science</i> 235:442-447</ref>].</p><p num="0018">The maintenance of the avascularity of the cornea, lens, and trabecular meshwork

Currently, the treatment of these diseases, especially once neovascularization has

contributions of this process to pathological progression of the underlying disease states
as well as providing a valuable means of studying their etiology. For example, agents

used protamine to inhibit angiogenesis, [<ref type="npl">Taylor, <i>et al., Nature</i> 297:307 (1982)</ref>]. The
toxicity of protamine limits its practical use as a therapeutic. Folkman, <i>et al.</i> used

and <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,001,116 and 4,994,443</ref>]. Steroids, such as tetrahydrocortisol,
which lack gluco and mineral corticoid activity, are angiogenic inhibitors, interferon β is
also a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis induced by allogeneic spleen cells [<ref type="npl">Sidky, <i>et al.,</i>
Cancer Research 47:5155-5161 (1987)</ref>]. Human recombinant interferon-α was reported
to be successfully used in the treatment of pulmonary hemangiometosis, an

<i>et al.</i> reported that TNFα induces <i>in vivo</i> capillary blood vessel formation in the rat
cornea and the developing chick chorioallantoic membranes at very low doses and
suggested TNFα is a candidate for inducing angiogenesis in inflammation, wound
repair, and tumor growth [<ref type="npl"><i>Nature,</i> 329, 630-632 (1987)</ref>].</p><p num="0024">All of the various cell types of the body can be transformed into benign or malignant
tumor cells. The most frequent tumor site is lung, followed by colorectal, breast
prostate, bladder, pancreas, and then ovary. Other prevalent types of cancer include
leukemia, central nervous system cancers, brain cancer, melanoma, lymphoma,
erythroleukemia, uterine cancer, bone cancer, and head and neck cancer.</p><p num="0025">Cancer is now primarily treated with one or a combination of three types of
therapies: surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Surgery Involves the bulk removal of
diseased tissue. While surgery is sometimes effective in removing tumors located at
certain sites (<i>e.g.</i>, in the breast, colon, and skin) surgery cannot be used in the
treatment of tumors located in other areas (<i>e.g.</i>, the backbone) nor in the treatment of
disseminated neoplastic conditions (<i>e.g.</i>, leukemia). Chemotherapy involves the
disruption of cell replication or cell metabolism. Chemotherapy is used most often in the
treatment of leukemia, as well as breast, lung, and testicular cancer. </p><p num="0026">Chemotherapeutic agents are often referred to as antineoplastic agents. The
alkylating agents are believed to act by alkylating and cross-linking guanine and
possibly other bases in DNA, arresting cell division. Typical alkylating agents include
nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimine compounds, alkyl sulfates, cisplatin, and various
nitrosoureas. A disadvantage with these compounds is that they not only attack
malignant cells, but also other cells which are naturally dividing, such as those of bone
marrow, skin, gastro-intestinal mucosa, and fetal tissue. Antimetabolites are typically
reversible or irreversible enzyme inhibitors, or compounds that otherwise interfere with
the replication, translation or transcription of nucleic acids. Thus, it would be preferable
to find less toxic compounds for cancer treatment.</p><p num="0027">Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibition has been associated with several
activities including inhibition of TNFα [<ref type="npl">Mohler, <i>et al., Nature,</i> 370, 218-220 (1994)</ref>] and
inhibition of angiogenesis. MMPs are a family of secreted and membrane-bound zinc
endopeptidases that play a key role in both physiological and pathological tissue
degradation [<ref type="npl">Yu, <i>et al., Drugs &amp; Aging,</i> 1997, (3):229-244</ref>; <ref type="npl">Wojtowicz-Praga, <i>et al.. Int</i>.

components of the extracellular matrix, including fibrillar and non-fibrillar collagens.
fibronectin, laminin, and membrane glycoproteins. Ordinarily, there is a delicate
balance between cell division, matrix synthesis, matrix degradation (under the control of
cytokines), growth factors, and cell matrix interactions. Under pathological conditions,
however, this balance can be disrupted. Conditions and diseases associated with
undesired MMP levels include, but are not limited to: tumor metastasis invasion and
growth, angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteopenias such as
osteoporosis, periodontitis, gingivitis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and
corneal epidermal or gastric ulceration. </p><p num="0028">Increased MMP activity has been detected in a wide range of cancers [<ref type="npl">Denis, <i>et al.</i>,
