Actively growing tissues such as embryos and tumors require adequate blood supply. They satisfy this need by producing pro-angiogenic factors, which promote new blood vessel formation via a process called angiogenesis. Vascular tube formation is a complex but orderly biological event involving all or many of the following steps: a) Endothelial cells (ECs) proliferate from existing ECs or differentiate from progenitor cells; b) ECs migrate and coalesce to form cord-like structures; c) vascular cords then undergo tubulogenesis to form vessels with a central lumen d) existing cords or vessels send out sprouts to form secondary vessels; e) primitive vascular plexus undergo further remodeling and reshaping; and f) peri-endothelial cells are recruited to encase the endothelial tubes, providing maintenance and modulatory functions to the vessels; such cells including pericytes for small capillaries, smooth muscle cells for larger vessels, and myocardial cells in the heart. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hanahan, D.

These include solid tumors and metastasis, atherosclerosis, retrolental fibroplasia, hemangiomas, chronic inflammation, intraocular neovascular diseases such as proliferative retinopathies, e.g., diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), neovascular glaucoma, immune rejection of transplanted corneal tissue and other tissues, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Folkman et al., J.

Folkman et al., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nature 339:58 (1989)</bibl>. The neovascularization allows the tumor cells to acquire a growth advantage and proliferative autonomy compared to the normal cells. A tumor usually begins as a single aberrant cell which can proliferate only to a size of a few cubic millimeters due to the distance from available capillary beds, and it can stay 'dormant' without further growth and dissemination for a long period of time. Some tumor cells then switch to the angiogenic phenotype to activate endothelial cells, which proliferate and mature into new capillary blood vessels. These newly formed blood vessels not only allow for continued growth of the primary tumor, but also for the dissemination and recolonization of metastatic tumor cells. Accordingly, a correlation has been observed between density of microvessels in tumor sections and patient survival in breast cancer as well as in several other tumors. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Weidner et al., N. Engl. J. Med 324:1-6 (1991)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Horak et al., Lancet 340:1120-1124 (1992)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Macchiarini et al., Lancet 340:145-146 (1992)</bibl>. The precise mechanisms that control the angiogenic switch is not well understood, but it is believed that neovascularization of tumor mass results from the net balance of a multitude of angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Folkman Nat Med 1(1):27-31 (1995)</bibl>).</p><p>[0006]    It is currently accepted that metastases are responsible for the vast majority, estimated at 90%, of deaths from solid tumors (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gupta and Massague, Cell 127, 679-695 (2006)</bibl>). The complex process of metastasis involves a series of distinct steps including detachment of tumor cells from the primary tumor, intravasation of tumor cells into lymphatic or blood vessels, and extravasation and growth of tumor cells in secondary sites. Analysis of regional lymph nodes in many tumor types suggests that the lymphatic vasculature is an important route for the dissemination of human cancers. Furthermore, in almost all carcinomas, the presence of tumor cells in lymph nodes is an important adverse prognostic factor. While it was previously thought that such metastases exclusively involved passage of malignant cells along pre-existing lymphatic vessels near tumors, recent experimental studies and clinicopathological reports (reviewed in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Achen et al., Br J Cancer 94 (2006), 1355-1360</bibl> and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nathanson, Cancer 98, 413-423 (2003)</bibl>) suggest that lymphangiogenesis can be induced by solid tumors and can promote tumor spread. These and other recent studies suggest targeting lymphatics and lymphangiogenesis may be a useful therapeutic strategy to restrict the development of cancer metastasis, which would have a significant benefit for many patients.</p><p>[0007]    Also, the concentration levels of VEGF in eye fluids are highly correlated to the presence of active proliferation of blood vessels in patients with diabetic and other ischemia-related retinopathies. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Aiello et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 331:1480-1487 (1994)</bibl>. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated the localization of VEGF in choroidal neovascular membranes in patients affected by AMD. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lopez et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 37:855-868 (1996)</bibl>.</p><p>[0008]    In view of the role of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in many diseases and disorders, it is desirable to have a means of modulating one or more of the biological effects causing these processes. It is clear that despite the significant advancement in the treatment of cancer achieved by angiogenesis inhibitors such as bevacizumab, improved therapies are still being sought, especially those that further enhance the overall efficacy. The invention described herein meets this need and provides other benefits.</p><p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p><p>[0009]    The invention provides novel anti-VEGF-C antibodies and uses thereof. The present invention is based, at least in part, on experimental results obtained with anti-VEGF-C antibodies. Results obtained indicate that VEGF-C plays a role in angiogenesis as well as in modulating VEGF-C mediated lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) migration and proliferation. In addition, the results demonstrate that blocking VEGF-C leads to an inhibition of lymphangiogenesis and a reduction in lymph node and distal organ metastasis. Accordingly, VEGF-C antagonist, such as VEGF-C antibodies of the invention, as described herein, provide important therapeutic and diagnostic agents for use in targeting pathological conditions associated with activation of VEGF-C receptors.</p><p>[0010]    In one embodiment, an antibody that binds to VEGF-C or a fragment thereof is provided, wherein the antibody comprises at least one, two, three, four, five, or six HVRs selected from:

In the event that any definition set forth below conflicts with any document incorporated herein by reference, the definition set forth below shall control.</p><p>[0232]    The term "antibody" herein is used in the broadest sense and encompasses various immunoglobulin structures, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies, and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-binding activity.</p><p>[0233]    The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible mutations, e.g., naturally occurring mutations, that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments, such a monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target, wherein the target-binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example, the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones, such as a pool of hybridoma clones, phage clones, or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a selected target binding sequence can be further altered, for example, to improve affinity for the target, to humanize the target binding sequence, to improve its production in cell culture, to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo, to create a multispecific antibody, etc., and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity, monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.</p><p>[0234]    The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495-97 (1975)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hongo et al., Hybridoma, 14 (3): 253-260 (1995)</bibl>, <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)</bibl>), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat.

Chimeric antibodies include PRIMATIZED(R) antibodies wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by, e.g., immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.</p><p>[0236]    "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in which residues from a HVR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a HVR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit, or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances, FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge, but whose endogenous loci have been disabled, e.g., immunized xenomice (see, e.g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat.

USA, 103:3557-3562 (2006)</bibl> regarding human antibodies generated via a human B-cell hybridoma technology.</p><p>[0238]    A "species-dependent antibody" is one which has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second mammalian species. Normally, the species-dependent antibody "binds specifically" to a human antigen (i.e. has a binding affinity (Kd) value of no more than about 1*10&lt;-7 &gt;M, preferably no more than about 1*10&lt;-8 &gt;M and most preferably no more than about 1*10&lt;-9 &gt;M) but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second nonhuman mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold, or at least about 500 fold, or at least about 1000 fold, weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species-dependent antibody can be any of the various types of antibodies as defined above, but preferably is a humanized or human antibody.</p><p>[0239]    As used herein, "antibody mutant" or "antibody variant" refers to an amino acid sequence variant of the species-dependent antibody wherein one or more of the amino acid residues of the species-dependent antibody have been modified. Such mutants necessarily have less than 100% sequence identity or similarity with the species-dependent antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody mutant will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of the species-dependent antibody, in another embodiment at least 80%, in another embodiment at least 85%, in another embodiment at least 90%, and yet in another embodiment at least 95%. Identity or similarity with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical (i.e. same residue) or similar (i.e. amino acid residue from the same group based on common side-chain properties, see below) with the species-dependent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.</p><p>[0240]    An "isolated" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments, an antibody is purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of, for example, a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using, for example, Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.</p><p>[0241]    "Native antibodies" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.</p><p>[0242]    The "variable region" or "variable domain" of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domain of the heavy chain may be referred to as "VH." The variable domain of the light chain may be referred to as "VL." These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and contain the antigen-binding sites.</p><p>[0243]    The term "variable" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)</bibl>). The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.</p><p>[0244]    The "light chains" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa ([kappa]) and lambda ([lambda]), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.</p><p>[0245]    Depending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domains of their heavy chains, antibodies (immunoglobulins) can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, and IgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called [alpha], [delta], [epsilon], [gamma], and [mu], respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described generally in, for example, <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Abbas et al. Cellular and Mol. Immunology, 4th ed. (W.B. Saunders, Co., 2000)</bibl>. An antibody may be part of a larger fusion molecule, formed by covalent or non-covalent association of the antibody with one or more other proteins or peptides.</p><p>[0246]    The terms "full length antibody," "intact antibody" and "whole antibody" are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, not antibody fragments as defined below. The terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy chains that contain an Fc region.</p><p>[0247]    A "naked antibody" for the purposes herein is an antibody that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.</p><p>[0248]    "Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably comprising the antigen binding region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.</p><p>[0249]    Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual "Fc" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')2 fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.</p><p>[0250]    "Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-binding site. In one embodiment, a two-chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv (scFv) species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a "dimeric" structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three HVRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six HVRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.</p><p>[0251]    The Fab fragment contains the heavy- and light-chain variable domains and also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab')2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.</p><p>[0252]    "Single-chain Fv" or "scFv" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see, e.g., <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Pluckthün, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1994), pp. 269-315</bibl>.</p><p>[0253]    The term "diabodies" refers to antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH-VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies may be bivalent or bispecific. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">EP 404,097</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 1993/01161</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hudson et al., Nat.

Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hudson et al., Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003)</bibl>.</p><p>[0254]    The term "hypervariable region," "HVR," or "HV," when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH (H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. See, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Xu et al., Immunity 13:37-45 (2000)</bibl>; <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Johnson and Wu, in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., 2003)</bibl>. Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain.

Biol. 3:733-736 (1996)</bibl>.</p><p>[0255]    A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used (<bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed.

Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a "standard" Kabat numbered sequence.</p><p>[0259]    The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain (approximately residues 1-107 of the light chain and residues 1-113 of the heavy chain) (e.g., <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kabat et al., Sequences of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed.

The "EU numbering system" or "EU index" is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (e.g., the EU index reported in Kabat et al., supra). The "EU index as in Kabat" refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. Unless stated otherwise herein, references to residue numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. Unless stated otherwise herein, references to residue numbers in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system (e.g., see <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">United States Publication No. 2008/0181888</bibl>, Figures for EU numbering).</p><p>[0260]    The term "multispecific antibody" is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers an antibody that has polyepitopic specificity. Such multispecific antibodies include, but are not limited to, an antibody comprising a heavy chain variable domain (VH) and a light chain variable domain (VL), wherein the VHVL unit has polyepitopic specificity, antibodies having two or more VL and VH domains with each VHVL unit binding to a different epitope, antibodies having two or more single variable domains with each single variable domain binding to a different epitope, full length antibodies, antibody fragments such as Fab, Fv, dsFv, scFv, diabodies, bispecific diabodies and triabodies and antibody fragments that have been linked covalently or non-covalently. According to one embodiment the multispecific antibody is an IgG antibody that binds to each epitope with an affinity of 5 [mu]M to 0.001 pM, 3 [mu]M to 0.001 pM, 1 [mu]M to 0.001 pM, 0.5 [mu]M to 0.001 pM, or 0.1 [mu]M to 0.001 pM.</p><p>[0261]    "Polyepitopic specificity" refers to the ability to specifically bind to two or more different epitopes on the same or different antigen(s). For example, "bispecific" as used herein refers to the ability to bind two different epitopes. "Monospecific" refers to the ability to bind only one epitope.</p><p>[0262]    The expression "single domain antibodies" (sdAbs) or "single variable domain (SVD) antibodies" generally refers to antibodies in which a single variable domain (VH or VL) can confer antigen binding. In other words, the single variable domain does not need to interact with another variable domain in order to recognize the target antigen. Examples of single domain antibodies include those derived from camelids (lamas and camels) and cartilaginous fish (e.g., nurse sharks) and those derived from recombinant methods from humans and mouse antibodies (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nature (1989) 341:544-546</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Dev Comp Immunol (2006) 30:43-56</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Trend Biochem Sci (2001) 26:230-235</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Trends Biotechnol (2003):21:484-490</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 2005/035572</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 03/035694</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Febs Lett (1994) 339:285-290</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO00/29004</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 02/051870</bibl>).</p><p>[0263]    The expression "linear antibodies" generally refers to the antibodies described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Zapata et al., Protein Eng. 8(10):1057-1062 (1995)</bibl>. Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (VH-CH1-VH-CH1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.</p><p>[0264]    An "affinity matured" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s).

Examples of antibody effector functions include: C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor); and B cell activation.</p><p>[0269]    The term "Fc region" herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed, antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.</p><p>[0270]    A "functional Fc region" possesses an "effector function" of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary "effector functions" include C1q binding; CDC; Fc receptor binding; ADCC; phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g., an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays as disclosed, for example, in definitions herein.</p><p>[0271]    A "native sequence Fc region" comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature.

The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90% homology therewith, more preferably at least about 95% homology therewith.</p><p>[0273]    "Fc receptor" or "FcR" describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In some embodiments, an FcR is a native human FcR. In some embodiments, an FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc[gamma]RI, Fc[gamma]RII, and Fc[gamma]RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of those receptors. Fc[gamma]RII receptors include Fc[gamma]RIIA (an "activating receptor") and Fc[gamma]RIIB (an "inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc[gamma]RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc[gamma]RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain.

Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, "binding affinity" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following.</p><p>[0281]    In one embodiment, the "Kd" or "Kd value" according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (&lt;125&gt;I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Chen, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999)</bibl>). To establish conditions for the assay, MICROTITER(R) multi-well plates (Thermo Scientific) are coated overnight with 5 [mu]g/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23[deg.] C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [&lt;125&gt;I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Presta et al., Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599 (1997)</bibl>). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% TWEEN-20(TM) in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 [mu]l/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20(TM); Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT(TM) gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.</p><p>[0282]    According to another embodiment, the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE(R)-2000 or a BIACORE(R)-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25[deg.] C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at ~10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 [mu]g/ml (~0.2 [mu]M) before injection at a flow rate of 5 [mu]l/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% TWEEN-20(TM) surfactant (PBST) at 25[deg.] C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 [mu]l/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE(R) Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio koff/kon. See, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Chen et al., J. Mol.

&lt;tb&gt;See FIG. 5.</p><p>[0290]    As used herein, "codon set" refers to a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized, for example, by solid phase synthesis, including sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. A standard form of codon designation is that of the IUB code, which is known in the art and described herein. A codon set typically is represented by 3 capital letters in italics, e.g., NNK, NNS, XYZ, DVK and the like. A "non-random codon set", as used herein, thus refers to a codon set that encodes select amino acids that fulfill partially, preferably completely, the criteria for amino acid selection as described herein. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide "degeneracy" at certain positions is well known in that art, for example the TRIM approach (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Knappek et al. (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 296:57-86</bibl>); <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Garrard &amp; Henner (1993) Gene 128:103</bibl>). Such sets of oligonucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers (available from, for example, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), or can be obtained commercially (for example, from Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.). Therefore, a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences, the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides, as used according to the invention, have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic acid template and also can, but does not necessarily, include restriction enzyme sites useful for, for example, cloning purposes.</p><p>[0291]    The expression "linear antibodies" refers to the antibodies described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Zapata et al. (1995 Protein Eng, 8(10):1057-1062)</bibl>. Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (VH-CH1-VH-CH1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.</p><p>[0292]    As used herein, "library" refers to a plurality of antibody or antibody fragment sequences (for example, polypeptides of the invention), or the nucleic acids that encode these sequences, the sequences being different in the combination of variant amino acids that are introduced into these sequences according to the methods of the invention.</p><p>[0293]    "Phage display" is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to at least a portion of coat protein on the surface of phage, e.g., filamentous phage, particles. A utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of randomized protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target antigen with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent phage display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small proteins through fusions to either gene III or gene VIII of filamentous phage. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wells and Lowman (1992) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 3:355-362</bibl>, and references cited therein. In a monovalent phage display, a protein or peptide library is fused to a gene III or a portion thereof, and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type gene III protein so that phage particles display one copy or none of the fusion proteins. Avidity effects are reduced relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand affinity, and phagemid vectors are used, which simplify DNA manipulations. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lowman and Wells (1991) Methods: A companion to Methods in Enzymology 3:205-0216</bibl>.</p><p>[0294]    A "phagemid" is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication, e.g., Co1E1, and a copy of an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on any known bacteriophage, including filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage. The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable marker for antibiotic resistance. Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids. When cells harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage particles, the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to generate copies of one strand of the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The phagemid may form infectious or non-infectious phage particles. This term includes phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to a heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is displayed on the surface of the phage particle.</p><p>[0295]    The term "phage vector" means a double stranded replicative form of a bacteriophage containing a heterologous gene and capable of replication. The phage vector has a phage origin of replication allowing phage replication and phage particle formation. The phage is preferably a filamentous bacteriophage, such as an M13, fl, fd, Pf3 phage or a derivative thereof, or a lambdoid phage, such as lambda, 21, phi80, phi81, 82, 424, 434, etc., or a derivative thereof.</p><p>[0296]    As used herein, "solvent accessible position" refers to a position of an amino acid residue in the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of a source antibody or antigen binding fragment that is determined, based on structure, ensemble of structures and/or modeled structure of the antibody or antigen binding fragment, as potentially available for solvent access and/or contact with a molecule, such as an antibody-specific antigen. These positions are typically found in the CDRs and on the exterior of the protein. The solvent accessible positions of an antibody or antigen binding fragment, as defined herein, can be determined using any of a number of algorithms known in the art. In one embodiment, solvent accessible positions are determined using coordinates from a 3-dimensional model of an antibody, preferably using a computer program such as the InsightII program (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.). Solvent accessible positions can also be determined using algorithms known in the art (e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lee and Richards (1971) J. Mol. Biol. 55, 379</bibl> and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Connolly (1983) J. Appl. Cryst. 16, 548</bibl>). Determination of solvent accessible positions can be performed using software suitable for protein modeling and 3-dimensional structural information obtained from an antibody. Software that can be utilized for these purposes includes SYBYL Biopolymer Module software (Tripos Associates). Generally, where an algorithm (program) requires a user input size parameter, the "size" of a probe which is used in the calculation is set at about 1.4 Angstrom or smaller in radius. In addition, determination of solvent accessible regions and area methods using software for personal computers has been described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Pacios (1994) Comput. Chem. 18(4): 377-386</bibl>.</p><p>[0297]    The process of vascular development is tightly regulated. To date, a significant number of molecules, mostly secreted factors produced by surrounding cells, have been shown to regulate EC differentiation, proliferation, migration and coalescence into cord-like structures. For example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as the key factor involved in stimulating angiogenesis and in inducing vascular permeability. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ferrara et al., Endocr. Rev. 18:4-25 (1997)</bibl>. The finding that the loss of even a single VEGF allele results in embryonic lethality points to an irreplaceable role played by this factor in the development and differentiation of the vascular system. Furthermore, VEGF has been shown to be a key mediator of neovascularization associated with tumors and intraocular disorders. Ferrara et al., Endocr. Rev. supra. The VEGF mRNA is overexpressed by the majority of human tumors examined. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Berkman et al., J. Clin.

It should be understood that the anti-angiogenesis agent includes those agents that bind and block the angiogenic activity of the angiogenic factor or its receptor. For example, an anti-angiogenesis agent is an antibody or other antagonist to an angiogenic agent as defined above, e.g., antibodies to VEGF-A or to the VEGF-A receptor (e.g., KDR receptor or Flt-1 receptor), anti-PDGFR inhibitors such as Gleevec(TM) (Imatinib Mesylate), small molecules that block VEGF receptor signaling (e.g., PTK787/ZK2284, SU6668, SUTENT(R)/SU11248 (sunitinib malate), AMG706, or those described in, e.g., international patent application <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 2004/113304</bibl>).

Sometimes the VEGF from a specific species are indicated by terms such as hVEGF for human VEGF, mVEGF for murine VEGF, and etc. The term "VEGF" is also used to refer to truncated forms of the polypeptide comprising amino acids 8 to 109 or 1 to 109 of the 165-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor. Reference to any such forms of VEGF may be identified in the present application, e.g., by "VEGF (8-109)," "VEGF (1-109)" or "VEGF165." The amino acid positions for a "truncated" native VEGF are numbered as indicated in the native VEGF sequence. For example, amino acid position 17 (methionine) in truncated native VEGF is also position 17 (methionine) in native VEGF. The truncated native VEGF has binding affinity for the KDR and Flt-1 receptors comparable to native VEGF.</p><p>[0303]    A "VEGF antagonist" refers to a molecule capable of neutralizing, blocking, inhibiting, abrogating, reducing or interfering with VEGF activities including, but not limited to, its binding to one or more VEGF receptors. VEGF antagonists include, without limitation, anti-VEGF antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, receptor molecules and derivatives which bind specifically to VEGF thereby sequestering its binding to one or more receptors, anti-VEGF receptor antibodies and VEGF receptor antagonists such as small molecule inhibitors of the VEGFR tyrosine kinases. The term "VEGF antagonist," as used herein, specifically includes molecules, including antibodies, antibody fragments, other binding polypeptides, peptides, and non-peptide small molecules, that bind to VEGF and are capable of neutralizing, blocking, inhibiting, abrogating, reducing or interfering with VEGF activities. Thus, the term "VEGF activities" specifically includes VEGF mediated biological activities of VEGF.</p><p>[0304]    An "anti-VEGF antibody" is an antibody that binds to VEGF with sufficient affinity and specificity.

An anti-VEGF antibody will usually not bind to other VEGF homologues such as VEGF-B or VEGF-C, nor other growth factors such as PlGF, PDGF or bFGF. In one embodiment, anti-VEGF antibodies include a monoclonal antibody that binds to the same epitope as the monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody A4.6.1 produced by hybridoma ATCC HB 10709; a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (see <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Presta et al.

AVASTIN(R) is presently commercially available. Bevacizumab comprises mutated human IgG1 framework regions and antigen-binding complementarity-determining regions from the murine antibody A.4.6.1 that blocks binding of human VEGF to its receptors. Approximately 93% of the amino acid sequence of bevacizumab, including most of the framework regions, is derived from human IgG1, and about 7% of the sequence is derived from A4.6.1.

In addition, blockade of VEGF-C-mediated signaling has been shown to suppress tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastases in mice (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Chen et al., Cancer Res 65, 9004-9011 (2005)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">He et al., J.

In one embodiment, active fragments include any portions of the full-length amino acid sequence which have less than the full 419 amino acids of the full-length amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:87. Such active fragments contain VEGF-C biological activity and include, but not limited to, mature VEGF-C. In one embodiment, the full-length VEGF-C polypeptide is proteolytically processed produce a mature form of VEGF-C polypeptide, also referred to as mature VEGF-C. Such processing includes cleavage of a signal peptide and cleavage of an amino-terminal peptide (corresponding approximately to amino acids 1-102 of SEQ ID NO:87) and cleavage of a carboxyl-terminal peptide (corresponding approximately to amino acids 228-419 of SEQ ID NO:87) to produced a fully-processed mature form (see FIG. 6). Experimental evidence demonstrates that the full-length VEGF-C, partially-processed forms of VEGF-C and fully processed mature forms of VEGF-C are able to bind VEGFR3 (Flt-4 receptor). However, high affinity binding to VEGFR2 occurs only with the fully processed mature forms of VEGF-C.</p><p>[0310]    The term "VEGF-C" also refers to VEGF-C from non-human species such as mouse, rat or primate. Sometimes the VEGF-C from a specific species are indicated by terms such as hVEGF-C for human VEGF-C, mVEGF-C for murine VEGF-C, and etc.</p><p>[0311]    The terms "C137S", "VEGF-C C137S", "vascular endothelial growth factor-C C137S", "VEGFC C137S" and "hVEGF-C C137S" are used interchangeably, and refer to the full-length polypeptide and the fragments of the full-length polypeptide wherein the cysteine residue at amino acid residue position 137 was replaced by a serine residue as shown in SEQ ID NO:88.</p><p>[0312]    The term "VEGF-C antagonist" is used herein to refer to a molecule capable of neutralizing, blocking, inhibiting, abrogating, reducing or interfering with VEGF-C activities. In certain embodiments, VEGF-C antagonist refers to a molecule capable of neutralizing, blocking, inhibiting, abrogating, reducing or interfering with the ability of VEGF-C to modulate angiogenesis, lymphatic endothelial cell (EC) migration, proliferation or adult lymphangiogenesis, especially tumoral lymphangiogenesis and tumor metastasis. VEGF-C antagonists include, without limitation, anti-VEGF-C antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, receptor molecules and derivatives which bind specifically to VEGF-C thereby sequestering its binding to one or more receptors, anti-VEGF-C receptor antibodies and VEGF-C receptor antagonists such as small molecule inhibitors of the VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. The term "VEGF-C antagonist," as used herein, specifically includes molecules, including antibodies, antibody fragments, other binding polypeptides, peptides, and non-peptide small molecules, that bind to VEGF-C and are capable of neutralizing, blocking, inhibiting, abrogating, reducing or interfering with VEGF-C activities. Thus, the term "VEGF-C activities" specifically includes VEGF-C mediated biological activities (as hereinabove defined) of VEGF-C.</p><p>[0313]    The term "anti-VEGF-C antibody" or "an antibody that binds to VEGF-C" refers to an antibody that is capable of binding VEGF-C with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting VEGF-C. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an anti-VEGF-C antibody to an unrelated, non-VEGF-C protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to VEGF-C as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to VEGF-C has a dissociation constant (Kd) of &lt;=1 [mu]M, &lt;=100 nM, &lt;=10 nM, &lt;=1 nM, or &lt;=0.1 nM. In certain embodiments, an anti-VEGF-C antibody binds to an epitope of VEGF-C that is conserved among VEGF-C from different species.</p><p>[0314]    The term "biological activity" and "biologically active" with regard to a VEGF-C polypeptide refer to physical/chemical properties and biological functions associated with full-length and/or mature VEGF-C. In some embodiments, VEGF-C "biological activity" means having the ability to bind to, and stimulate the phosphorylation of, the Flt-4 receptor (VEGFR3). Generally, VEGF-C will bind to the extracellular domain of the Flt-4 receptor and thereby activate or inhibit the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain thereof. Consequently, binding of VEGF-C to the receptor may result in enhancement or inhibition of proliferation and/or differentiation and/or activation of cells having the Flt-4 receptor for the VEGF-C in vivo or in vitro. Binding of VEGF-C to the Flt-4 receptor can be determined using conventional techniques, including competitive binding methods, such as RIAs, ELISAs, and other competitive binding assays. Ligand/receptor complexes can be identified using such separation methods as filtration, centrifugation, flow cytometry (see, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lyman et al., Cell, 75:1157-1167 [1993]</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Urdal et al., J. Biol. Chem., 263:2870-2877 [1988]</bibl>; and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gearing et al., EMBO J., 8:3667-3676 [1989]</bibl>), and the like. Results from binding studies can be analyzed using any conventional graphical representation of the binding data, such as Scatchard analysis (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Scatchard, Ann. NY Acad. Sci., 51:660-672 [1949]</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Goodwin et al., Cell, 73:447-456 [1993]</bibl>), and the like. Since VEGF-C induces phosphorylation of the Flt-4 receptor, conventional tyrosine phosphorylation assays can also be used as an indication of the formation of a Flt-4 receptor/VEGF-C complex. In another embodiment, VEGF-C "biological activity" means having the ability to bind to KDR receptor (VEGFR2). vascular permeability, as well as the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. In certain embodiments, binding of VEGF-C to the KDR receptor may result in enhancement or inhibition of vascular permeability as well as migration and/or proliferation and/or differentiation and/or activation of endothelial cells having the KDR receptor for the VEGF-C in vivo or in vitro.</p><p>[0315]    As used herein, "treatment" (and variations such as "treat" or "treating") refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder or to slow the progression of a disease or disorder.</p><p>[0316]    "Chronic" administration refers to administration of the agent(s) in a continuous mode as opposed to an acute mode, so as to maintain the initial therapeutic effect (activity) for an extended period of time. "Intermittent" administration is treatment that is not consecutively done without interruption, but rather is cyclic in nature.</p><p>[0317]    A "disorder" is any condition that would benefit from treatment. For example, mammals who suffer from or need prophylaxis against abnormal angiogenesis (excessive, inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis) or vascular permeability. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include malignant and benign tumors; non-leukemias and lymphoid malignancies; and, in particular, tumor (cancer) metastasis.</p><p>[0318]    The terms "cell proliferative disorder" and "proliferative disorder" refer to disorders that are associated with some degree of abnormal cell proliferation. In one embodiment, the cell proliferative disorder is cancer.</p><p>[0319]    "Tumor," as used herein, refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues.

Yet, in some embodiments, the cancer is selected from the group consisting of non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, renal cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma and breast carcinoma, including metastatic forms of those cancers.</p><p>[0321]    By "metastasis" is meant the spread of cancer from its primary site to other places in the body. Cancer cells can break away from a primary tumor, penetrate into lymphatic and blood vessels, circulate through the bloodstream, and grow in a distant focus (metastasize) in normal tissues elsewhere in the body. Metastasis can be local or distant. Metastasis is a sequential process, contingent on tumor cells breaking off from the primary tumor, traveling through the bloodstream or lymphatics, and stopping at a distant site. At the new site, the cells establish a blood supply and can grow to form a life-threatening mass. In certain embodiments, the term metastatic tumor refers to a tumor that is capable of metastasizing, but has not yet metastasized to tissues or organs elsewhere in the body. In certain embodiments, the term metastatic tumor refers to a tumor that has metastasized to tissues or organs elsewhere in the body.</p><p>[0322]    The "metastatic organ" or "metastatic tissue" is used in the broadest sense, refers to an organ or a tissue in which the cancer cells from a primary tumor or the cancer cells from another part of the body have spread.

A therapeutically effective amount encompasses an amount in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance/molecule are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A "prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, but not necessarily, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount would be less than the therapeutically effective amount.</p><p>[0339]    The term "efficacy" is used herein in the broadest sense and refers to immunoglobuin's, antibody's or Fc fusion protein's ability to produce a desired effect.

The treatment is considered therapeutic if there is, for example, a reduction in the growth or metastasis of cancerous cells, amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with cancer, or a decrease in mortality and/or morbidity following administration of an antibody, a fusion protein, a conjugated molecule, or a composition of the invention. Antibodies, fusion proteins or compositions of the invention can be tested for their ability to reduce tumor formation in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays. For cancer therapy, efficacy in vivo can, for example, be also measured by assessing the duration of survival, time to disease progression (TTP), the response rates (RR), duration of response, and/or quality of life.</p><p>[0342]    Clinical benefit can be measured by assessing various endpoints, e.g., inhibition, to some extent, of disease progression, including slowing down and complete arrest; reduction in the number of disease episodes and/or symptoms; reduction in lesion size; inhibition (i.e., reduction, slowing down or complete stopping) of disease cell infiltration into adjacent peripheral organs and/or tissues; inhibition (i.e. reduction, slowing down or complete stopping) of disease spread; decrease of auto-immune response, which may, but does not have to, result in the regression or ablation of the disease lesion; relief, to some extent, of one or more symptoms associated with the disorder; increase in the length of disease-free presentation following treatment, e.g., progression-free survival; increased overall survival; higher response rate; and/or decreased mortality at a given point of time following treatment.</p><p>[0343]    By "maintenance therapy" is meant a therapeutic regimen that is given to reduce the likelihood of disease recurrence or progression.

They may be hormones themselves. Examples include anti-estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including, for example, tamoxifen (including NOLVADEX(R) tamoxifen), raloxifene (EVISTA(R)), droloxifene, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, trioxifene, keoxifene, LY117018, onapristone, and toremifene (FARESTON(R)); anti-progesterones; estrogen receptor down-regulators (ERDs); agents that function to suppress or shut down the ovaries, for example, leutinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists such as leuprolide acetate (LUPRON(R) and ELIGARD(R)), goserelin acetate, buserelin acetate and tripterelin; other anti-androgens such as flutamide, nilutamide and bicalutamide; and aromatase inhibitors that inhibit the enzyme aromatase, which regulates estrogen production in the adrenal glands, such as, for example, 4(5)-imidazoles, aminoglutethimide, megestrol acetate (MEGASE(R)), exemestane (AROMASIN(R)), formestanie, fadrozole, vorozole (RIVISOR(R)), letrozole (FEMARA(R)), and anastrozole (ARIMIDEX(R)). In addition, such definition of chemotherapeutic agents includes bisphosphonates such as clodronate (for example, BONEFOS(R) or OSTAC(R)), etidronate (DIDROCAL(R)), NE-58095, zoledronic acid/zoledronate (ZOMETA(R)), alendronate (FOSAMAX(R)), pamidronate (AREDIA(R)), tiludronate (SKELID(R)), or risedronate (ACTONEL(R)); as well as troxacitabine (a 1,3-dioxolane nucleoside cytosine analog); antisense oligonucleotides, particularly those that inhibit expression of genes in signaling pathways implicated in abherant cell proliferation, such as, for example, PKC-alpha, Raf, H-Ras, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R); vaccines such as THERATOPE(R) vaccine and gene therapy vaccines, for example, ALLOVECTIN(R) vaccine, LEUVECTIN(R) vaccine, and VAXID(R) vaccine; topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (e.g., LURTOTECAN(R)); rmRH (e.g., ABARELIX(R)); lapatinib ditosylate (an ErbB-2 and EGFR dual tyrosine kinase small-molecule inhibitor also known as GW572016); COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib (CELEBREX(R); 4-(5-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)benzenesulfonamide; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, acids or derivatives of any of the above.</p><p>[0356]    A "growth inhibitory agent" when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell (such as a cell expressing VEGF-C or cells acted upon by VEGF-C) either in vitro or in vivo. In one embodiment, growth inhibitory agent is growth inhibitory antibody that prevents or reduces proliferation of a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibody binds. In another embodiment, the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression (at a place other than S phase), such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M-phase arrest. Classical M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes, and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and ara-C.

Docetaxel (TAXOTERE(R), Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), derived from the European yew, is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel (TAXOL(R), Bristol-Myers Squibb). Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.</p><p>[0357]    The "pathology" of a disease includes all phenomena that compromise the well-being of the patient. For cancer, this includes, without limitation, abnormal or uncontrollable cell growth, metastasis, interference with the normal functioning of neighboring cells, release of cytokines or other secretory products at abnormal levels, suppression or aggravation of inflammatory or immunological response, etc.</p><p>[0358]    The term "prodrug" as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wilman (1986) "Prodrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy" Biochemical Society Transactions, 14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast</bibl> and <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Stella et al.

The prodrugs of this invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated prodrugs, [beta]-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above.</p><p>[0359]    A "small molecule" is defined herein to have a molecular weight below about 500 Daltons.</p><p>[0360]    "Purified" means that a molecule is present in a sample at a concentration of at least 95% by weight, or at least 98% by weight of the sample in which it is contained.</p><p>[0361]    An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is separated from at least one other nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated, for example, in its natural environment. An isolated nucleic acid molecule further includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the nucleic acid molecule, but the nucleic acid molecule is present extrachromosomally or at a chromosomal location that is different from its natural chromosomal location.</p><p>[0362]    The term "vector," as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a "plasmid," which refers to a circular double stranded DNA into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as "recombinant expression vectors," or simply, "expression vectors." In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, "plasmid" and "vector" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.</p><p>[0363]    "Polynucleotide," or "nucleic acid," as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may comprise modification(s) made after synthesis, such as conjugation to a label. Other types of modifications include, for example, "caps," substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotides(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid or semi-solid supports. The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2'-O-methyl-, 2'-O-allyl-, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, [alpha]-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs, and basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S ("thioate"), P(S)S ("dithioate"), (O)NR2 ("amidate"), P(O)R, P(O)OR', CO, or CH2 ("formacetal"), in which each R or R' is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (-O-) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.</p><p>[0364]    "Oligonucleotide," as used herein, generally refers to short, generally single-stranded, generally synthetic polynucleotides that are generally, but not necessarily, less than about 200 nucleotides in length. The terms "oligonucleotide" and "polynucleotide" are not mutually exclusive. The description above for polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.</p><p>[0365]    "Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity" with respect to a reference polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the reference polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for aligning sequences, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc., and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available from Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif., or may be compiled from the source code. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.</p><p>[0366]    In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:</p><p>[0000]    
100 times the fraction X/Y</p><p>[0000]    where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer program.</p><p>[0367]    The expression "control sequences" refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.</p><p>[0368]    Nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, "operably linked" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.</p><p>[0369]    As used herein, the expressions "cell," "cell line," and "cell culture" are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words "transformants" and "transformed cells" include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.</p><p>[0370]    "Cancer recurrence" herein refers to a return of cancer following treatment. In one embodiment, cancer recurrence includes return of cancer in the breast, as well as distant recurrence, where the cancer returns outside of the breast.</p><p>Compositions of the Invention</p><p>[0371]    A key event in the multi-step process of metastasis involves the egress of a tumor cell away from the primary tumor mass. For solid tumors, the lymphatic system often provides a route for the departing cells. VEGF-C is known to be a key modulator of angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and metastasis in many tumor models, and inhibition of the VEGF-C axis is considered a promising strategy for inhibiting the development of metastasis.</p><p>[0372]    The studies underlying the present invention, which are presented in the examples below, support an important role of VEGF-C in angiogenesis, tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. Additionally, the data set forth in the Examples demonstrate the presence of functional lymphatic vessels within tumors and show that treating with anti-VEGF-C results in a reduction of these functional lymphatics. See also FIGS. 7-9, 12-14 and 22</p><p>[0373]    The invention encompasses isolated antibody and polynucleotide embodiments. In one embodiment, an anti-VEGF-C antibody is purified.</p><p>[0374]    This invention also encompasses compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions, comprising an anti-VEGF-C antibody; and polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding an anti-VEGF-C antibody. As used herein, compositions comprise one or more antibodies that bind to VEGF-C, and/or one or more polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding one or more antibodies that bind to VEGF-C. These compositions may further comprise suitable carriers, such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including buffers, which are well known in the art.</p><p>[0375]    In one embodiment, the anti-VEGF-C antibodies of the invention are monoclonal. In yet another embodiment, the anti-VEGF-C antibodies are polyclonal. Also encompassed within the scope of the invention are Fab, Fab', Fab'-SH and F(ab')2 fragments of the anti-VEGF-C antibodies provided herein. These antibody fragments can be created by traditional means, such as enzymatic digestion, or may be generated by recombinant techniques. Such antibody fragments may be chimeric or humanized. These fragments are useful for the diagnostic and purposes set forth below. In one embodiment, an anti-VEGF-C antibody is a chimeric, humanized, or human antibody.</p><p>[0376]    Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies.</p><p>[0377]    Exemplary monoclonal antibodies derived from a phage library are provided herein and described in Example 1.

In another aspect, the invention provides an antibody that binds to the same epitope on VEGF-C as any of the above-mentioned antibodies.</p><p>Antibody Fragments</p><p>[0420]    The present invention encompasses antibody fragments. Antibody fragments may be generated by traditional means, such as enzymatic digestion, or by recombinant techniques. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to solid tumors. For a review of certain antibody fragments, see <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hudson et al. (2003) Nat. Med. 9:129-134</bibl>.</p><p>[0421]    Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Morimoto et al., Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117 (1992)</bibl>; and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985)</bibl>). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from E. coli, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab')2 fragments (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)</bibl>). According to another approach, F(ab')2 fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab')2 fragment with increased in vivo half-life comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046</bibl>. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In certain embodiments, an antibody is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 93/16185</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894; and 5,587,458</bibl>. Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they may be suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. scFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an scFv. See <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Antibody Engineering, ed. Borrebaeck, supra</bibl>. The antibody fragment may also be a "linear antibody", e.g., as described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870</bibl>, for example. Such linear antibodies may be monospecific or bispecific.</p><p>Humanized Antibodies</p><p>[0422]    The invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are known in the art. For example, a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as "import" residues, which are typically taken from an "import" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Jones et al. (1986) Nature 321:522-525</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Riechmann et al. (1988) Nature 332:323-327</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Verhoeyen et al. (1988) Science 239:1534-1536</bibl>), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such "humanized" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567</bibl>) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.</p><p>[0423]    The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies can be important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called "best-fit" method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody. See, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sims et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 151:2296</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Chothia et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901</bibl>. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies. See, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Carter et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Presta et al. (1993) J. Immunol., 151:2623</bibl>.</p><p>[0424]    It is further generally desirable that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to one method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.</p><p>Human Antibodies</p><p>[0425]    Human antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence(s) selected from human-derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences(s) as described above. Alternatively, human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described, for example, by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kozbor J. Immunol., 133: 3001 (1984)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)</bibl>; and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Boerner et al., J. Immunol., 147: 86 (1991)</bibl>.</p><p>[0426]    It is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 2551 (1993)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Jakobovits et al., Nature, 362: 255 (1993)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bruggermann et al., Year in Immunol., 7: 33 (1993)</bibl>.</p><p>[0427]    Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non-human, e.g. rodent, antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non-human antibody. According to this method, which is also called "epitope imprinting", either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non-human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described herein is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating a population of non-human chain/human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non-human chain/human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non-human chain in the primary phage display clone, i.e. the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non-human chain, a human antibody is obtained (see <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">PCT WO 93/06213</bibl> published Apr. 1, 1993). Unlike traditional humanization of non-human antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no FR or CDR residues of non-human origin.</p><p>Multispecific Antibodies</p><p>[0428]    One example of a multispecific antibody of this invention includes an antibody that binds to VEGF-C and to another antigen. In other embodiments, multispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of VEGF-C. Multispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express VEGF-C. These antibodies possess a VEGF-C-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent, such as, e.g., saporin, anti-interferon-[alpha], vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten. Multispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab')2 bispecific antibodies).</p><p>[0429]    Various methods for making bispecific antibodies have been described in the art. One of the first approaches involved co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Milstein and Cuello, Nature, 305: 537 (1983)</bibl>). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 93/08829</bibl> published May 13, 1993, and in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10: 3655 (1991)</bibl>.</p><p>[0430]    According to a different approach, antibody variable domains are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion, for example, is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. In certain embodiments, the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) is present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.</p><p>[0431]    In one embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 94/04690</bibl>. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology, 121:210 (1986)</bibl>.</p><p>[0432]    According to another approach, "knob-into-hole" or "KnH" technology refers to a technology that directs the pairing of two polypeptides together in vitro or in vivo by introducing a pertuberance (knob) into one polypeptide and a cavity (hole) into the other polypeptide at an interface in which they interact. For example, KnHs have been introduced in the Fc:Fc binding interfaces, CL:CH1 interfaces or VH/VL interfaces of antibodies (e.g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US20007/0178552</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 96/027011</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 98/050431</bibl> and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Zhu et al. (1997) Protein Science 6:781-788</bibl>). This is especially useful in driving the pairing of two different heavy chains together during the manufacture of multispecific antibodies. For example, multispecific antibodies having KnH in their Fc regions can further comprise single variable domains linked to each Fc region, or further comprise different heavy chain variable domains that pair with similar or different light chain variable domains. According to one embodiment, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory "cavities" of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.</p><p>[0433]    Multispecific antibodies include cross-linked or "heteroconjugate" antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980</bibl>), and for treatment of HIV infection (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 91/00360</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 92/00373</bibl>, and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">EP 03089</bibl>). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking method. Suitable cross-linking agents and techniques are known (e.g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980</bibl>).</p><p>[0434]    Techniques for generating multispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Brennan et al., Science, 229: 81 (1985)</bibl> describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab')2 fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab' fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab'-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab'-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab'-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.</p><p>[0435]    Fab'-SH fragments can be recovered from E. coli and can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Shalaby et al., J. Exp. Med., 175: 217-225 (1992)</bibl> describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab')2 molecule. Each Fab' fragment was separately secreted from E. coli and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.</p><p>[0436]    Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kostelny et al., J. Immunol., 148(5):1547-1553 (1992)</bibl>. The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab' portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The "diabody" technology described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993)</bibl> has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gruber et al., J. Immunol., 152:5368 (1994)</bibl>.</p><p>[0437]    Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Tutt et al. J. Immunol. 147: 60 (1991)</bibl>.</p><p>Single-Domain Antibodies</p><p>[0438]    In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention is a single-domain antibody. A single-domain antibody is a single polypeptide chain comprising all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain or all or a portion of the light chain variable domain of an antibody. In certain embodiments, a single-domain antibody is a human single-domain antibody (Domantis, Inc., Waltham, Mass.; see, e.g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,516 B1</bibl>). In one embodiment, a single-domain antibody consists of all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain of an antibody.</p><p>Antibody Variants</p><p>[0439]    In some embodiments, amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate changes into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.</p><p>[0440]    A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called "alanine scanning mutagenesis" as described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085</bibl>. Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.</p><p>[0441]    Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.</p><p>[0442]    In certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.</p><p>[0443]    Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites) is created or removed. The alteration may also be made by the addition, deletion, or substitution of one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).</p><p>[0444]    Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched, biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N-linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wright et al. (1997) TIBTECH 15:26-32</bibl>. The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates, e.g., mannose, N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc), galactose, and sialic acid, as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the "stem" of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments, modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.</p><p>[0445]    For example, antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached (directly or indirectly) to an Fc region. Such variants may have improved ADCC function. See, e.g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US Patent Publication Nos.

Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and/or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described, e.g., in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 2003/011878</bibl> (Jean-Mairet et al.); <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat.

Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function.

Such substitutions may occur in combination with any of the variations described above.</p><p>[0448]    In certain embodiments, an anti-VEGF-C antibody variant comprises an Fc region with an amino substitution at position 297.</p><p>[0449]    In certain embodiments, the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments, the Fc activities of the antibody are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc[gamma]R binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc[gamma]RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc[gamma]RI, Fc[gamma]RII and Fc[gamma]RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-92 (1991)</bibl>.

Alternatively, non-radioactive assays methods may be employed (see, for example, ACTI(TM) non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry (CellTechnology, Inc. Mountain View, Calif.; and CytoTox 96(R) non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells.

Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 95:652-656 (1998)</bibl>. C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay may be performed (see, for example, <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol.

Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains (in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A. L.

Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or, into the remaining (non-conserved) sites.</p><p>[0464]    One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have modified (e.g., improved) biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody, which may be conveniently generated using phage display-based affinity maturation techniques. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to at least part of a phage coat protein (e.g., the gene III product of M13) packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. binding affinity). In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, scanning mutagenesis (e.g., alanine scanning) can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to techniques known in the art, including those elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening using techniques known in the art, including those described herein, and variants with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.</p><p>[0465]    Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.</p><p>[0466]    It may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of antibodies of the invention, thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.</p><p>[0467]    In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art, it is contemplated that in some embodiments, an antibody of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody, e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart.

These modifications comprise introduction of a protuberance into a first Fc polypeptide and a cavity into a second Fc polypeptide, wherein the protuberance is positionable in the cavity so as to promote complexing of the first and second Fc polypeptides.

In particular embodiments, the substituted residues occur at accessible sites of the antibody. By substituting those residues with cysteine, reactive thiol groups are thereby positioned at accessible sites of the antibody and may be used to conjugate the antibody to other moieties, such as drug moieties or linker-drug moieties, as described further herein. In certain embodiments, any one or more of the following residues may be substituted with cysteine: V205 (Kabat numbering) of the light chain; A118 (EU numbering) of the heavy chain; and S400 (EU numbering) of the heavy chain Fc region.</p><p>Antibody Derivatives</p><p>[0470]    The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available.

Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer are attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc.</p><p>[0471]    In another embodiment, conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided.

Another anti-tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane.

A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies.

When the conjugate is used for detection, it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies, for example tc99m or I123, or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging (also known as magnetic resonance imaging, mri), such as iodine-123 again, iodine-131, indium-111, fluorine-19, carbon-13, nitrogen-15, oxygen-17, gadolinium, manganese or iron.</p><p>[0493]    The radio- or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways.

See pages 467-498, 2003-2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.</p><p>Preparation of Antibody Drug Conjugates</p><p>[0496]    In the antibody drug conjugates (ADC), an antibody (Ab) is conjugated to one or more drug moieties (D), e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody, through a linker (L). The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent, to form Ab-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a drug moiety D; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent, to form D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Additional methods for preparing ADC are described herein.</p><p>[0000]    
Ab-(L-D)p  I</p><p>[0497]    The linker may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl ("MC"), maleimidopropanoyl ("MP"), valine-citrulline ("val-cit"), alanine-phenylalanine ("ala-phe"), p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl ("PAB"), N-Succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate ("SPP"), N-Succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 carboxylate ("SMCC"), and N-Succinimidyl(4-iodo-acetyl)aminobenzoate ("SIAB"). Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein. See also "Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands", <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Ser. No. 10/983,340</bibl>, filed Nov. 5, 2004, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p>[0498]    In some embodiments, the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include: valine-citrulline (vc or val-cit), alanine-phenylalanine (af or ala-phe). Exemplary tripeptides include: glycine-valine-citrulline (gly-val-cit) and glycine-glycine-glycine (gly-gly-gly). Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citrulline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes, for example, a tumor-associated protease, cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease.</p><p>[0499]    Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by introducing one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues).</p><p>[0500]    Antibody drug conjugates may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Geoghegan &amp; Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,852</bibl>). Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.</p><p>[0501]    Likewise, nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.</p><p>[0502]    Alternatively, a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.</p><p>[0503]    In yet another embodiment, the antibody may be conjugated to a "receptor" (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a "ligand" (e.g., avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).</p><p>Certain Methods of Making Antibodies</p><p>Certain Hybridoma-Based Methods</p><p>[0504]    Monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using the hybridoma method first described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975)</bibl>, and further described, e.g., in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hongo et al., Hybridoma, 14 (3): 253-260 (1995)</bibl>, <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)</bibl>, and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ni, Xiandai Mianyixue, 26(4):265-268 (2006)</bibl> regarding human-human hybridomas.

Nos. 7,078,492 and 7,153,507</bibl>. An exemplary protocol for producing monoclonal antibodies using the hybridoma method is described as follows. In one embodiment, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Antibodies are raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of a polypeptide comprising VEGF-C or a fragment thereof, and an adjuvant, such as monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)/trehalose dicrynomycolate (TDM) (Ribi Immunochem. Research, Inc., Hamilton, Mont.). A polypeptide comprising VEGF-C or a fragment thereof may be prepared using methods well known in the art, such as recombinant methods, some of which are further described herein. Serum from immunized animals is assayed for anti-VEGF-C antibodies, and booster immunizations are optionally administered. Lymphocytes from animals producing anti-VEGF-C antibodies are isolated. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.</p><p>[0506]    Lymphocytes are then fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell. See, e.g., <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)</bibl>. Myeloma cells may be used that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Exemplary myeloma cells include, but are not limited to, murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)</bibl>).</p><p>[0507]    The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium, e.g., a medium that contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells. Preferably, serum-free hybridoma cell culture methods are used to reduce use of animal-derived serum such as fetal bovine serum, as described, for example, in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Even et al., Trends in Biotechnology, 24(3), 105-108 (2006)</bibl>.</p><p>[0508]    Oligopeptides as tools for improving productivity of hybridoma cell cultures are described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Franek, Trends in Monoclonal Antibody Research, 111-122 (2005)</bibl>. Specifically, standard culture media are enriched with certain amino acids (alanine, serine, asparagine, proline), or with protein hydrolyzate fractions, and apoptosis may be significantly suppressed by synthetic oligopeptides, constituted of three to six amino acid residues. The peptides are present at millimolar or higher concentrations.</p><p>[0509]    Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing may be assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies that bind to VEGF-C. The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells may be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can be determined, for example, by Scatchard analysis. See, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Munson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980)</bibl>.</p><p>[0510]    After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. See, e.g., Goding, supra. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. Monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography. One procedure for isolation of proteins from hybridoma cells is described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 2005/176122</bibl> and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 6,919,436</bibl>. The method includes using minimal salts, such as lyotropic salts, in the binding process and preferably also using small amounts of organic solvents in the elution process.</p><p>Certain Library Screening Methods</p><p>[0511]    Antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are described generally in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hoogenboom et al. in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., 2001</bibl>). For example, one method of generating antibodies of interest is through the use of a phage antibody library as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lee et al., J. Mol. Biol. (2004), 340(5):1073-93</bibl>.</p><p>[0512]    In principle, synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region (Fv) fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non-binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen, and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption/elution. Any of the antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region (Fc) sequences described in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication 91-3242, Bethesda Md. (1991), vols. 1-3</bibl>.</p><p>[0513]    In certain embodiments, the antigen-binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable (V) regions of about 110 amino acids, one each from the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains, that both present three hypervariable loops (HVRs) or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments, in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short, flexible peptide, or as Fab fragments, in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non-covalently, as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Winter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994)</bibl>. As used herein, scFv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as "Fv phage clones" or "Fv clones."</p><p>[0514]    Repertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be searched for antigen-binding clones as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Winter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994)</bibl>. Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Griffiths et al., EMBO J, 12: 725-734 (1993)</bibl>. Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992)</bibl>.</p><p>[0515]    In certain embodiments, filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments, in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer, e.g. as described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991)</bibl>, or as Fab fragments, in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab-coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins, e.g. as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hoogenboom et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 19: 4133-4137 (1991)</bibl>.</p><p>[0516]    In general, nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti-VEGF-C clones is desired, the subject is immunized with VEGF-C to generate an antibody response, and spleen cells and/or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment, a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti-VEGF-C clones is obtained by generating an anti-VEGF-C antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array (and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system) such that VEGF-C immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against VEGF-C. The generation of human antibody-producing transgenic mice is described below.</p><p>[0517]    Additional enrichment for anti-VEGF-C reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing VEGF-C-specific membrane bound antibody, e.g., by cell separation using VEGF-C affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome-labeled VEGF-C followed by flow-activated cell sorting (FACS).</p><p>[0518]    Alternatively, the use of spleen cells and/or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire, and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal (human or non-human) species in which VEGF-C is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction, stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species, such as human, mouse, rat, lagomorpha, luprine, canine, feline, porcine, bovine, equine, and avian species, etc.</p><p>[0519]    Nucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments (including VH and VL segments) are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries, the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers matching the 5' and 3' ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Orlandi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 3833-3837 (1989)</bibl>, thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA, with back primers at the 5' end of the exon encoding the mature V-domain and forward primers based within the J-segment as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Orlandi et al. (1989)</bibl> and in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ward et al., Nature, 341: 544-546 (1989)</bibl>.

Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 5728-5732 (1989)</bibl>. To maximize complementarity, degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Orlandi et al. (1989)</bibl> or <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sastry et al. (1989)</bibl>. In certain embodiments, library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V-gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample, e.g. as described in the method of <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991)</bibl> or as described in the method of <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Orum et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 21: 4491-4498 (1993)</bibl>. For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors, rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Orlandi et al. (1989)</bibl>, or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991)</bibl>.</p><p>[0520]    Repertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH-gene segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Tomlinson et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227: 776-798 (1992)</bibl>), and mapped (reported in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Matsuda et al., Nature Genet., 3: 88-94 (1993)</bibl>; these cloned segments (including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop) can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992)</bibl>. VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Barbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 4457-4461 (1992)</bibl>. Human V[kappa] and V[lambda] segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Williams and Winter, Eur. J. Immunol., 23: 1456-1461 (1993)</bibl>) and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires, based on a range of VH and VL folds, and L3 and H3 lengths, will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V-gene encoding DNAs, germline V-gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992)</bibl>.</p><p>[0521]    Repertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors, and the vectors recombined in vitro, e.g., as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hogrefe et al., Gene, 128: 119-126 (1993)</bibl>, or in vivo by combinatorial infection, e.g., the loxP system described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Waterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 21: 2265-2266 (1993)</bibl>. The in vivo recombination approach exploits the two-chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by E. coli transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately, one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid-containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present (about 10&lt;12 &gt;clones). Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co-packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity (Kd&lt;-1 &gt;of about 10&lt;-8 &gt;M).</p><p>[0522]    Alternatively, the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector, e.g. as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Barbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991)</bibl>, or assembled together by PCR and then cloned, e.g. as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991)</bibl>. PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv (scFv) repertoires. In yet another technique, "in cell PCR assembly" is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Embleton et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 20: 3831-3837 (1992)</bibl>.</p><p>[0523]    The antibodies produced by naive libraries (either natural or synthetic) can be of moderate affinity (Kd&lt;-1 &gt;of about 10&lt;6 &gt;to 10&lt;7 &gt;M&lt;-1&gt;), but affinity maturation can also be mimicked in vitro by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Winter et al. (1994)</bibl>, supra. For example, mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error-prone polymerase (reported in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Leung et al., Technique, 1: 11-15 (1989)</bibl>) in the method of <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hawkins et al., J. Mol. Biol., 226: 889-896 (1992)</bibl> or in the method of <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gram et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 3576-3580 (1992)</bibl>. Additionally, affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs, e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest, in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 9607754</bibl> (published 14 Mar. 1996) described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Marks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992)</bibl>. This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities of about 10&lt;-9 &gt;M or less.</p><p>[0524]    Screening of the libraries can be accomplished by various techniques known in the art. For example, VEGF-C can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates, expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting, or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin-coated beads, or used in any other method for panning phage display libraries.</p><p>[0525]    The phage library samples are contacted with immobilized VEGF-C under conditions suitable for binding at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally, the conditions, including pH, ionic strength, temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid, e.g. as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Barbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991)</bibl>, or by alkali, e.g. as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991)</bibl>, or by VEGF-C antigen competition, e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991)</bibl>. Phages can be enriched 20-1,000-fold in a single round of selection. Moreover, the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.</p><p>[0526]    The efficiency of selection depends on many factors, including the kinetics of dissociation during washing, and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics (and weak binding affinities) can be retained by use of short washes, multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions, but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics (and good binding affinities) can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bass et al., Proteins, 8: 309-314 (1990)</bibl> and in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 92/09690</bibl>, and a low coating density of antigen as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Marks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992)</bibl>.</p><p>[0527]    It is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities, even with affinities that differ slightly, for VEGF-C. However, random mutation of a selected antibody (e.g. as performed in some affinity maturation techniques) is likely to give rise to many mutants, most binding to antigen, and a few with higher affinity. With limiting VEGF-C, rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all higher affinity mutants, phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated VEGF-C, but with the biotinylated VEGF-C at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for VEGF-C. The high affinity-binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Such "equilibrium capture" allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding, with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two-fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.</p><p>[0528]    Anti-VEGF-C clones may be selected based on activity. In certain embodiments, the invention provides anti-VEGF-C antibodies that bind to living cells that naturally express VEGF-C. In one embodiment, the invention provides anti-VEGF-C antibodies that block the binding between a VEGF-C ligand and VEGF-C, but do not block the binding between a VEGF-C ligand and a second protein. Fv clones corresponding to such anti-VEGF-C antibodies can be selected by (1) isolating anti-VEGF-C clones from a phage library as described above, and optionally amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable bacterial host; (2) selecting VEGF-C and a second protein against which blocking and non-blocking activity, respectively, is desired; (3) adsorbing the anti-VEGF-C phage clones to immobilized VEGF-C; (4) using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones that recognize VEGF-C-binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding determinants of the second protein; and (5) eluting the clones which remain adsorbed following step (4). Optionally, clones with the desired blocking/non-blocking properties can be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.</p><p>[0529]    DNA encoding hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template). Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody-encoding DNA include <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Skerra et al., Curr. Opinion in Immunol., 5: 256 (1993)</bibl> and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Pluckthun, Immunol. Revs, 130: 151 (1992)</bibl>.</p><p>[0530]    DNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and/or light chain constant regions (e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat et al., supra) to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and/or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. An Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal (such as human) species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence(s) for "hybrid," full length heavy chain and/or light chain is included in the definition of "chimeric" and "hybrid" antibody as used herein. In certain embodiments, an Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence(s) for full- or partial-length human heavy and/or light chains.</p><p>[0531]    DNA encoding anti-VEGF-C antibody derived from a hybridoma of the invention can also be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived from the hybridoma clone (e.g. as in the method of <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81: 6851-6855 (1984)</bibl>). DNA encoding a hybridoma- or Fv clone-derived antibody or fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this manner, "chimeric" or "hybrid" antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the Fv clone or hybridoma clone-derived antibodies of the invention.</p><p>Vectors, Host Cells, and Recombinant Methods</p><p>[0532]    Antibodies may also be produced using recombinant methods. For recombinant production of an anti-VEGF-C antibody, nucleic acid encoding the antibody is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.</p><p>Signal Sequence Component</p><p>[0533]    An antibody of the invention may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process a native antibody signal sequence, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, lpp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, a factor leader (including Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces [alpha]-factor leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the C. albicans glucoamylase leader, or the signal described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 90/13646</bibl>. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available.</p><p>Origin of Replication</p><p>[0534]    Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2[mu] plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).</p><p>Selection Gene Component</p><p>[0535]    Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli.</p><p>[0536]    One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.</p><p>[0537]    Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up antibody-encoding nucleic acid, such as DHFR, glutamine synthetase (GS), thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.</p><p>[0538]    For example, cells transformed with the DHFR gene are identified by culturing the transformants in a culture medium containing methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. Under these conditions, the DHFR gene is amplified along with any other co-transformed nucleic acid. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in endogenous DHFR activity (e.g., ATCC CRL-9096) may be used.</p><p>[0539]    Alternatively, cells transformed with the GS gene are identified by culturing the transformants in a culture medium containing L-methionine sulfoximine (Msx), an inhibitor of GS. Under these conditions, the GS gene is amplified along with any other co-transformed nucleic acid. The GS selection/amplification system may be used in combination with the DHFR selection/amplification system described above.</p><p>[0540]    Alternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody of interest, wild-type DHFR gene, and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199</bibl>.</p><p>[0541]    A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Stinchcomb et al., Nature, 282:39 (1979)</bibl>). The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Jones, Genetics, 85:12 (1977)</bibl>. The presence of the trp1 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2-deficient yeast strains (ATCC 20,622 or 38,626) are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.</p><p>[0542]    In addition, vectors derived from the 1.6 [mu]m circular plasmid pKD1 can be used for transformation of Kluyveromyces yeasts. Alternatively, an expression system for large-scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">K. lactis. Van den Berg, Bio/Technology, 8:135 (1990)</bibl>. Stable multi-copy expression vectors for secretion of mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of Kluyveromyces have also been disclosed. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Fleer et al., Bio/Technology, 9:968-975 (1991)</bibl>.</p><p>Promoter Component</p><p>[0543]    Expression and cloning vectors generally contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to nucleic acid encoding an antibody. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter, [beta]-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase promoter, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However, other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding an antibody.</p><p>[0544]    Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3' end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3' end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.</p><p>[0545]    Examples of suitable promoter sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.</p><p>[0546]    Other yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">EP 73,657</bibl>. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.</p><p>[0547]    Antibody transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells can be controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), or from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.</p><p>[0548]    The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446</bibl>. A modification of this system is described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978</bibl>. See also <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Reyes et al., Nature 297:598-601 (1982)</bibl> on expression of human [beta]-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.</p><p>Enhancer Element Component</p><p>[0549]    Transcription of a DNA encoding an antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, [alpha]-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Yaniv, Nature 297:17-18 (1982)</bibl> on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the antibody-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5' from the promoter.</p><p>Transcription Termination Component</p><p>[0550]    Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO94/11026</bibl> and the expression vector disclosed therein.</p><p>Selection and Transformation of Host Cells</p><p>[0551]    Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are the prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia, e.g., E. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, e.g., Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia, e.g., Serratia marcescans, and Shigella, as well as Bacilli such as B. subtilis and B. licheniformis (e.g., B. licheniformis 41P disclosed in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">DD 266,710</bibl> published 12 Apr. 1989), Pseudomonas such as P. aeruginosa, and Streptomyces. One preferred E. coli cloning host is E. coli 294 (ATCC 31,446), although other strains such as E. coli B, E. coli X1776 (ATCC 31,537), and E. coli W3110 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.</p><p>[0552]    Full length antibody, antibody fusion proteins, and antibody fragments can be produced in bacteria, in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed, such as when the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a toxin) that by itself shows effectiveness in tumor cell destruction. Full length antibodies have greater half life in circulation. Production in E. coli is faster and more cost efficient. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria, see, e.g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat.

After expression, the antibody may be isolated from the E. coli cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be purified through, e.g., a protein A or G column depending on the isotype. Final purification can be carried out similar to the process for purifying antibody expressed e.g, in CHO cells.</p><p>[0553]    In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding vectors.

Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ham et al., Meth.

Re. No. 30,985</bibl> may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN(TM) drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.</p><p>Purification of Antibody</p><p>[0560]    When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, are removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)</bibl> describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of E. coli. Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.</p><p>[0561]    The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being among one of the typically preferred purification steps. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human [gamma]1, [gamma]2, or [gamma]4 heavy chains (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lindmark et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13 (1983)</bibl>). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human [gamma]3 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Guss et al., EMBO J. 5:15671575 (1986)</bibl>). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX(TM) resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE(TM) chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.</p><p>[0562]    Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).</p><p>[0563]    In general, various methodologies for preparing antibodies for use in research, testing, and clinical are well-established in the art, consistent with the above-described methodologies and/or as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art for a particular antibody of interest.</p><p>Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosages</p><p>[0564]    The antibody composition will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include, but not limited to, the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention (when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.</p><p>[0565]    Pharmaceutical formulations herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.</p><p>[0566]    The "therapeutically effective amount" of the antibody to be administered will be governed by considerations discussed above, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat a disease or disorder. The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages. Generally, alleviation or treatment of a disease or disorder involves the lessening of one or more symptoms or medical problems associated with the disease or disorder. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug can accomplish one or a combination of the following: reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., to decrease to some extent and/or stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. In some embodiments, a composition of this invention can be used to prevent the onset or reoccurrence of the disease or disorder in a subject or mammal.</p><p>[0567]    In certain embodiments, depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 [mu]g/kg to 50 mg/kg (e.g., 0.1-20 mg/kg) of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. In another embodiment, about 1 [mu]g/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg) of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 [mu]g/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs.</p><p>[0568]    One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 15 mg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, 6.0 mg/kg, 7.0 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg, 8.0 mg/kg, 9.0 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, e.g. every day, every three days, every week or every two to three weeks (e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, or e.g. about six doses of the antibody). In one embodiment, dose of about 10 mg/kg is administered every three days. An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. In one embodiment, an exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg/kg of the antibody. However, other dosage regimens may be useful.</p><p>[0569]    In certain embodiments, dosing regimens discussed herein are used in combination with anti-VEGF antibody and/or a chemotherapy regimen as the first line therapy for treating metastatic colorectal cancer. In some aspects, the chemotherapy regimen involves the traditional high-dose intermittent administration. In some other aspects, the chemotherapeutic agents are administered using smaller and more frequent doses without scheduled breaks ("metronomic chemotherapy").</p><p>[0570]    The progress of the therapy of the invention is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.</p><p>[0571]    An antibody of the invention (and any additional therapeutic agent or adjuvant) can be administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Dosing can be by any suitable route, e.g. by injections, such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.</p><p>[0572]    The location of the binding target of an antibody of the invention may be taken into consideration in preparation and administration of the antibody. When the binding target of an antibody is located in the brain, certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody to traverse the blood-brain barrier. Several art-known approaches exist for transporting molecules across the blood-brain barrier, including, but not limited to, physical methods, lipid-based methods, stem cell-based methods, and receptor and channel-based methods.</p><p>[0573]    Physical methods of transporting an antibody across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, circumventing the blood-brain barrier entirely, or by creating openings in the blood-brain barrier. Circumvention methods include, but are not limited to, direct injection into the brain (see, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Papanastassiou et al., Gene Therapy 9: 398-406 (2002)</bibl>), interstitial infusion/convection-enhanced delivery (see, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bobo et al., Proc.

Methods of creating openings in the barrier include, but are not limited to, ultrasound (see, e.g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0038086</bibl>), osmotic pressure (e.g., by administration of hypertonic mannitol (<bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Neuwelt, E.

No. 5,004,697</bibl>).</p><p>[0577]    Pharmaceutical formulations comprising an antibody of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (<bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th edition (2000)</bibl>), in the form of aqueous solutions, lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, histidine and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN(TM), PLURONICS(TM) or polyethylene glycol (PEG).</p><p>[0578]    The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th edition (2000)</bibl>.</p><p>[0579]    The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.</p><p>[0580]    Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the immunoglobulin of the invention, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919</bibl>), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and [gamma] ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT(TM) (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated immunoglobulins remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37[deg.] C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S-S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.</p><p>Methods</p><p>[0581]    The invention further provides methods, kits and articles of manufacture for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) processes involved in lympthangiogenesis and angiogenesis and for use in targeting pathological conditions associated with lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis, such as cancer.</p><p>[0582]    Anti-angiogenic therapy in relationship to cancer is a cancer treatment strategy aimed at inhibiting the development of tumor blood vessels required for providing nutrients to support tumor growth. Because angiogenesis is involved in both primary tumor growth and metastasis, the antiangiogenic treatment provided by the invention is capable of inhibiting the neoplastic growth of tumor at the primary site as well as preventing metastasis of tumors at the secondary sites, therefore allowing attack of the tumors by other therapeutics.</p><p>[0583]    Accordingly, the invention encompasses methods for inhibiting angiogenesis using an effective amount of a VEGF-C antagonist (such as an anti-VEGF-C antibody or a VEGF-C immunoadhesin) to inhibit VEGF-C activation of VEGF-C receptors (such as VEGFR3 and VEGFR2). In another aspect, the invention provides methods for inhibiting lymphangiogenesis comprising administering an effective amount of a VEGF-C antagonist to a subject in need of such treatment. In some embodiments, the VEGF-C antagonist is capable of inhibiting LEC endothelial cell migration, proliferation and/or inhibiting LEC sprouting. In another embodiment, the invention provides methods for inhibiting LEC endothelial cell proliferation and/or inhibiting LEC endothelial cell migration comprising administering an effective amount of a VEGF-C antagonist and a VEGF-A antagonist to a subject in need of such treatment. In one embodiment, the VEGF-C antagonist is anti-VEGF-C antibody and the VEGF-A antagonist is anti-VEGF-A antibody. In yet another embodiment, the anti-VEGF-A antibody is bevacizumab.</p><p>Therapeutic Methods</p><p>[0584]    An antibody of the invention may be used in, for example, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo therapeutic methods.</p><p>[0585]    In one aspect, the invention provides methods for treating or preventing a tumor, a cancer, and/or a cell proliferative disorder (e.g., disorder associated with increased expression and/or activity of VEGF-C) comprising administering an effective amount of an anti-VEGF-C antibody to a subject in need of such treatment.</p><p>[0586]    In one aspect, the invention provides methods for reducing, inhibiting, blocking, or preventing growth of a tumor or cancer, the methods comprising administering an effective amount of an anti-VEGF-C antibody to a subject in need of such treatment.</p><p>[0587]    In one aspect, the invention provides methods for inhibiting angiogenesis comprising administering an effective amount of an anti-VEGF-C antibody to a subject in need of such treatment.</p><p>[0588]    In one aspect, the invention provides methods for treating a pathological condition associated with angiogenesis comprising administering an effective amount of an anti-VEGF-C antibody to a subject in need of such treatment. In some embodiments, the pathological condition associated with angiogenesis is a tumor, a cancer, and/or a cell proliferative disorder.</p><p>[0589]    An antibody of the invention can be administered to a human for therapeutic purposes. In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention is used in a method for binding VEGF-C in an individual suffering from a disorder associated with increased VEGF-C expression and/or activity, the method comprising administering to the individual the antibody such that VEGF-C in the individual is bound. In one embodiment, the VEGF-C is human VEGF-C, and the individual is a human individual. Alternatively, the individual can be a mammal expressing VEGF-C to which an antibody of the invention binds. Still further the individual can be a mammal into which VEGF-C has been introduced (e.g., by administration of VEGF-C or by expression of a transgene encoding VEGF-C).</p><p>[0590]    In one aspect, at least some of the antibodies of the invention can bind VEGF-C from species other than human. Accordingly, the antibodies of the invention can be used to bind specific antigen activity, e.g., in a cell culture containing the antigen, in human subjects or in other mammalian subjects having the antigen with which an antibody of the invention cross-reacts (e.g., chimpanzee, baboon, marmoset, cynomolgus and rhesus, pig or mouse). In one embodiment, the antibody of the invention can be used for inhibiting antigen activities by contacting the antibody with the antigen such that antigen activity is inhibited. Preferably, the antigen is a human protein molecule.</p><p>[0591]    Moreover, an antibody of the invention can be administered to a non-human mammal expressing VEGF-C with which the antibody cross-reacts (e.g., a primate, pig, rat, or mouse) for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter, such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of the invention (e.g., testing of dosages and time courses of administration).</p><p>[0592]    The antibodies of the invention can be used to treat, inhibit, delay progression of, prevent/delay recurrence of, ameliorate, or prevent diseases, disorders or conditions associated with expression and/or activity of one or more antigen molecules.</p><p>[0593]    The present invention also encompasses the prevention and treatment of tumoral lymphangiogenesis, the prevention and treatment of tumor metastasis and anti-angiogenic cancer therapy, a novel cancer treatment strategy aimed at inhibiting the development of tumor blood vessels required for providing nutrients to support tumor growth.</p><p>[0594]    The invention specifically includes inhibiting the neoplastic growth of tumor at the primary site as well as preventing and/or treating metastasis of tumors at the secondary sites, therefore allowing attack of the tumors by other therapeutics.

In certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprising an antibody conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent(s) is administered to the patient. In some embodiments, the immunoconjugate and/or antigen to which it is bound is/are internalized by the cell, resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the target cell to which it binds. In one embodiment, the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the target cell. In one embodiment, the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with microtubule polymerization. Examples of such cytotoxic agents include any of the chemotherapeutic agents noted herein (such as a maytansinoid, auristatin, dolastatin, or a calicheamicin), a radioactive isotope, or a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease.</p><p>Combination Therapies</p><p>[0598]    Antibodies of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions in a therapy. In certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention may be co-administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent and/or adjuvant For instance, an anti-VEGF-C antibody of the invention may be co-administered with another antibody (e.g., anti-VEGF antibody), chemotherapeutic agent(s) (including cocktails of chemotherapeutic agents), other cytotoxic agent(s), anti-angiogenic agent(s), cytokines, and/or growth inhibitory agent(s).</p><p>[0599]    Where an antibody of the invention inhibits tumor growth, it may be particularly desirable to combine it with one or more other therapeutic agent(s) which also inhibits tumor growth, e.g., anti-angiogenic agents and/or chemotherapeutic agents. Typically, the anti-VEGF-C antibodies and anti-cancer agents are suitable for the same or similar diseases to block or reduce a pathological disorder such as a tumor, a cancer or a cell proliferative disorder. In one embodiment, anti-VEGF-C antibodies may be used in combinations with anti-cancer therapeutics or anti-neovascularization therapeutics to treat various neoplastic or non-neoplastic conditions.

In one embodiment, one or more additional therapeutic agents, e.g., anti-cancer agents, can be administered in combination with VEGF-C antagonist, the VEGF antagonist, and an anti-angiogenic agent.</p><p>[0605]    In certain aspects of the invention, other therapeutic agents useful for combination tumor therapy with an anti-VEGF-C antibody include other cancer therapies, e.g., surgery and radiological treatments (e.g. external beam irradiation or therapy with a radioactive labeled agent, such as an antibody. In one embodiment, the patient may receive an antibody of the invention combined with radiation therapy.</p><p>[0606]    The administration of the VEGF-C antagonist and the other therapeutic agent (e.g., anti-cancer agent, anti-angiogenic agent) can be done simultaneously, e.g., as a single composition or as two or more distinct compositions using the same or different administration routes. Alternatively, or additionally, the administration can be done sequentially, in any order. For example, the anti-cancer agent may be administered first, followed by the VEGF-C antagonist. Alternatively, or additionally, the steps can be performed as a combination of both sequentially and simultaneously, in any order. In certain embodiments, intervals ranging from minutes to days, to weeks to months, can be present between the administrations of the two or more compositions.</p><p>[0607]    The effective amounts of therapeutic agents administered in combination with a VEGF-C antagonist will be at the physician's or veterinarian's discretion. Dosage administration and adjustment is done to achieve maximal management of the conditions to be treated. The dose will additionally depend on such factors as the type of therapeutic agent to be used and the specific patient being treated. Suitable dosages for the anti-cancer agent are those presently used and can be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the anti-cancer agent and the VEGF-C antagonist. In certain embodiments, the combination of the inhibitors potentiates the efficacy of a single inhibitor. The term "potentiate" refers to an improvement in the efficacy of a therapeutic agent at its common or approved dose. See also the section entitled Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosages herein.</p><p>Chemotherapeutic Agents</p><p>[0608]    In one aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a disorder (such as a tumor, a cancer, or a cell proliferative disorder) by administering effective amounts of an antagonist of VEGF-C and/or an angiogenesis inhibitor(s) and one or more chemotherapeutic agents. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents may be used in the combined treatment methods of the invention. An exemplary and non-limiting list of chemotherapeutic agents contemplated is provided herein under "Definitions." The administration of the VEGF-C antagonist and the chemotherapeutic agent can be done simultaneously, e.g., as a single composition or as two or more distinct compositions, using the same or different administration routes. Alternatively, or additionally, the administration can be done sequentially, in any order. Alternatively, or additionally, the steps can be performed as a combination of both sequentially and simultaneously, in any order. In certain embodiments, intervals ranging from minutes to days, to weeks to months, can be present between the administrations of the two or more compositions. For example, the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered first, followed by the VEGF-C antagonist. However, simultaneous administration or administration of the VEGF-C antagonist first is also contemplated. Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides methods comprising administration of a VEGF-C antagonist (such as an anti-VEGF-C antibody), followed by administration of a chemotherapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, intervals ranging from minutes to days, to weeks to months, can be present between the administrations of the two or more compositions.</p><p>[0609]    As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the appropriate doses of chemotherapeutic agents will be generally around those already employed in clinical therapies wherein the chemotherapeutics are administered alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics. Variation in dosage will likely occur depending on the condition being treated. The physician administering treatment will be able to determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject.</p><p>Relapse Tumor Growth</p><p>[0610]    The invention also provides methods and compositions for inhibiting or preventing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth. Relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth is used to describe a condition in which patients undergoing or treated with one or more currently available therapies (e.g., cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, hormonal therapy and/or biological therapy/immunotherapy, anti-VEGF antibody therapy, particularly a standard therapeutic regimen for the particular cancer) is not clinically adequate to treat the patients or the patients are no longer receiving any beneficial effect from the therapy such that these patients need additional effective therapy. As used herein, the phrase can also refer to a condition of the "non-responsive/refractory" patient, e.g., which describe patients who respond to therapy yet suffer from side effects, develop resistance, do not respond to the therapy, do not respond satisfactorily to the therapy, etc. In various embodiments, a cancer is relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth where the number of cancer cells has not been significantly reduced, or has increased, or tumor size has not been significantly reduced, or has increased, or fails any further reduction in size or in number of cancer cells. The determination of whether the cancer cells are relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth can be made either in vivo or in vitro by any method known in the art for assaying the effectiveness of treatment on cancer cells, using the art-accepted meanings of "relapse" or "refractory" or "non-responsive" in such a context. A tumor resistant to anti-VEGF treatment is an example of a relapse tumor growth.</p><p>[0611]    The invention provides methods of blocking or reducing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth in a subject by administering one or more VEGF-C antagonist to block or reduce the relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth in subject. In certain embodiments, the antagonist can be administered subsequent to the cancer therapeutic. In certain embodiments, the VEGF-C antagonists are administered simultaneously with cancer therapy. Alternatively, or additionally, the VEGF-C antagonist therapy alternates with another cancer therapy, which can be performed in any order. The invention also encompasses methods for administering one or more inhibitory antibodies to prevent the onset or recurrence of cancer in patients predisposed to having cancer. Generally, the subject was or is concurrently undergoing cancer therapy. In one embodiment, the cancer therapy is treatment with an anti-angiogenesis agent, e.g., a VEGF antagonist. The anti-angiogenesis agent includes those known in the art and those found under the Definitions herein. In one embodiment, the anti-angiogenesis agent is an anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody or fragment (e.g., humanized A4.6.1, AVASTIN(R) (Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.), Y0317, M4, G6, B20, 2C3, etc.).

In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting a test cell with an anti-VEGF-C antibody; determining the level of expression (either quantitatively or qualitatively) of VEGF-C by the test cell by detecting binding of the anti-VEGF-C antibody to VEGF-C; and comparing the level of expression of VEGF-C by the test cell with the level of expression of VEGF-C by a control cell (e.g., a normal cell of the same tissue origin as the test cell or a cell that expresses VEGF-C at levels comparable to such a normal cell), wherein a higher level of expression of VEGF-C by the test cell as compared to the control cell indicates the presence of a disorder associated with increased expression of VEGF-C. In certain embodiments, the test cell is obtained from an individual suspected of having a disorder associated with increased expression of VEGF-C. In certain embodiments, the disorder is a tumor, cancer, and/or cell proliferative disorder.</p><p>[0613]    Exemplary disorders that may be diagnosed using an antibody of the invention include, but not limited to, list of disorders, tumors and cancers provided herein under "Definitions."</p><p>[0614]    In another aspect, the invention provides a method of detecting the presence of VEGF-C in a biological sample. The term "detecting" as used herein encompasses quantitative or qualitative detection.</p><p>[0615]    In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting the biological sample with an anti-VEGF-C antibody under conditions permissive for binding of the anti-VEGF-C antibody to VEGF, and detecting whether a complex is formed between the anti-VEGF-C antibody and VEGF-C. In some embodiments, the complex is in vivo or in vitro. In some embodiments, the complex comprises a cancer cell.</p><p>[0616]    Analytical methods for VEGF-C all use one or more of the following reagents: labeled VEGF-C analogue, immobilized VEGF-C analogue, labeled anti-VEGF-C antibody, immobilized anti-VEGF-C antibody and/or steric conjugates. The labeled reagents also are known as "tracers."</p><p>[0617]    In certain embodiments, the anti-VEGF-C antibody is detectably labeled. The label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of VEGF-C and anti-VEGF-C antibody. Labels include, but are not limited to, labels or moieties that are detected directly (such as fluorescent, chromophoric, electron-dense, chemiluminescent, and radioactive labels), as well as moieties, such as enzymes or ligands, that are detected indirectly, e.g., through an enzymatic reaction or molecular interaction. Exemplary labels include, but are not limited to, the radioisotopes &lt;32&gt;P, &lt;14&gt;C, &lt;125&gt;I, &lt;3&gt;H, and &lt;131&gt;I, fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, umbelliferone, luceriferases, e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456</bibl>), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase, [beta]-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases, e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase, coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP, lactoperoxidase, or microperoxidase, biotin/avidin, spin labels, bacteriophage labels, stable free radicals, and the like.</p><p>[0618]    Conventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to proteins or polypeptides. For instance, coupling agents such as dialdehydes, carbodiimides, dimaleimides, bis-imidates, bis-diazotized benzidine, and the like may be used to tag the antibodies with the above-described fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and enzyme labels. See, for example, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat.

Preferred labels herein are enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. The conjugation of such label, including the enzymes, to the antibody is a standard manipulative procedure for one of ordinary skill in immunoassay techniques. See, for example, <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">O'Sullivan et al., "Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme-antibody Conjugates for Use in Enzyme Immunoassay," in Methods in Enzymology, ed.

Immobilization may entail separating an anti-VEGF-C antibody from any VEGF-C that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti-VEGF-C antibody before the assay procedure, as by adsorption to a water-insoluble matrix or surface (Bennich et al., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 3,720,760</bibl>), or by covalent coupling (for example, using glutaraldehyde cross-linking), or by insolubilizing the anti-VEGF-C antibody after formation of a complex between the anti-VEGF-C antibody and VEGF-C, e.g., by immunoprecipitation.</p><p>[0620]    Anti-VEGF-C antibodies can be used for the detection of VEGF-C in any one of a number of well known detection assay methods. For example, a biological sample may be assayed for VEGF-C by obtaining the sample from a desired source, admixing the sample with anti-VEGF-C antibody to allow the antibody to form antibody/VEGF-C complex with any VEGF-C present in the mixture, and detecting any antibody/VEGF-C complex present in the mixture. The biological sample may be prepared for assay by methods known in the art which are suitable for the particular sample. The methods of admixing the sample with antibodies and the methods of detecting antibody/VEGF-C complex are chosen according to the type of assay used.</p><p>[0621]    Assays used to detect binding of anti-VEGF-C antibodies to VEGF-C include, but not limited to, antigen-binding assays that are well known in the art, such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), competitive and "sandwich" assays, immunoprecipitation assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and steric inhibition assays.</p><p>[0622]    In one embodiment, the expression of VEGF-C in a sample may be examined using immunohistochemistry and staining protocols. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections has been shown to be a reliable method of assessing or detecting presence of proteins in a sample. Immunohistochemistry techniques utilize an antibody to probe and visualize cellular antigens in situ, generally by chromogenic or fluorescent methods. For sample preparation, a tissue or cell sample from a mammal (typically a human patient) may be used. Examples of samples include, but are not limited to, cancer cells such as colon, breast, prostate, ovary, lung, stomach, pancreas, lymphoma, and leukemia cancer cells. The sample can be obtained by a variety of procedures known in the art including, but not limited to surgical excision, aspiration or biopsy. The tissue may be fresh or frozen. In one embodiment, the sample is fixed and embedded in paraffin or the like. The tissue sample may be fixed (i.e. preserved) by conventional methodology. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the choice of a fixative is determined by the purpose for which the sample is to be histologically stained or otherwise analyzed. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the length of fixation depends upon the size of the tissue sample and the fixative used.</p><p>[0623]    IHC may be performed in combination with additional techniques such as morphological staining and/or fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Two general methods of IHC are available; direct and indirect assays. According to the first assay, binding of antibody to the target antigen (e.g., VEGF-C) is determined directly. This direct assay uses a labeled reagent, such as a fluorescent tag or an enzyme-labeled primary antibody, which can be visualized without further antibody interaction. In a typical indirect assay, unconjugated primary antibody binds to the antigen and then a labeled secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. Where the secondary antibody is conjugated to an enzymatic label, a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate is added to provide visualization of the antigen. Signal amplification occurs because several secondary antibodies may react with different epitopes on the primary antibody. The primary and/or secondary antibody used for immunohistochemistry typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety.</p><p>[0624]    Aside from the sample preparation procedures discussed above, further treatment of the tissue section prior to, during or following IHC may be desired. For example, epitope retrieval methods, such as heating the tissue sample in citrate buffer may be carried out (see, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Leong et al. Appl. Immunohistochem. 4(3):201 (1996)</bibl>).</p><p>[0625]    Following an optional blocking step, the tissue section is exposed to primary antibody for a sufficient period of time and under suitable conditions such that the primary antibody binds to the target protein antigen in the tissue sample. Appropriate conditions for achieving this can be determined by routine experimentation. The extent of binding of antibody to the sample is determined by using any one of the detectable labels discussed above. Preferably, the label is an enzymatic label (e.g. HRPO) which catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate such as 3,3'-diaminobenzidine chromogen. Preferably the enzymatic label is conjugated to antibody which binds specifically to the primary antibody (e.g., the primary antibody is rabbit polyclonal antibody and secondary antibody is goat anti-rabbit antibody).</p><p>[0626]    Specimens thus prepared may be mounted and coverslipped. Slide evaluation is then determined, e.g., using a microscope, and staining intensity criteria, routinely used in the art, may be employed. Staining intensity criteria may be evaluated as follows:</p><p>[0000]

&lt;tb&gt;&lt;sep&gt;</p><p>[0627]    Typically, a staining pattern score of about 2+ or higher in an IHC assay is diagnostic and/or prognostic. In some embodiments, a staining pattern score of about 1+ or higher is diagnostic and/or prognostic. In other embodiments, a staining pattern score of about 3 of higher is diagnostic and/or prognostic. It is understood that when cells and/or tissue from a tumor or colon adenoma are examined using IHC, staining is generally determined or assessed in tumor cell and/or tissue (as opposed to stromal or surrounding tissue that may be present in the sample).</p><p>[0628]    Other assay methods, known as competitive or sandwich assays, are well established and widely used in the commercial diagnostics industry. In one embodiment, to screen for antibodies which bind to a particular epitope on the antigen of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988)</bibl>, can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping, e.g. as described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Champe et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270:1388-1394</bibl>, can be performed to determine whether the antibody binds an epitope of interest. Detailed exemplary methods for mapping an epitope to which an antibody binds are also provided in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Morris (1996) "Epitope Mapping Protocols," in Methods in Molecular Biology vol. 66 (Humana Press, Totowa, N.J.)</bibl>. Two antibodies are said to bind to the same epitope if each blocks binding of the other by 50% or more.</p><p>[0629]    Competitive assays rely on the ability of a tracer VEGF-C analogue to compete with the test sample VEGF-C for a limited number of anti-VEGF-C antibody antigen-binding sites. The anti-VEGF-C antibody generally is insolubilized before or after the competition and then the tracer and VEGF-C bound to the anti-VEGF-C antibody are separated from the unbound tracer and VEGF-C. This separation is accomplished by decanting (where the binding partner was preinsolubilized) or by centrifuging (where the binding partner was precipitated after the competitive reaction). The amount of test sample VEGF-C is inversely proportional to the amount of bound tracer as measured by the amount of marker substance. Dose-response curves with known amounts of VEGF-C are prepared and compared with the test results to quantitatively determine the amount of VEGF-C present in the test sample. These assays are called ELISA systems when enzymes are used as the detectable markers.</p><p>[0630]    Another species of competitive assay, called a "homogeneous" assay, does not require a phase separation. Here, a conjugate of an enzyme with the VEGF-C is prepared and used such that when anti-VEGF-C antibody binds to the VEGF-C the presence of the anti-VEGF-C antibody modifies the enzyme activity. In this case, the VEGF-C or its immunologically active fragments are conjugated with a bifunctional organic bridge to an enzyme such as peroxidase. Conjugates are selected for use with anti-VEGF-C antibody so that binding of the anti-VEGF-C antibody inhibits or potentiates the enzyme activity of the label. This method per se is widely practiced under the name of EMIT.</p><p>[0631]    Steric conjugates are used in steric hindrance methods for homogeneous assay. These conjugates are synthesized by covalently linking a low-molecular-weight hapten to a small VEGF-C fragment so that antibody to hapten is substantially unable to bind the conjugate at the same time as anti-VEGF-C antibody. Under this assay procedure the VEGF-C present in the test sample will bind anti-VEGF-C antibody, thereby allowing anti-hapten to bind the conjugate, resulting in a change in the character of the conjugate hapten, e.g., a change in fluorescence when the hapten is a fluorophore.</p><p>[0632]    Sandwich assays particularly are useful for the determination of VEGF-C or anti-VEGF-C antibodies. In sequential sandwich assays an immobilized anti-VEGF-C antibody is used to adsorb test sample VEGF-C, the test sample is removed as by washing, the bound VEGF-C is used to adsorb a second, labeled anti-VEGF-C antibody and bound material is then separated from residual tracer. The amount of bound tracer is directly proportional to test sample VEGF-C. In "simultaneous" sandwich assays the test sample is not separated before adding the labeled anti-VEGF-C. A sequential sandwich assay using an anti-VEGF-C monoclonal antibody as one antibody and a polyclonal anti-VEGF-C antibody as the other is useful in testing samples for VEGF-C.</p><p>[0633]    The foregoing are merely exemplary detection assays for VEGF-C. Other methods now or hereafter developed that use anti-VEGF-C antibody for the determination of VEGF-C are included within the scope hereof.</p><p>[0634]    It is understood that any of the above embodiments of diagnosis or detection may be carried out using an immunoconjugate of the invention in place of or in addition to an anti-VEGF-C antibody.</p><p>Articles of Manufacture</p><p>[0635]    In another aspect of the invention, an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of the disorders described above is provided.

V. et al. J Mol Biol 340, 1073-93 (2004)</bibl>). In brief, phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries were built on a single human framework by introducing synthetic diversity at solvent-exposed positions within the heavy chain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). To improve library performance, monovalent and bivalent antigen-binding fragment (Fab) libraries were constructed, and explored different CDR-H3 diversities by varying the amino acid composition and CDR length. The library was then expanded by increasing the variability of CDR-H3 length and using tailored codons that mimicked the amino acid composition of natural CDR-H3 sequences. Using these libraries with completely synthetic CDRs displayed on a single scaffold high affinity antibodies were generated. For further details of strategies and methods for generating synthetic antibody libraries with single template, see, e.g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 2005/012359</bibl> published Feb. 10, 2005, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>[0638]    Plate panning with naïve libraries was performed against human VEGF-C matured form (R&amp;D systems) 5 ug/ml immobilized on MaxiSorp(TM) immunoplates. After four rounds of enrichment, clones were randomly picked and specific binders were identified using phage ELISA. For each positive phage clone, variable regions of heavy and light chains were subcloned into pRK expression vectors that were engineered to express full-length IgG chains. Heavy chain and light chain constructs were co-transfected into 293 or CHO cells, and the expressed antibodies were purified from serum-free medium using protein A affinity column. Purified antibodies were tested by ELISA for blocking the interaction between human VEGF-C and human VEGFR3. For affinity maturation, phage libraries with different combination of CDR loops (CDR-L3 and H3) derived from the initial clone of interest were constructed by soft randomization strategy so that each selected position was mutated to a non-wild type residue or maintained as wild type at about 50:50 frequency (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lee, C. V et al., Blood, 108:3103-3111, 2006</bibl>). High affinity clones were then identified through four rounds of solution phase panning against biotinylated human VEGF-C and then captured by neutravidin coated on the 96-well Maxisorp plate (5 [mu]g/ml). Decreasing biotinylated antigen concentration allowed more stringency in panning</p><p>Example 2</p><p>Anti-VEGF-C Antibodies Binding Affinities, Epitope Mapping and Blocking Analysis</p><p>[0639]    Phage clones were propagated from a single colony by growing in 30 ml of 2YT culture supplemented with carbenicillin and KO7 helper phage overnight at 30[deg.] C., and purified as described (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lee, C V, J Mol Biol 340, 2004</bibl>). Phage were first titrated by diluting in PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween20 (PBT) and tested for binding to hVEGF-C coated plate. The dilution that gave 50%-70% saturation was used to perform the competition binding assay in which phage were first incubated with increasing concentrations of hVEGF-C for 1-2 hour and then transferred to hVEGF-C coated plates to capture the unbound phage. The amount of phage bound was measured with anti-M13 antibody horse-radish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham) and developed with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Md.) as substrate for ~5 min, quenched with 1.0 M H3PO4 and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm wavelength. IC50 values were calculated as the concentration of soluble antigen that inhibited 50% of the phage from binding to immobilized antigen. See also FIGS. 33, 35 and 36.</p><p>[0640]    To determine binding affinities of anti-VEGF-C IgGs, surface plasmon resonance (SRP) measurement with a BIAcore(TM)-3000 instrument was used. First of all, anti-VEGF-C human IgGs were captured by CM5 biosensor chips to achieve approximately 500 response units (RU). For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of human VEGF-C (12.5 nM to 500 nM) were injected separately in PBT buffer (PBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) at 25[deg.] C. with a flow rate of 30 [mu]l/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was calculated as the ratio koff/kon. See also FIGS. 31 and 34.</p><p>[0641]    To evaluate the receptor blocking activities of anti-VEGF-C IgG, three-fold serial dilutions of anti-VEGF-C IgGs were first incubated with optimized biotinylated VEGF-C concentration in PBST buffer for 2 hour, following by captured on VEGFR3 coated Maxisorp plate for 15 minutes. The amount of biotinylated VEGF-C binding to VEGFR3 was detected by streptavidin-HRP conjugates. See also FIGS. 10 and 32.</p><p>[0642]    To map the epitope of anti-VEGF-C antibodies, three-fold serial dilutions of VC4.5 IgG were first incubated with 96-well Maxisorp plate coated hVEGF-C C137S (5 [mu]g/ml) in PBST buffer for 2 hr, following by adding anti-VEGF-C phage with concentration of optimized OD 450 nm signal for 15 minutes. The amount of anti-VEGF-C phage binding to hVEGF-C C137S was detected by anti-M13 HRP conjugates. See also FIG. 37.</p><p>Example 3</p><p>Cell Cultures</p><p>[0643]    HMVEC-dLyAd-Human Dermal Lymphatic Microvascular Endothelial Cells (LECs) and HUVECS were purchased from Cambrex and cultured in EGM-2 medium (Cambrex). C6 LacZ cells were purchased from ATCC. Tumor cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS. All cells were maintained at 37[deg.] C. in a 5% CO2, 95% humidity incubator.</p><p>Cell Migration Assay</p><p>[0644]    VEGF-C has been shown to potently induce migration and proliferation of endothelial cells of lymphatic (LEC's) and venous (HUVEC) origin likely, by binding to and activating VEGFR2 and VEGFR3.</p><p>[0645]    Migration assays were performed using a modified Boyden chamber with 8 [mu]M pore size Falcon 24-multiwell insert system (BD Biosciences). The plates were coated with 5 [mu]g/ml Fibronectin (Invitrogen) for 2 hours at 37[deg.] C. Cells in 100 [mu]l assay medium (0.1% BSA, EGM-2) with/without antibodies were added to the upper chamber. Chemoattractant was added to the lower chamber in 500 [mu]l assay medium, and cells were incubated at 37[deg.] C. for 16 hours. Cells on the upper membrane were removed with a sponge swa.b and cells on the lower surface were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with Sytox green (Molecular Probes). Images were taken of the entire lower surface of the well, and number of migrated cells counted (6 wells per condition). See also FIGS. 7 and 40. Anti-VEGF-C antibody strongly blocked both mature VEGF-C and FL VEGF-C induced migration. The anti-VEGF-C antibody did not have any effect on VEGF or HGF induced migration of HUVECs, confirming its specificity.</p><p>Cell Proliferation Assays</p><p>[0646]    A 96-well black-clear bottom plate (VWR) was coated with 5 ug/ml Fibronectin (Invitrogen) at 37[deg.] C. for 2 hours. LEC's were harvested and resuspended in assay medium (0.1% BSA, EGM-2) 3000 cells/100 ul and added to wells. Cells were incubated at 37[deg.] C. for 16 hours. BrdU labeling solution (Cell Proliferation ELISA kit; Roche) was added and the cells were incubated for a further 24 hours at 37[deg.] C. BrdU incorporation was determined by chemiluminescence immunoassay (6 wells per condition). See also FIGS. 8, 12 and 45. Anti-VEGF-C antibody strongly blocked both mature VEGF-C and full-length VEGF-C induced proliferation. The anti-VEGF-C antibody did not have any effect on VEGF or HGF induced proliferation of HUVECs, confirming its specificity.</p><p>Sprouting Assays</p><p>[0647]    Dextran-coated Cytodex 3 microcarrier beads (Amersham) were incubated with LECs (400 cells per bead) in EGM-2, which contains 200 ng/ml VEGF-C, for 4 hours at 37[deg.] C., inverting every 20 minutes. Beads were then plated overnight at 37[deg.] C. to separate cells not coated on beads. To induce clotting, 0.5 ml cell-coated beads in EGM-2 with 2.5 mg/ml fibrinogen (200 beads/ml)+/-VEGF-C and antibodies was added into one well of a 24-well tissue culture plate containing 0.625 units thrombin and incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then for 20 min at 37[deg.] C. The clot was equilibrated in EGM-2 for 30 min at 37[deg.] C. The medium was then replaced with EGM-2 containing skin fibroblast cells (Detroit 551, 20,000 cells/ml). VEGF-C+/-antibodies were added to each well, and the assay was monitored for 14 days with change in medium every 2-3 days. 10 images of the beads were captured per condition by an inverted microscope. See also FIG. 9.</p><p>Mouse Corneal Micro Pocket Assay</p><p>[0648]    Adult CD-1 mice (Charles-River) were anesthetized and a pocket of 2*3 mm were created 1 mm from the center of the cornea in the epithelium by micro-dissection as described previously (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Polverini et al., Methods Enzymol 198:440-450 (1991)</bibl>). Agents to be tested for lymphangiogenic activity were immobilized in an inert hydron pellet (2*2 mm). The pellet was then implanted into the base of the pocket. Animals were treated with control antibody (10 mg/kg) or anti-VEGF-C (10 mg/kg) i.p. twice weekly for 2 weeks. Then animals were perfused with FITC-labeled Isolectin B4 (Sigma) to identify blood vessels and then perfused with 4% PFA via left ventricular cardiac puncture, sacrificed and corneas dissected. The lymphatics were visualized by whole-mount IHC with anti-LYVE-1 antibody (R&amp;D Systems 1:500). The corneas were photographed and blood vessels (FITC label) and LYVE-1 positive lymphatic vessels arising from the limbus were quantified. See also FIGS. 13 and 14. Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in this model are completely blocked by the systemic administration of anti-VEGF-C antibody, but is unaffected by anti-VEGF antibody.</p><p>VEGF Receptor Signaling Assays</p><p>[0649]    Confluent HUVECs were stimulated for 10 minutes with 200 ng/ml of VEGF-C in the presence or absence of control or anti-VEGF-C antibodies. The cells were lysed and assayed for many mediators know to play a role if VEGF receptor signaling. VEGFR2 activation was evaluated using total VEGFR2 and phospho-VEGFR2 ELISA assays (DuoSet IC ELISA kit, R&amp;D). See also FIG. 11. VEGFR3 activation was evaluated using a kinase receptor activation assay (KIRA) with an VEGFR3-293 cell line as previously described (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sadick et al., 1999</bibl>). See also FIG. 41. Briefly, stable 293 cell lines expressing full length Flag tagged human hVEGFR3 were assayed for receptor phosphorylation following stimulation. 5*10&lt;4 &gt;cells were starved overnight (DMEM with 0.1% BSA) and then stimulated with 40 ng/ml VEGF-A (Genentech South San Francisco, Calif.) or 200 ng/ml VEGF-C (Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, Calif.) for 8 minutes. Cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% triton and sodium orthovanadate. ELISA plates were coated with capture Flag antibody (Sigma St Louis, Mo.). The plates were coated (PBS+1 ug/ml of antibody) overnight and blocked (PBS+0.5% BSA) for 1 hr. After 3 washes (PBS+0.05% Tween 20), lysates were added for 2 hours, washed three times, followed by addition of phospho-detection antibody 4G10 (Upstate Lake Placed, N.Y.) for 2 hours. Detection was performed with HRP antibody (Amersham Piscataway, N.J.) and TMB substrate. Plates were read at 450 nm. Anti-VEGF-C completely inhibited VEGF-C mediated phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and VEGFR3.</p><p>Mouse Skin Vessel Permeability Assay</p><p>[0650]    The backs and flanks of adult C57BL6J female mice were shaved and divided into 4 treatment areas. They were then injected i.v. with 150 [mu]l 0.5% Evan's blue solution. 1 hr after the Evan's blue injection, 20 [mu]l of PBS containing BSA or VEGF-C (7.5 [mu]g/ml) with or without anti-VEGF-C antibody or VEGFR3 ECD (0.5 mg/ml) was injected intradermally, randomly on one of the four zones. 1 hr later, the animals were sacrificed and the skin was dissected out and imaged. Skin samples for each injection zone were cut out and incubated in formamide solution at 55[deg.] C. for 48 hrs to extract the blue dye. The absorbance of the solution was then measured with a spectrometer at 600 nm. Quantification of the Evan's blue dye extracted from skin samples in the permeability assay is shown in FIG. 42. Treatment with anti-VEGF-C antibody and VEGFR3 ECD reduced VEGF-C induced vascular permeability. VEGF induced vascular permeability was not blocked by anti-VEGF-C, confirming specificity.</p><p>Animal Studies</p><p>[0651]    All studies were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the NIH (NIH Publication 85-23, revised 1985). An Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all animal protocols.</p><p>Tumor Models</p><p>[0652]    It has previously been reported that VEGF-C plays a role in primary tumor growth and dissemination of tumor cells by inducing angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Alitalo and Carmeliet, Cancer Cell 1, 219-227 (2002)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Cao et al., PNAS 95, 14389-14394 (1998)</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Skobe et al., Nature Medicine 7, 192-198 (2001b); Su et al., Cancer Cell 9, 209-223 (2006)</bibl>). Since anti-VEGF-C antibody described herein blocked angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in the corneal micro pocket assay, we evaluated its ability to modulate primary tumor growth in 66c14, and H460 tumor models where anti-VEGF has been shown to have an incomplete anti-angiogenic activity.</p><p>[0653]    For 66C14, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed, and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 2*10&lt;5 &gt;cells in 10 [mu]l PBS. Mice were anesthetized using 75 mg/kg ketamine and 7.5 mg/kg xylazine, and an incision made underneath the right forelimb. 2*10&lt;5 &gt;cells in 10 [mu]l PBS was injected directly into the exposed 4&lt;th &gt;mammary fat pad of 6-8 week old female balb-C mice. For C6, 2*10&lt;6 &gt;tumor cells in 100 [mu]l PBS were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of 6-8 week old female balb-C nude mice. For both sets of studies, tumor growth was monitored 3 times weekly. When tumors reach an average size of 80-120 mm&lt;3&gt;, mice were sorted to give nearly identical group mean tumor sizes, and treatment was started. This was considered day 1 of each study. Animals were treated with control antibody (10 mg/kg) or anti-VEGF-C (10 mg/kg) i.p. twice weekly till study termination. All studies were repeated 3 times to ensure reproducibility.

Briefly, xenografts were initiated from cultured H460 human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (grown to mid-log phase in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 [mu]g/mL streptomycin sulfate, 0.25 [mu]g/mL amphotericin B, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 0.075% sodium bicarbonate, and 25 [mu]g/mL gentamicin) or from A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (cultured in Kaighn's modified Ham's F12 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 [mu]g/mL streptomycin sulfate, 0.25 [mu]g/mL amphotericin B, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 25 [mu]g/mL gentamicin). On the day of tumor implant, H460 cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 5*10&lt;7 &gt;cells/mL. Each test mouse received 1*10&lt;7 &gt;H460 tumor cells implanted subcutaneously in the right flank. For A549 tumors, A549 cells were resuspended in 100% Matrigel(TM) matrix (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 5*10&lt;7 &gt;cells/mL. A549 cells (1*10&lt;7 &gt;in 0.2 mL) were implanted subcutaneously in the right flank of each test mouse, and tumor growth was monitored. The animals were sorted by tumor size into four groups (n=10) with group mean tumor volumes of 111-112 mm&lt;3 &gt;and individual tumor sizes ranging from 75 to 196 mm&lt;3 &gt;and this was considered day 1 of study. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: Tumor Volume (mm&lt;3&gt;)=((w&lt;2*l&gt;)/2) where w=width and l=length in mm of a H460 tumor.</p><p>[0655]    All treatments were administered intraperitoneally twice weekly for five weeks (i.p. 2*/wk*5), with anti-VEGF antibody B20-4.1 dosed at 5 mg/kg, and anti-VEGF-C antibody dosed at 10 mg/kg. Group 1 mice received PBS and served as the tumor growth control group. Groups 2 and 3 received monotherapy with anti-VEGF B20-4.1 and anti-VEGF-C antibodies, respectively. Group 4 received anti-VEGF antibody B20-4.1 administered in combination with anti-VEGF-C antibody. For the combination treatment group, anti-VEGF-C antibody was administered no later than thirty minutes after anti-VEGF antibody B20-4.1 dosing. Each dose was delivered in a volume of 0.2 mL per 20 grams body weight (10 mL/kg), and was scaled to the body weight of the animal.</p><p>[0656]    Calculations were performed as follows: percent tumor growth inhibition (% TGI)=(median tumor volume of the control arm-median tumor volume of the treatment arm/median tumor volume of the control arm)*100. % TGI is only measured as long as all animals remain on the study. Time to endpoint (TTE)=log10 (endpoint volume, mm&lt;3&gt;)-b/m; were b is the intercept and m is the slope of the line obtained by linear regression of the log-transformed tumor growth data. Percent tumor growth delay (% TGD)=(median TTE for a treatment arm-median TTE for the control arm/median TTE for the control arm)*100. See also FIGS. 17 and 18.</p><p>[0657]    At study end animals were anesthetized and perfused with 4% PFA. Tumors were harvested, cryoprotected and frozen in OCT (Tissue-Tek). Lungs were inflated via a right ventricular perfusion of 10 ml of PBS followed by 4% PFA, and visual counts of metastatic lesions were performed prior to Micro-CT analysis.</p><p>[0658]    In the 66c14 model, anti-VEGF-C antibody significantly reduced primary tumor growth. See FIGS. 16 and 44. This response translated into an increased survival benefit with anti-VEGF-C treatment. Additionally, anti-VEGF-C antibody also showed efficacy in the H460 model.</p><p>[0659]    The ability of both anti-VEGF antibody and anti-VEGF-C antibody to inhibit tumor growth when utilized as single agents suggested that both VEGF and VEGF-C play important roles in promoting angiogenesis. In the 66c14 model, combination treatment of anti-VEGF-C antibody with anti-VEGF antibody showed an almost complete reduction in primary tumor growth compared to either single agent alone. See FIG. 16. This also resulted in an increased survival benefit. This effect was also seen in the H460 tumor model where combination treatment was more effective at inhibiting primary tumor growth than either treatment alone. See FIG. 17. Primary tumor growth inhibition was reduced significantly in the combination arm over the anti-VEGF antibody treatment arm.</p><p>[0660]    Furthermore, our data suggest that concomitant inhibition of VEGF-C and VEGF provides additional benefit for primary tumor growth stasis. See FIG. 43.</p><p>[0661]    Anti-VEGF-C antibody treatment resulted in a reduction of median tumor growth and increase in survival in A549 tumors in combination with anti-VEGF-A antibody. However, anti-VEGF-C antibody treatment did not result in a reduction of tumor growth as a single agent in this model. We reasoned that this is due to the high VEGF protein levels found in this model, which could mask the effect of blocking VEGF-C. Furthermore, we hypothesized that VEGF-C would become biologically significant in the setting of VEGF inhibition, when the levels of VEGF-C may, to some degree, functionally compensate for the blocked VEGF. To test this we evaluated combination treatment in the A549 model and found that this treatment resulted in a significant decrease in primary tumor growth in the combination arm over the anti-VEGF antibody treatment arm (TGI of 62% compared to anti-VEGF; p=0.007). This improvement is also observed in survival, as shown by the Kaplan-Meier plot with TGD increasing from 65% in the anti-VEGF treated arm to 263% in the combination treated arm. Representative images of H&amp;E stained sections in A549 tumors treated with combination of anti-VEGF-A and anti-VEGF-C further show that anti-VEGF-C antibody and anti-VEGF-A antibody combination treatment results in dramatic histologic changes in the primary tumor mass.</p><p>Micro-CT Analysis of Lungs</p><p>[0662]    Lungs were immersed in 10% NBF for 24 hours, then immersed in a 20% solution of an iodine-based x-ray computed tomography contrast agent, Isovue370 (Bracco Diagnostics Inc, Princeton, N.J.), for 24 hours. Lungs were then immersed in and perfused via the trachea cannula with 20 mls of soy bean oil (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) at a rate of 0.25 ml/min. The soy bean oil was used to remove excess contrast agent and provide a background media for imaging.</p><p>[0663]    The mouse lungs were imaged ex-vivo with a VivaCT (SCANCO Medical, Basserdorf, Switzerland) x-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) system. A sagittal scout image, comparable with a conventional planar x-ray, was obtained to define the start and end point for the axial acquisition of a series of micro-CT image slices. The location and number of axial images were chosen to provide complete coverage of the lung. The lungs were immersed in soybean oil as the background media. The micro-CT images were generated by operating the x-ray tube at an energy level of 45 kV, a current of 160 [mu]A and an integration time of 450 milliseconds. Axial images were obtained at an isotropic resolution of 21 [mu]m. The lung tumor estimates (number and volume) were obtained by a semi-automated image analysis algorithm that includes an inspection step by a trained reader. Lung tumors appear as a hyper-intense solid mass relative to porous, mesh-like structures of the normal lung. This is due to the absorption of the iodine contrast agent by solid structures (bronchial and aveloi walls, tumors, trachea, medial steinum) contained within the lung. Excess contrast agent was cleared from the filled air spaces by the oil perfusion step. Potential tumor masses were extracted by a series of image processing steps. The image analysis software was developed in-house. It was written in C++ and employed the Analyze (AnalyzeDirect Inc., Lenexa, Kans., USA) image analysis software function libraries. The algorithm employs intensity thresholding, morphological filtering and region-growing to extract all potential tumors masses. An intensity threshold (1480 Hounsfield Units) was determined by histogram analysis of 5 arbitrary lungs employed for algorithm development and the optimal threshold was chosen to include tumor voxels and exclude any background signal. Morphological (erosion, dilation) and region-growing operations were applied to connect hyper-intense regions of voxels and to remove any voxels of similar density found in the thin walls of the bronchioles and aveoli. The region growing step requires a minimum volume of 2300 connected voxels (greater than 0.0231 mm&lt;3&gt;) to be accepted as an object (mass). The identified objects were then evaluated by a trained reader with the Analyze 3D visualization software. Individual objects were accepted or rejected as possible tumors based on the appearance of the object and its location within the lung. Objects were rejected if they reside outside the lung (ex. mediasteinum, extraneous tissue debris) or resemble a blood-filled vessel. The tumor count, individual tumor volume and total tumor volume were determined for each lung.

The sections were incubated O/N with primary antibody (anti-LYVE-1 (anti-R&amp;D, 1:200), anti-PECAM-1 (Benton Dickinson, 1:500), MECA32 (Abcam, 1:1000), or Ki67 (Neovision 1:100) at 4[deg.] C. Samples were then stained with Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 secondary antibodies (1:200; Molecular Probes) for 4 hrs at RT. Staining with secondary only was used as a control. TUNNEL staining was performed with a commercial kit (Roche). Images were captured with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Blood and lymphatic vessel area was determined from 6 representative images from each of 6-10 tumors per group, evaluated for mean pixel number by ImageJ Software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij, last visited Jul. 12, 2007) as previously described (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mancuso et al., J Clin Invest (2006); 116(10):2585-7</bibl>.
