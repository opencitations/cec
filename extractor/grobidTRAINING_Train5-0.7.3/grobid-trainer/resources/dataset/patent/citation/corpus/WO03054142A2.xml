NOVEL SULFURYLASE-LUCIFERASE FUSION PROTEINS AND 
THERMOSTABLE SULFURYLASE 
FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
The invention relates generally to fusion proteins that are useful as reporter proteins, in particular to fusion proteins of ATP sulfurylase and luciferase which are utilized to achieve an efficient conversion of pyrophosphate (PPi) to light. This invention also relates to a novel thermostable sulfurylase which can be used in the detection of inorganic pyrophosphate, particularly in the sequencing of nucleic acid. </p><p> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
ATP sulfurylase has been identified as being involved in sulfur metabolism. It catalyzes the initial reaction in the metabolism of inorganic sulfate (So4~2) ; see e. g, <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Robbins and Lipmann, 1958. J. Biol. Chem. 233 : 686-690</bibl> ; <bibl next="bibl80" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hawes and Nicholas, 1973. Biochem. J. 133 : 541-550</bibl>). In this reaction So4~2 is activated to adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS). </p><p>ATP sulfurylase is also commonly used in pyrophosphate sequencing methods. In order to convert pyrophosphate (PPi) generated from the addition of dNMP to a growing DNA chain to light, PPi must first be converted to ATP by ATP sulfurylase. </p><p> ATP produced by an ATP sulfurylase can also be hydrolyzed using enzymatic reactions to generate light. Light-emitting chemical reactions (i. e., chemiluminescence) and biological reactions (i. e., bioluminescence) are widely used in analytical biochemistry for sensitive measurements of various metabolites. In bioluminescent reactions, the chemical reaction that leads to the emission of light is enzyme-catalyzed. For example, the luciferin- luciferase system allows for specific assay of ATP. Thus, both ATP generating enzymes, such as ATP sulfurylase, and light emitting enzymes, such as luciferase, could be useful in a number of different assays for the detection and/or concentration of specific substances in fluids and gases. Since high physical and chemical stability is sometimes required for enzymes involved in sequencing reactions, a thermostable enzyme is desirable. </p><p> Because the product of the sulfurylase reaction is consumed by luciferase, proximity between these two enzymes by covalently linking the two enzymes in the form of a fusion protein would provide for a more efficient use of the substrate. Substrate channeling is a </p> <p> phenomenon in which substrates are efficiently delivered from enzyme to enzyme without equilibration with other pools of the same substrates. In effect, this creates local pools of metabolites at high concentrations relative to those found in other areas of the cell. </p><p>Therefore, a fusion of an ATP generating polypeptide and an ATP converting peptide could benefit from the phenomenon of substrate channeling and would reduce production costs and increase the number of enzymatic reactions that occur during a given time period. </p><p> All patents and publications cited throughout the specification are hereby incorporated by reference into this specification in their entirety in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains. </p><p> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An ORF corresponds to a nucleotide sequence that could potentially be translated into a polypeptide. A stretch of nucleic acids comprising an ORF is uninterrupted by a stop codon. An ORF that represents the coding sequence for a full protein begins with an ATG"start"codon and terminates with one of the three"stop"codons, namely, TAA, TAG, or TGA. For the purposes of this invention, an ORF may be any part of a coding sequence, with or without a start codon, a stop codon, or both. For an ORF to be considered as a good candidate for coding for a bonafìde cellular protein, a minimum size requirement is often set, e. g., a stretch of DNA that would encode a protein of 50 amino acids or more. </p><p> The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequences shown in SEQ ID NO : 1 due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encode the same thermostable sulfurylase proteins as that encoded by the nucleotide sequences shown in SEQ ID NO : 1. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO : 2. In addition to the thermostable sulfurylase nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO : 1 it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that DNA sequence polymorphisms that lead to changes in the amino acid sequences of the thermostable sulfurylase polypeptides may exist within a population (e. g., the bacterial population). Such genetic polymorphism in the thermostable sulfurylase genes may exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. As used herein, the terms"gene"and "recombinant gene"refer to nucleic acid molecules comprising an open reading frame encoding a thermostable sulfurylase protein. Such natural allelic variations can typically result in 1-5% variance in the nucleotide sequence of the thermostable sulfurylase genes. Any and all such nucleotide variations and resulting amino acid polymorphisms in the thermostable sulfurylase polypeptides, which are the result of natural allelic variation and that do not alter the functional activity of the thermostable sulfurylase polypeptides, are intended to be within the scope of the invention. </p><p> Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding thermostable sulfurylase proteins from other species, and thus that have a nucleotide sequence that differs from the sequence SEQ ID </p> <p> NO : 1 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to natural allelic variants and homologues of the thermostable sulfurylase cDNAs of the invention can be isolated based on their homology to the thermostable sulfurylase nucleic acids disclosed herein using the human cDNAs, or a portion thereof, as a hybridization probe according to standard hybridization techniques under stringent hybridization conditions. The invention further includes the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO : 1 and mature and variant forms thereof, wherein a first nucleotide sequence comprising a coding sequence differing by one or more nucleotide sequences from a coding sequence encoding said amino acid sequence, provided that no more than 11% of the nucleotides in the coding sequence differ from the coding sequence. </p><p> Another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding a thermostable sulfurylase protein that contains changes in amino acid residue that are not essential for activity. Such thermostable sulfurylase proteins differ in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO : 2 yet retain biological activity. In separate embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein, wherein the protein comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% homologous to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO : 2. An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a thermostable sulfurylase protein homologous to the protein of SEQ ID NO : 2 can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO : 1 such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. </p><p> Mutations can be introduced into SEQ ID NO : 2 by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted, non-essential amino acid residue. A "conservative amino acid substitution"is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residue having similar side chains have been defined within the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e. g., lysine, arginin, histidine), acidic side chains (e. g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e. g., glycine, asparagine, glutamin, serine, threonin, tyrosine, cystine), nonpolar side chains (e. g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e. g., threonin, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e. g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, </p> <p> histidine). Thus, a predicted non-essential amino acid residue in the thermostable sulfurylase protein is replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. </p><p>Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a thermostable sulfurylase coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for thermostable sulfurylase biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO : 1, the encoded protein can be expressed by any recombinant technology known in the art and the activity of the protein can be determined. </p><p> The relatedness of amino acid families may also be determined based on side chain interactions. Substituted amino acids may be fully conserved"strong"residues or fully conserved"weak"residues. The"strong"group of conserved amino acid residue may be any one of the following groups : STA, NEQK, NHQK, NDEQ, QHRK, MILV, MILF, HY, FYW, wherein the single letter amino acid codes are grouped by those amino acids that may be substituted for each other. Likewise, the"weak"group of conserved residue may be any one of the following : CSA, ATV, SAG, STNK, STPA, SGND, SNDEQK, NDEQHK, NEQHRK, VLIM, HFY, wherein the letters within each group represent the single letter amino acid code. </p><p> The thermostable sulfurylase nucleic acid of the invention includes the nucleic acid whose sequence is provided herein, or fragments thereof. The invention also includes mutant or variant nucleic acids any of whose bases may be changed from the corresponding base shown herein while still encoding a protein that maintains its sulfurylase-like activities and physiological functions, or a fragment of such a nucleic acid. The invention further includes nucleic acids whose sequences are complementary to those just described, including nucleic acid fragments that are complementary to any of the nucleic acids just described. The invention additionally includes nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments, or complements thereto, whose structures include chemical modifications. Such modifications include, by way of nonlimiting example, modified bases, and nucleic acids whose sugar phosphate backbones are modified or derivatized. These modifications are carried out at least in part to enhance the chemical stability of the modified nucleic acid, such that they may be used, for example, as antisense binding nucleic acids in therapeutic applications in a subject. </p><p> A thermostable sulfurylase nucleic acid can encode a mature thermostable sulfurylase polypeptide. As used herein, a"mature"form of a polypeptide or protein disclosed in the </p> <p> present invention is the product of a naturally occurring polypeptide or precursor form or proprotein. The naturally occurring polypeptide, precursor or proprotein includes, by way of nonlimiting example, the full-length gene product, encoded by the corresponding gene. </p><p>Alternatively, it may be defined as the polypeptide, precursor or proprotein encoded by an ORF described herein. The product"mature"form arises, again by way of nonlimiting example, as a result of one or more naturally occurring processing steps as they may take place within the cell, or host cell, in which the gene product arises. Examples of such processing steps leading to a"mature"form of a polypeptide or protein include the cleavage of the N-terminal methionin residue encoded by the initiation codon of an ORF, or the proteolytic cleavage of a signal peptide or leader sequence. Thus a mature form arising from a precursor polypeptide or protein that has residue 1 to N, where residue 1 is the N-terminal methionine, would have residue 2 through N remaining after removal of the N-terminal methionine. Alternatively, a mature form arising from a precursor polypeptide or protein having residue 1 to N, in which an N-terminal signal sequence from residue 1 to residue M is cleaved, would have the residue from residue M+1 to residue N remaining. Further as used herein, a"mature"form of a polypeptide or protein may arise from a step of post-translational modification other than a proteolytic cleavage event. Such additional processes include, by way of non-limiting example, glycosylation, myristoylation or phosphorylation. In general, a mature polypeptide or protein may result from the operation of only one of these processes, or a combination of any of them. </p><p> The term"isolated"nucleic acid molecule, as utilized herein, is one, which is separated f om other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. Preferably, an"isolated"nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i. e., sequences located at the 5'-and 3'-termini of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated thermostable sulfurylase nucleic acid molecules can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0. 5 kb or 0. 1 kb of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell/tissue from which the nucleic acid is derived (e. g., brain, heart, liver, spleen, etc.). Moreover, an "isolated"nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. </p> <p> A nucleic acid molecule of the invention, e. g., a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO : 1 or a complement of this aforementioned nucleotide sequence, can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the sequence information provided herein. Using all or a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO : 1 as a hybridization probe, thermostable sulfurylase molecules can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques (e. g., as described in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sambrook, et al., (eds.), MOLECULAR CLONING : A LABORATORY MANUAL 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989</bibl> ; and <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ausubel, et al., (eds.), CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, NY, 1993</bibl>.) A nucleic acid of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA or alternatively, genomic DNA, as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to thermostable sulfurylase nucleotide sequences can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e. g., using an automated DNA synthesizer. </p><p> As used herein, the term"complementary"refers to Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen base pairing between nucleotides units of a nucleic acid molecule, and the term"binding"means the physical or chemical interaction between two polypeptides or compounds or associated polypeptides or compounds or combinations thereof. Binding includes ionic, non-ionic, van der Waals, hydrophobic interactions, and the like. A physical interaction can be either direct or indirect. Indirect interactions may be through or due to the effects of another polypeptide or compound. Direct binding refers to interactions that do not take place through, or due to, the effect of another polypeptide or compound, but instead are without other substantial chemical intermediates. </p><p> Fragments provided herein are defined as sequences of at least 6 (contiguous) nucleic acids or at least 4 (contiguous) amino acids, a length sufficient to allow for specific hybridization in the case of nucleic acids or for specific recognition of an epitope in the case of amino acids, respectively, and are at most some portion less than a full length sequence. </p><p>Fragments may be derived from any contiguous portion of a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence of choice. Derivatives are nucleic acid sequences or amino acid sequences formed from the native compounds either directly or by modification or partial substitution. Analogs are nucleic acid sequences or amino acid sequences that have a structure similar to, but not </p> <p> identical to, the native compound but differs from it in respect to certain components or side chains. Analogs may be synthetic or from a different evolutionary origin and may have a similar or opposite metabolic activity compared to wild type. Homologs are nucleic acid sequences or amino acid sequences of a particular gene that are derived from different species. </p><p> Derivatives and analogs may be full length or other than full length, if the derivative or analog contains a modified nucleic acid or amino acid, as described below. Derivatives or analogs of the nucleic acids or proteins of the invention include, but are not limited to, molecules comprising regions that are substantially homologous to the nucleic acids or proteins of the invention, in various embodiments, by at least about 89% identity over a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence of identical size or when compared to an aligned sequence in which the alignment is done by a computer homology program known in the art, or whose encoding nucleic acid is capable of hybridizing to the complement of a sequence encoding the aforementioned proteins under stringent, moderately stringent, or low stringent conditions. See e. g. <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ausubel, et al., CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, NY, 1993</bibl>, and below. </p><p> A"homologous nucleic acid sequence"or"homologous amino acid sequence,"or variations thereof, refer to sequences characterized by a homology at the nucleotide level or amino acid level as discussed above. Homologous nucleotide sequences encode those sequences coding for isoforms of thermostable sulfurylase polypeptides. Isoforms can be expressed in different tissues of the same organism as a result of, for example, alternative splicing of RNA. Alternatively, isoforms can be encoded by different genes. In the invention, homologous nucleotide sequences include nucleotide sequences encoding for a thermostable sulfurylase polypeptide of species other than humans, including, but not limited to : vertebrates, and thus can include, e. g., frog, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat cow, horse, and other organisms. Homologous nucleotide sequences also include, but are not limited to, naturally occurring allelic variations and mutations of the nucleotide sequences set forth herein. Homologous nucleic acid sequences include those nucleic acid sequences that encode conservative amino acid substitutions in SEQ ID NO : 1, as well as a polypeptide possessing thermostable sulfurylase biological activity. Various biological activities of the thermostable sulfurylase proteins are described below. </p> <p> The thermostable sulfurylase proteins of the invention include the sulfurylase protein whose sequence is provided herein. The invention also includes mutant or variant proteins any of whose residue may be changed from the corresponding residue shown herein while still encoding a protein that maintains its sulfurylase-like activities and physiological functions, or a functional fragment thereof. The invention further encompasses antibodies and antibody fragments, such as Fab or (Fab) 2, that bind immunospecifically to any of the proteins of the invention. This invention also includes a variant or a mature form of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO : 2, wherein one or more amino acid residue in the variant differs in no more than 4% of the amino acic residue from the amino acid sequence of the mature form. </p><p> Several assays have been developed for detection of the forward ATP sulfurylase reaction. The colorimetric molybdolysis assay is based on phosphate detection (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wilson and Bandurski, 1958. J. Biol. Chem. 233 : 975-981</bibl>), whereas the continuous spectrophotometric molybdolysis assay is based upon the detection of NADH oxidation (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Seubert, et al., 1983. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 225 : 679-691</bibl> ; <bibl next="bibl81" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Seubert, et al., 1985. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 240 : 509-523</bibl>). The later assay requires the presence of several detection enzymes. </p><p> Suitable enzymes for converting ATP into light include luciferases, e. g., insect luciferases. Luciferases produce light as an end-product of catalysis. The best known light- emitting enzyme is that of the firefly, Photinus pyralis (Coleoptera). The corresponding gene has been cloned and expressed in bacteria (see e. g.,<bibl next="bibl82" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> de Wet, et al., 1985. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80 : 7870-7873</bibl>) and plants (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ow, et al., 1986. Science 234 : 856-859</bibl>), as well as in insect (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Jha, et al., 1990. FEBS Lett. 274 : 24-26</bibl>) and mammalian cells (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">de Wet, et al., 1987. Mol. Cell. Biol. 7 : 725-7373</bibl> ; <bibl next="bibl83" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Keller, et al., 1987. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 : 3264-3268</bibl>). In addition, a number of luciferase genes from the Jamaican click beetle, Pyroplorus plagiophilhalamus (Coleoptera), have recently been cloned and partially characterized (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wood, et al., 1989. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 4 : 289-301</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wood, et al., 1989. Science 244 : 700-702)</bibl>. Distinct luciferases can sometimes produce light of different wavelengths, which may enable simultaneous monitoring of light emissions at different wavelengths. Accordingly, these aforementioned characteristics are unique, and add new dimensions with respect to the utilization of current reporter systems. </p> <p> Firefly luciferase catalyzes bioluminescence in the presence of luciferin, adenosine 5'- triphosphate (ATP), magnesium ions, and oxygen, resulting in a quantum yield of 0. 88 (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">McElroy and Selinger, 1960. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 88 : 136-145)</bibl>. The firefly luciferase bioluminescent reaction can be utilized as an assay for the detection of ATP with a detection limit of approximately lx10-l3 M (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Leach, 1981. J. Appl. Biochem. 3 : 473- 517</bibl>). In addition, the overall degree of sensitivity and convenience of the luciferase-mediated detection systems have created considerable interest in the development of firefly luciferase- based biosensors (see e. g.,<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> Green and Kricka, 1984. Talanta 31 : 173-176</bibl> ; <bibl next="bibl84" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Blum, et al., 1989. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 4 : 543-550</bibl>). </p><p> The development of new reagents have made it possible to obtain stable light emission proportional to the concentrations of ATP (see e. g., <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lundin, 1982. Applications of firefly luciferase In ; Luminescent Assays (Raven Press, New York</bibl>). With such stable light emission reagents, it is possible to make endpoint assays and to calibrate each individual assay by addition of a known amount of ATP. In addition, a stable light-emitting system also allows continuous monitoring of ATP-converting systems. </p><p> In a preferred embodiment, the ATP generating-ATP converting fusion protein is attached to an affinity tag. The term"affinity tag"is used herein to denote a peptide segment that can be attached to a polypeptide to provide for purification or detection of the polypeptide or provide sites for attachment of the polypeptide to a substrate. In principal, any peptide or protein for which an antibody or other specific binding agent is available can be used as an affinity tag. Affinity tags include a poly-histidine tract or a biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain, protein A (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nilsson et al., EMBO J. 4 : 1075, 1985</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nilsson et al., Methods Enzymol. 198 : 3, 1991</bibl>), glutathione S transferase (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Smith and Johnson, Gene 67 : 31, 1988</bibl>), substance P, Flag. . peptide (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hopp et al., Biotechnology 6 : 1204-1210, 1988</bibl> ; available from Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, Conn.), streptavidin binding peptide, or other antigenic epitope or binding domain. See, in general <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ford et al., Protein Expression and Purification 2 : 95-107, 1991</bibl>. DNAs encoding affinity tags are available from commercial suppliers (e. g., Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N. J.). </p><p> As used herein, the term"poly-histidine tag,"when used in reference to a fusion protein refers to the presence of two to ten histidine residue at either the amino-or carboy- terminus of a protein of interest. A poly-histidine tract of six to ten residue is preferred. The poly-histidine tract is also defined functionally as being a number of consecutive histidine </p> <p> residue added to the protein of interest which allows the affinity purification of the resulting fusion protein on a nickel-chelate or IDA column. </p><p> In some embodiments, the fusion protein has an orientation such that the sulfurylase polypeptide is N-terminal to the luciferase polypeptide. In other embodiments, the luciferase polypeptide is N-terminal to the sulfurylase polypeptide. As used herein, the term sulfurylase-luciferase fusion protein refers to either of these orientations. The terms"amino- terminal" (N-terminal) and''carboxyl-terminal'' (C-terminal) are used herein to denote positions within polypeptides and proteins. Where the context allows, these terms are used with reference to a particular sequence or portion of a polypeptide or protein to denote proximity or relative position. For example, a certain sequence positioned carboxyl-terminal to a reference sequence within a protein is located proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the reference sequence, but is not necessarily at the carboxyl terminus of the complete protein. </p><p> The fusion protein of this invention can be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques. For example, DNA fragments coding for the different polypeptide sequences are ligated together in-frame in accordance with conventional techniques, e. g., by employing blunt-ended or"sticky"-ended termini for ligation, restriction enzyme digestion to provide for appropriate termini, filling-in of cohesive ends as appropriate, alkaline phosphatase treatment to avoid undesirable joining, and enzymatic ligation. In another embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. </p><p>Alternatively, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers that give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments that can subsequently be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence (see, for example, <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ausubel et al. (eds.) CURRENT PROTOCOLS 1N MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992</bibl>). The two polypeptides of the fusion protein can also be joined by a linker, such as a unique restriction site, which is engineered with specific primers during the cloning procedure. In one embodiment, the sulfurylase and luciferase polypeptides are joined by a linker, for example an ala-ala-ala linker which is encoded by a Notl restriction site. </p><p> In one embodiment, the invention includes a recombinant polynucleotide that comprises a coding sequence for a fusion protein having an ATP generating polypeptide sequence and an ATP converting polypeptide sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the recombinant polynucleotide encodes a sulfurylase-luciferase fusion protein. The term "recombinant DNA molecule"or"recombinant polynucleotide"as used herein refers to a </p> <p> DNA molecule which is comprised of segments of DNA joined together by means of molecular biological techniques. The term"recombinant protein"or"recombinant polypeptide"as used herein refers to a protein molecule which is expressed from a recombinant DNA molecule. </p><p> In one aspect, this invention discloses a sulfurylase-luciferase fusion protein with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and a BCCP tag.

Another aspect of the invention pertains to vectors, preferably expression vectors, containing a nucleic acid encoding an ATP generating polypeptide and an ATP converting </p> <p> polypeptide, or derivatives, fragments, analogs or homologs thereof. As used herein, the term "vector"refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a"plasmid", which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments can be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e. g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e. g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as"expression vectors". In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification,"plasmid"and "vector"can be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e. g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions. </p><p> The recombinant expression vectors of the invention comprise a nucleic acid in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell, which means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulator sequences, selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, that is operatively linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector,"operably linked"is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequence (s) in a manner that allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e. g., in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the host cell). The term"regulatory sequence"is intended to includes promoters, enhances and other expression control elements (e. g., polyadenylation signals). Such regulator sequences are described, for example, in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Goeddel ; GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY : METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990)</bibl>. Regulator sequences include those that direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cell and those that direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e. g., tissue-specific regulator sequences). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the </p> <p> design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, etc. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce a fusion protein. </p><p> The recombinant expression vectors of the invention can be designed for expression of the fusion protein in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, a sulfurylase-luciferase fusion protein can be expressed in bacterial cells such as E. coli, insect cells (using baculovirus expression vectors) yeast cells or mammalian cells. Suitable host cells are discussed further in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Goeddel, GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY : METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990)</bibl>. Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated in vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulator sequences and T7 polymerase. </p><p> Expression of proteins in prokaryotes is most often carried out in E. coli with vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a protein encoded therein, usually to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. Such fusion vectors typically serve three purposes : (1) to increase expression of recombinant protein ; (2) to increase the solubility of the recombinant protein ; and (3) to aid in the purification of the recombinant protein by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. Often, in fusion expression vectors, a proteolytic cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion moiety and the recombinant protein to enable separation of the recombinant protein from the fusion moiety subsequent to purification of the fusion protein. </p><p> In another embodiment, the ATP generating-ATP converting fusion protein expression vector is a yeast expression vector. Examples of vectors for expression in yeast S. cerivisae include pYepSecl (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Baldari, et al., (1987) EMBU J 6 : 229-234)</bibl>, pMFa (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kurjan and Herskowitz, (1982) Cell 30 : 933-943</bibl>), pJRY88 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Schultz et al., (10987) Gene 54 : 113-123</bibl>), pYES2 (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, Calif.), and picZ (InVitrogen Corp, San Diego, Calcif). </p><p> Alternatively, the fusion protein can be expressed in insect cells using baculovirus expression vectors. Baculovirus vectors available for expression of proteins in cultured insect cells (e. g., SF9 cells) include the pAc series (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Smith et al. (1983) Mol Cell Biol 3 : 2156-2165</bibl>) and the pVL series (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lucklow and Summers (1989) Virology 170 : 31-39</bibl>). </p><p> In yet another embodiment, a nucleic acid of the invention is expressed in mammalian cells using a mammalian expression vector. Examples of mammalian expression vectors </p> <p> include pCDM8 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Seed (1987) Nature 329 : 840</bibl>) and pMT2PC (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kaufman et al. (1987) EMBU J 6 : 187-195</bibl>). When used in mammalian cells, the expression vector's control functions are often provided by viral regulator elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus and Simian Virus 40. For other suitable expression systems for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. See, e. g., Chapters 16 and 17 of <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sambrook et al., MOLECULAR CLONING : A LABORATORY MANUAL. 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y., 1989</bibl>. </p><p> In another embodiment, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e. g., tissue-specific regulator elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Tissue-specific regulator elements are known in the art.

Developmentally-regulated promoters are also encompassed, e. g., the murine box promoters (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kessel and Gruss (1990) Science 249 : 374-379</bibl>) and the a-fetoprotein promoter (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Campes and Tilghman (1989) Genes Dev 3 : 537-546</bibl>). </p><p> Another aspect of the invention pertains to host cells into which a recombinant expression vector of the invention has been introduced. The terms"host cell"and "recombinant host cell" are used interchangeably herein. It is understood that such terms refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein. The invention also includes a kit comprising a sulfurylase-luciferase fusion protein expression vector. </p> <p> A host cell can be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. For example, the sulfurylase- luciferase fusion protein can be expressed in bacterial cells such as E. coli, insect cells, yeast or mammalian cells (such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or COS cells). Other suitable host cells are known to those skilled in the art. </p><p> Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. As used herein, the terms"transformation"and "transfection"are intended to refer to a variety of art-recognized techniques for introducing foreign nucleic acid (e. g., DNA) into a host cell, including calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, or electroporation. Suitable methods for transforming or transfecting host cells can be found in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sambrook, et al. (MOLECULAR CLONING : A LABORATORY MANUAL. 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y., 1989)</bibl>, and other laboratory manual. </p><p> For stable transfection of mammalian cells, it is known that, depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used, only a small fraction of cells may integrate the foreign DNA into their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants, a gene that encodes a selectable marker (e. g., resistance to antibiotics) is generally introduced into the host cells along with the gene of interest. Various selectable markers include those that confer resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin and methotrexate. Nucleic acid encoding a selectable marker can be introduced into a host cell on the same vector as that encoding ORFX or can be introduced on a separate vector. Cells stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection (e. g., cells that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive, while the other cells die). </p><p> A host cell of the invention, such as a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell in culture, can be used to produce (i. e., express) the fusion protein. Accordingly, the invention further provides methods for producing the fusion protein using the host cells of the invention. In one embodiment, the method comprises culturing the host cell of invention (into which a recombinant expression vector encoding the fusion protein has been introduced) in a suitable medium such that the fusion protein is produced. In another embodiment, the method further comprises isolating the fusion protein from the medium or the host cell. </p><p> The invention also includes a fusion protein bound to a mobile support. In a preferred embodiment, the fusion gene is a sulfurylase-luciferase fusion gene. In another embodiment, </p> <p> the mobile support is bound to strepavidin. The mobile support could be a bead or optical fiber. In a preferred embodiment, the bead is a nickel-agarose bead or a MPG-Streptavidin bead. In one embodiment, the sulfurylase-luciferase fusion protein is bound to the beads in a 1 : 3 ratio of protein to bead. It can be attached to the solid support via a covalent or non-covalent interaction. In general, any linkage recognized in the art can be used. Examples of such linkages common in the art include any suitable metal (e. g., Co2+, Ni29)-hexahistidine complex, a biotin binding protein, e. g., NEUTRAVIDINTM modified avidin (Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, IL), streptavidin/biotin, avidin/biotin, glutathione S-transferase (GST)/glutathione, monoclonal antibody/antigen, and maltose binding protein/maltose, and pluronic coupling technologies. Samples containing the appropriate tag arc incubated with the sensitized substrate so that zero, one, or multiple molecules attach at each sensitized site. </p><p> Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) catalyzes the first committed step in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. It belongs to a group of carboxylases that use biotin as cofactor and bicarbonate as a source of the carboxyl group. There are two types of ACCase : prokaryotic ACCase (e. g., E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Anabaena, Synechococcus and probably pea chloroplast) in which the three functional domains : biotin carboxylase (BC), biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) and carboxyltransferase (CT) are located on separable subunits and eukaryotic ACCase (e. g., rat, chicken, yeast, diatom and wheat) in which all the domains are located on one large polypeptide. It is known that a BCCP as a subunit of acetyl CoA carboxylase from E. coli is biotinated at the Lys residue at the 122-position by the action of biotin holoenzyme synthetase in E. eoli (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Journal of Biological Chemistry, 263, 6461 (1988)</bibl>). </p><p>In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the fusion protein is bound to a BCCP domain which is then utilized for binding avidins ; therefore, it can bind to a streptavidin mobile support. One biotin- (strept-) avidin-based anchoring method uses a thin layer of a photoactivatable biotin analog dried onto a solid surface. (<bibl next="bibl86" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hengsakul and Cass, 1996. Bioconjugate Chem. 7 : 249-254</bibl>). The biotin analog is then exposed to white light through a mask, so as to create defined areas of activated biotin. Avidin (or streptavidin) is then added and allowed to bind to the activated biotin. The avidin possesses free biotin binding sites which can be utilized to"anchor"the biotinylated proteins through a biotin- (strept-) avidin linkage. </p><p> Alternatively, the fusion protein can be attached to the solid support with a biotin derivative possessing a photo-removable protecting group. This moiety is covalently bound </p> <p> to bovine serum albumin (BSA), which is attached to the solid support, e. g, a glass surface. </p><p>See <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Pirrung and Huang, 1996. Bioconjugate Chem. 7 : 317-321</bibl>. A mask is then used to create activated biotin within the defined irradiated areas. Avidin may then be localized to the irradiated area, with a biotinylated sulfurylase-luciferase fusion protein subsequently attached through a BSA-biotin-avidin-biotin link. </p><p> Another method of attachment is with the use of a pluronics based attachment. </p><p> Pluronics attach to hydrophobic surfaces by virtue of the reaction between the hydrophobic surface and the polypropylene oxide. The remaining polyethylene oxide groups extend off the surface, thereby creating a hydrophilic environment. Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) can be conjugated to the terminal ends of the polyethylene oxide chains to allow for hexahistidine tagged proteins to be attached. </p><p> This invention provides methods of sequencing which utilize and ATP generating polypeptide-ATP converting polypeptide fusion protein for detection. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleotide sequence of the sequencing product is determined by measuring inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) liberated from a nucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) as the dNMP is incorporated into an extended sequence primer. This method of sequencing is termed Pyrosequencing technology (PyroSequencing AB, Stockholm, Sweden). It can be performed in solution (liquid phase) or as a solid phase technique. Various sequencing methods, including PPi sequencing methods, are described in, e. g, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO9813523A1</bibl>, <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ronaghi, et al., 1996. Anal. Biochem. 242 : 84-89</bibl>, and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ronaghi, et al., 1998. Science 281 : 363-365 (1998)</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US patent 6, 274, 320</bibl> and the patent application <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">USSN 10/104, 280</bibl> which was filed on March 21, 2001 (21465-501CIP3). These disclosures of sequencing are incorporated herein in their entirety, by reference. </p><p> Pyrophosphate released under these conditions can be detected enzymatically (e. g., by the generation of light in the luciferase-luciferin reaction). Such methods enable a nucleotide to be identified in a given target position, and the DNA to be sequenced simply and rapidly while avoiding the need for electrophoresis and the use of potentially dangerous radiolabels. </p><p> The invention also provides a method for sequencing nucleic acids which generally comprises (a) providing one or more nucleic acid anchor primers and a plurality of single- stranded circular nucleic acid templates disposed within a plurality of reaction chambers or cavities ; (b) annealing an effective amount of the nucleic acid anchor primer to at least one of the single-stranded circular templates to yield a primed anchor primer-circular template </p> <p> complex ; (c) combining the primed anchor primer-circular template complex with a polymerase to form an extended anchor primer covalently linked to multiple copies of a nucleic acid complementary to the circular nucleic acid template ; (d) annealing an effective amount of a sequencing primer to one or more copies of said covalently linked complementary nucleic acid ; (e) extending the sequencing primer with a polymerase and a predetermined nucleotide triphosphate to yield a sequencing product and, if the predetermined nucleotide triphosphate is incorporated onto the 3'end of said sequencing primer, a sequencing reaction byproduct ; and (f) identifying the PPi sequencing reaction byproduct with the use of an ATP generating polypeptide-ATP converting polypeptide fusion protein, thereby determining the sequence of the nucleic acid. In one embodiment, a dATP or ddATP analogue is used in place of deoxy-or dideoxy adenosine triphosphate. This analogue is capable of acting as a substrate for a polymerase but incapable of acting as a substrate for a PPi-detection enzyme. This method can be carried out in separate parallel common reactions in an aqueous environment. </p><p> In another aspect, the invention includes a method of determining the base sequence of a plurality of nucleotides on an array, which generally comprises (a) providing a plurality of sample DNAs, each disposed within a plurality of cavities on a planar surface ; (b) adding an activated nucleotide 5'-triphosphate precursor of one known nitrogenous base to a reaction mixture in each reaction chamber, each reaction mixture comprising a template-directed nucleotide polymerase and a single-stranded polynucleotide template hybridized to a complementary oligonucleotide primer strand at least one nucleotide residue shorter than the templates to form at least one unaired nucleotide residue in each template at the 3'-end of the primer strand, under reaction conditions which allow incorporation of the activated nucleoside 5'-triphosphate precursor onto the 3'-end of the primer strands, provided the nitrogenous base of the activated nucleoside 5'-triphosphate precursor is complementary to the nitrogenous base of the unaired nucleotide residue of the templates ; (c) utilizing an ATP generating polypeptide-ATP converting polypeptide fusion protein to detect whether or not the nucleoside 5'-triphosphate precursor was incorporated into the primer strands in which incorporation of the nucleoside 5'-triphosphate precursor indicates that the unaired nucleotide residue of the template has a nitrogenous base composition that is complementary to that of the incorporated nucleoside 5'-triphosphate precursor ; and (d) sequentially repeating steps (b) and (c), wherein each sequential repetition adds and, detects the </p> <p> incorporation of one type of activated nucleoside 5'-triphosphate precursor of known nitrogenous base composition ; and (e) determining the base sequence of the unaired nucleotide residue of the template in each reaction chamber from the sequence of incorporation of said nucleoside precursors. </p><p> The anchor primers of the invention generally comprise a stalk region and at least one adaptor region. In a preferred embodiment the anchor primer contains at least two contiguous adapter regions. The stalk region is present at the 5'end of the anchor primer and includes a region of nucleotides for attaching the anchor primer to the solid substrate. </p><p> The adaptor region (s) comprise nucleotide sequences that hybridize to a complementary sequence present in one or more members of a population of nucleic acid sequences. In some embodiments, the anchor primer includes two adjoining adaptor regions, which hybridize to complementary regions ligated to separate ends of a target nucleic acid sequence. In additional embodiments, the adapter regions in the anchor primers are complementary to non-contiguous regions of sequence present in a second nucleic acid sequence. Each adapter region, for example, can be homologous to each terminus of a fragment produced by digestion with one or more restriction endonucleases. The fragment can include, e. g., a sequence known or suspected to contain a sequence polymorphism. </p><p>Additionally, the anchor primer may contain two adapter regions that are homologous to a gapped region of a target nucleic acid sequence, i. e., one that is non-contiguous because of a deletion of one or more nucleotides. When adapter regions having these sequences are used, an aligning oligonucleotide corresponding to the gapped sequence may be annealed to the anchor primer along with a population of template nucleic acid molecules. </p><p> The anchor primer may optionally contain additional elements such as one or more restriction enzyme recognition sites, RNA polymerase binding sites, e. g., a T7 promoter site, or sequences present in identified DNA sequences, e. g., sequences present in known genes. </p><p>The adapter region (s) may also include sequences known to flank sequence polymorphisms. </p><p>Sequence polymorphisms include nucleotide substitutions, insertions, deletions, or other rearrangements which result in a sequence difference between two otherwise identical nucleic acid sequences. An example of a sequence polymorphism is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). </p><p> In general, any nucleic acid capable of base-pairing can be used as an anchor primer. </p><p>In some embodiments, the anchor primer is an oligonucleotide. As utilized herein the term </p> <p> oligonucleotide includes linear oligomers of natural or modified monomers or linkages, e. g., deoxyribonucleosides, ribonucleosides, anomeric forms thereof, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), and the like, that are capable of specifically binding to a target polynucleotide by way of a regular pattern of monomer-to-monomer interactions. These types of interactions can include, e. g., Watson-Crick type of base-pairing, base stacking, Hoogsteen or reverse- Hoogsteen types of base-pairing, or the like. Generally, the monomers are linked by phosphodiester bonds, or analogs thereof, to form oligonucleotides ranging in size from, e. g., 3-200, 8-150, 10-100, 20-80, or 25-50 monomeric units. Whenever an oligonucleotide is represented by a sequence of letters, it is understood that the nucleotides are oriented in the 5' , 3'direction, from left-to-right, and that the letter"A"donates deoxyadenosine, the letter "T"denotes thyrnidine, the letter"C"denotes deoxycytosine, and the letter"G"denotes deoxyguanosine, unless otherwise noted herein. The oligonucleotides of the present invention can include non-natural nucleotide analogs. However, where, for example, processing by enzymes is required, or the like, oligonucleotides comprising naturally occurring nucleotides are generally required for maintenance of biological function. </p><p>* Anchor primers are linked to the solid substrate at the sensitized sites. They can be linked by the same method of linkage as described for the fusion protein to the solid support. </p><p> A region of a solid substrate containing a linked primer is referred to herein as an anchor pad. </p><p> Thus, by specifying the sensitized states on the solid support, it is possible to form an array or matrix of anchor pads. The anchor pads can be, e. g., small diameter spots etched at evenly spaced intervals on the solid support. The anchor pads can be located at the bottoms of the cavitations or wells if the substrate has been cavitated, etched, or otherwise micromachined as discussed above. </p><p> In one embodiment, the anchor primer is linked to a particle. The anchor primer can be linked to the particle prior to formation of the extended anchor primer or after formation of the extended anchor primer. </p><p> Each sensitized site on a solid support is potentially capable of attaching multiple anchor primers. Thus, each anchor pad may include one or more anchor primers. It is preferable to maximize the number of pads that have only a single productive reaction center (e. g., the number of pads that, after the extension reaction, have only a single sequence extended from the anchor primer). This can be accomplished by techniques which include, but are not limited to : (i) varying the dilution of biotinylated anchor primers that are washed </p> <p> over the surface ; (ici) varying the incubation time that the biotinylated primers are in contact with the avidin surface ; (ici) varying the concentration of open-or closed-circular template so that, on average, only one primer on each pad is extended to generate the sequencing template ; or (iv) reducing the size of the anchor pad to approach single-molecule dimensions ( &lt; 1 lem) such that binding of one anchor inhibits or blocks the binding of another anchor (e. g. by photoactivation of a small spot) ; or (v) reducing the size of the anchor pad such that binding of one circular template inhibits or blocks the binding of a second circular template. </p><p> In some embodiments, each individual pad contains just one linked anchor primer. </p><p>Pads having only one anchor primer can be made by performing limiting dilutions of a selected anchor primer on to the solid support such that, on average, only one anchor primer is deposited on each pad. The concentration of anchor primer to be applied to a pad can be calculated utilizing, for example, a Poisson distribution model. </p><p> In order to maximize the number of reaction pads that contain a single anchor primer, a series of dilution experiments are performed in which a range of anchor primer concentrations or circular template concentrations are varied. For highly dilute concentrations of primers, primers and circular templates binding to the same pad will be independent of each other, and a Poisson distribution will characterize the number of anchor primers extended on any one pad. Although there will be variability in the number of primers that are actually extended, a maximum of 37% of the pads will have a single extended anchor primer (the number of pads with a single anchor oligonucleotide). </p><p> In other embodiments multiple anchor primers are attached to any one individual pad in an array. Limiting dilutions of a plurality of circular nucleic acid templates (described in more detail below) may be hybridized to the anchor primers so immobilized such that, on average, only one primer on each pad is hybridized to a nucleic acid template. Library concentrations to be used may be calculated utilizing, for example, limiting dilutions and a Poisson distribution model. </p><p> The nucleic acid templates that can be sequenced according to the invention, e. g., a nucleic acid library, in general can include open circular or closed circular nucleic acid molecules. A"closed circle"is a covalently closed circular nucleic acid molecule, e. g., a circular DNA or RNA molecule. An"open circle"is a linear single-stranded nucleic acid molecule having a 5'phosphate group and a 3'hydroxyl group. In one embodiment, the single stranded nucleic acid contains at least 100 copies of nucleic acid sequence, each copy </p> <p> covalently linked end to end. In some embodiments, the open circle is formed in situ from a linear double-stranded nucleic acid molecule. The ends of a given open circle nucleic acid molecule can be ligated by DNA ligase. Sequences at the 5'and 3'ends of the open circle molecule are complementary to two regions of adjacent nucleotides in a second nucleic acid molecule, e. g., an adapter region of an anchor primer, or to two regions that are nearly adjoining in a second DNA molecule. Thus, the ends of the open-circle molecule can be ligated using DNA ligase, or extended by DNA polymerase in a gap-filling reaction. Open circles are described in detail in Lizard, U. S. Pat. No. 5, 854, 033. An open circle can be converted to a closed circle in the presence of a DNA ligase (for DNA) or RNA ligase following, e. g., annealing of the open circle to an anchor primer. </p><p> If desired, nucleic acid templates can be provided as padlock probes. Padlock probes are linear oligonucleotides that include target-complementary sequences located at each end, and which are separated by a linker sequence. The linkers can be ligated to ends of members of a library of nucleic acid sequences that have been, e. g., physically sheared or digested with restriction endonucleases. Upon hybridization to a target-sequence, the 5'-and 3'-terminal regions of these linear oligonucleotides are brought in juxtaposition. This juxtaposition allows the two probe segments (if properly hybridized) to be covalently-bound by enzymatic ligation (e. g., with T4 DNA ligase), thus converting the probes to circularly-closed molecules which are catenated to the specific target sequences (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nilsson, et al., 1994. Science 265 : 2085-2088</bibl>). The resulting probes are suitable for the simultaneous analysis of many gene sequences both due to their specificity and selectivity for gene sequence variants (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lizard, et al., 1998. Nat Genet. 19 : 225-232</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nilsson, et al., 1997. Nat. Genet. 16 : 252- 255</bibl>) and due to the fact that the resulting reaction products remain localized to the specific target sequences. Moreover, intramolecular ligation of many different probes is expected to be less susceptible to non-specific cross-reactivity than multiplex PCR-based methodologies where non-cognate pairs of primers can give rise to irrelevant amplification products (see e. g.,<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> Landegren and Nilsson, 1997. Ann. Med. 29 : 585-590</bibl>). </p><p> A starting library can be constructed comprising either single-stranded or double- stranded nucleic acid molecules, provided that the nucleic acid sequence includes a region that, if present in the library, is available for annealing, or can be made available for annealing, to an anchor primer sequence. For example, when used as a template for rolling </p> <p> circle amplification, a region of a double-stranded template needs to be at least transiently single-stranded in order to act as a template for extension of the anchor primer. </p><p> Library templates can include multiple elements, including, but not limited to, one or more regions that arc complementary to the anchor primer. For example, the template libraries may include a region complementary to a sequencing primer, a control nucleotide region, and an insert sequence comprised of the sequencing template to be subsequently characterized. As is explained in more detail below, the control nucleotide region is used to calibrate the relationship between the amount of byproduct and the number of nucleotides incorporated. As utilized herein the term"complement"refers to nucleotide sequences that are able to hybridize to a specific nucleotide sequence to form a matched duplex. </p><p> In one embodiment, a library template includes : (i) two distinct regions that are complementary to the anchor primer, (ici) one region homologous to the sequencing primer, (ici) one optional control nucleotide region, (iv) an insert sequence of, e. g., 30-500, 50-200, or 60-100 nucleotides, that is to be sequenced. The template can, of course, include two, three, or all four of these features. </p><p> The template nucleic acid can be constructed from any source of nucleic acid, e. g., any cell, tissue, or organism, and can be generated by any art-recognized method. Suitable methods include, e. g., sonication of genomic DNA and digestion with one or more restriction endonucleases (RE) to generate fragments of a desired range of lengths from an initial population of nucleic acid molecules. Preferably, one or more of the restriction enzymes have distinct four-base recognition sequences. Examples of such enzymes include, e. g., Sau3Al, MspI, and TaqI. Preferably, the enzymes are used in conjunction with anchor primers having regions containing recognition sequences for the corresponding restriction enzymes. In some embodiments, one or both of the adapter regions of the anchor primers contain additional sequences adjoining known restriction enzyme recognition sequences, thereby allowing for capture or annealing to the anchor primer of specific restriction fragments of interest to the anchor primer. In other embodiments, the restriction enzyme is used with a type IIS restriction enzyme. </p><p> Alternatively, template libraries can be made by generating a complementary DNA (cDNA) library from RNA, e. g., messenger RNA (mRNA). The cDNA library can, if desired, be further processed with restriction endonucleases to obtain a 3'end characteristic of a specific RNA, internal fragments, or fragments including the 3'end of the isolated RNA. </p> <p> Adapter regions in the anchor primer may be complementary to a sequence of interest that is thought to occur in the template library, e. g., a known or suspected sequence polymorphism within a fragment generated by endonuclease digestion. </p><p> In one embodiment, an indexing oligonucleotide can be attached to members of a template library to allow for subsequent correlation of a template nucleic acid with a population of nucleic acids from which the template nucleic acid is derived. For example, one or more samples of a starting DNA population can be fragmented separately using any of the previously disclosed methods (e. g., restriction digestion, sonication). An indexing oligonucleotide sequence specific for each sample is attached to, e. g., ligated to, the termini of members of the fragmented population. The indexing oligonucleotide can act as a region for circularization, amplification and, optionally, sequencing, which permits it to be used to index, or code, a nucleic acid so as to identify the starting sample from which it is derived. </p><p> Distinct template libraries made with a plurality of distinguishable indexing primers can be mixed together for subsequent reactions. Determining the sequence of the member of the library allows for the identification of a sequence corresponding to the indexing oligonucleotide. Based on this information, the origin of any given fragment can be inferred. </p><p> Libraries of nucleic acids are annealed to anchor primer sequences using recognized techniques (see, e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hatch, et al., 1999. Genet. Anal. Biomol. Engineer. 15 : 35-40</bibl> ; Kool, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Patent No. 5, 714, 320</bibl> and Lizard, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Patent No. 5, 854, 033</bibl>). In general, any procedure for annealing the anchor primers to the template nucleic acid sequences is suitable as long as it results in formation of specific, i. e., perfect or nearly perfect, complementarity between the adapter region or regions in the anchor primer sequence and a sequence present in the template library. </p><p> A number of in vitro nucleic acid amplification techniques may be utilized to extend the anchor primer sequence. The size of the amplified DNA preferably is smaller than the size of the anchor pad and also smaller than the distance between anchor pads. </p><p> The amplification is typically performed in the presence of a polymerase, e. g., a DNA or RNA-directed DNA polymerase, and one, two, three, or four types of nucleotide triphosphates, and, optionally, auxiliary binding proteins. In general, any polymerase capable of extending a primed 3'-OH group can be used a long as it lacks a 3'to 5'exonuclease activity. Suitable polymerases include, e. g., the DNA polymerases from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Thermus acquaticus, Pyrococcus furiosis, Thermococcus litoralis, and </p> <p> Thermus thermophilus, bacteriophage T4 and T7, and the E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment. Suitable RNA-directed DNA polymerases include, e. g., the reverse transcriptase from the Avian Myeloblastosis Virus, the reverse transcriptase from the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus, and the reverse transcriptase from the Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1. </p><p> A number of in vitro nucleic acid amplification techniques have been described. </p><p>These amplification methodologies may be differentiated into those methods : (i) which require temperature cycling-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (see e. g, <bibl next="bibl87" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Saiki, et al., 1995.

RCA is discussed in, e.g., Kool, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Patent No. 5, 714, 320</bibl> and Lizard, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Patent No. 5, 854, 033</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hatch, et al., 1999. Genet. Anal. Biomol. Engineer. 15 : 35-40</bibl>. The result of the RCA is a single DNA strand extended from the 3'terminus of the anchor primer (and thus is linked to the solid support matrix) and including a concatamer containing multiple copies of the circular template annealed to a primer sequence. Typically, 1, 000 to 10, 000 or more copies of circular templates, each having a size of, e.g., approximately 30-500, 50-200, or 60-100 nucleotides size range, can be obtained with RCA. </p><p> In vivo, RCR is utilized in several biological systems. For example, the genome of several bacteriophage are single-stranded, circular DNA. During replication, the circular DNA is initially converted to a duplex form, which is then replicated by the aforementioned rolling-circle replication mechanism. The displaced terminus generates a series of genomic units that can be cleaved and inserted into the phage particles. Additionally, the displaced single-strand of a rolling-circle can be converted to duplex DNA by synthesis of a complementary DNA strand. This synthesis can be used to generate the concatemeric duplex molecules required for the maturation of certain phage DNAs. For example, this provides the principle pathway by which X bacteriophage matures. RCR is also used in vivo to generate </p> <p> amplified rDNA in Xenopus oocytes, and this fact may help explain why the amplified rDNA is comprised of a large number of identical repeating units. In this case, a single genomic repeating unit is converted into a rolling-circle. The displaced terminus is then converted into duplex DNA which is subsequently cleaved from the circle so that the two termini can be ligated together so as to generate the amplified circle of rDNA. </p><p> Through the use of the RCA reaction, a strand may be generated which represents many tandem copies of the complement to the circularized molecule. For example, RCA has recently been utilized to obtain an isothermal cascade amplification reaction of circularized padlock probes in vitro in order to detect single-copy genes in human genomic DNA samples (see <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lizard, et al., 1998. Nat. Genet. 19 : 225-232</bibl>). In addition, RCA has also been utilized to detect single DNA molecules in a solid phase-based assay, although difficulties arose when this technique was applied to in situ hybridization (see <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lizard, et aZ., 1998. Nat. Genet. 19 : 225-232</bibl>). </p><p> If desired, RCA can be performed at elevated temperatures, e. g., at temperatures greater than 37 C, 42 C, 45 C, 50 C, 60 C, or 70 C. In addition, RCA can be performed initially at a lower temperature, e. g., room temperature, and then shifted to an elevated temperature. Elevated temperature RCA is preferably performed with thermostable nucleic acid polymerases and with primers that can anneal stably and with specificity at elevated temperatures. </p><p>RCA can also be performed with non-naturally occurring oligonucleotides, e. g., peptide nucleic acids. Further, RCA can be performed in the presence of auxiliary proteins such as single-stranded binding proteins. </p><p> The development of a method of amplifying short DNA molecules which have been immobilized to a solid support, termed RCA has been recently described in the literature (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hatch, et al., 1999. Genet. Anal. Biomol. Engineer. 15 : 35-40</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Zhang, et al., 1998. Gene 211 : 277-85</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Baner, et al., 1998. Nucl. AcidsRes. 26 : 5073-5078</bibl> ;<bibl next="bibl89" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> Liu, et al., 1995. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118 : 1587-1594</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Fire andXu, 1995. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 : 4641-4645</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nilsson, et al., 1994. Science 265 : 2085-2088</bibl>). RCA targets specific DNA sequences through hybridization and a DNA ligase reaction. The circular product is then subsequently used as a template in a rolling circle replication reaction. </p><p> RCA driven by DNA polymerase can replicate circularized oligonucleotide probes with either linear or geometric kinetics under isothermal conditions. In the presence of two </p> <p> primers (one hybridizing to the + strand, and the other, to the-strand of DNA), a complex pattern of DNA strand displacement ensues which possesses the ability to generate lux109 or more copies of each circle in a short period of time (i. e., less-than 90 minutes), enabling the detection of single-point mutations within the human genome. Using a single primer, RCA generates hundreds of randomly-linked copies of a covalently closed circle in several minutes. </p><p> If solid support matrix-associated, the DNA product remains bound at the site of synthesis, where it may be labeled, condensed, and imaged as a point light source. For example, linear oligonucleotide probes, which can generate RCA signals, have been bound covalently onto a glass surface. The color of the signal generated by these probes indicates the allele status of the target, depending upon the outcome of specific, target-directed ligation events. As RCA permits millions of individual probe molecules to be counted and sorted, it is particularly amenable for the analysis of rare somatic mutations. RCA also shows promise for the detection of padlock probes bound to single-copy genes in cytological preparations. </p><p> In addition, a solid-phase RCA methodology has also been developed to provide an effective method of detecting constituents within a solution. Initially, a recognition step is used to generate a complex h a circular template is bound to a surface. A polymerase enzyme is then used to amplify the bound complex. RCA uses small DNA probes that are amplified to provide an intense signal using detection methods, including the methods described in more detail below. </p><p>Other examples of isothermal amplification systems include, e. g., (i) self-sustaining, sequence replication (see e. g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Guatelli, et al., 1990. proc.

For example, FUS-L/S X F means a primer for the fusion gene, luciferase- sulfurylase Xho Forward and so forth. Primers 1 through 6 are for the L or TL to S fusions and primers 7 through 13 are for the S to L or TL fusions. </p><p> EXAMPLES Example 1 : Cloning Strategy for Obtaining the Bst Sulfurylase Gene 
Gene specific primers, which incorporated restriction site linkers, were designed based on the sequence for a putative ATP sulfurylase from Bacillus stearothermophilus in </p> <p> ERGO, a curated database of genomic DNA made available on the World Wide Web by Integrated Genomics which included the Bacillus stearothermophilus Genome Sequencing Project at the University of Oklahoma (NSF Grant &amp;num;EPS-9550478). The forward primer utilized was 5'-CCC TTC TGC AGC ATG AGC GTA AGC ATC CCG CAT GGC GGC ACA TTG-3' (SEQ ID NO : 7) and the reverse primer used was 5'-CCC GTA AGC TTT TAG CGC GCT GAC GGG GCG ACC GTT TCG CGT TCT TG-3' (SEQ ID NO : 8). The reaction mix for PCR amplification contained 5. 0 uL 10X polymerase buffer (Clontech, Cat. &amp;num;8714), 2. 0 uL 5 M betaine (Sigma, Cat. &amp;num;B0300), 1. 0 uL dNTP mix (10 mM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), 0. 8 uL Advantage 2 polymerase (Clontech, Cat. &amp;num;8714), 0. 2 uL Advantage-HF 2 polymerase (Clontech, Cat. &amp;num;K1914), 10 pmol forward primer, 10 pmol reverse primer, 100 ng (or less) Bst genomic DNA (ATCC, Cat. &amp;num;12980D), and enough distilled water to make total volume of 50 uL. As little as 1 ng Bst genomic DNA was sufficient to yield PCR product. The PCR amplif cation of Bst ATP sulfurylase gene from genomic DNA consisted of an initial step at 96 C for 3 min, then 35 cycles of 96 C for 15 sec, 60 C for 30 sec, 72 C for 6 min, a finishing step at 72 C for 10 min and finally 14 C until removal. The PCR product was cleaned using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN). </p><p> Example 2 : Cloning Strategy for Obtaining the Sulfurylase-Luciferase Fusion Protein 
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless noted otherwise. Racemically pure D-luciferin was ordered from Pierce. The assay buffer for measuring ATP sulfurylase and luciferase activities contained Taq polymerase. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated approach was utilized to link the open reading frames (ORFs) of luciferase and sulfurylase. </p><p>The cloning strategy is outlined in Fig. 1. Briefly, it involved the amplification of luciferase and sulfurylase ORFs by PCR, using primers that contain convenient restriction sites (XhoI and HindIII) to clone the fusion gene into an expression vector, in-frame and, the design of a rare restriction site (Not I) at the junction of the two polypeptides so that other versions of luciferase, such as thermostable luciferase (TL), and sulfurylase can be conveniently swapped to obtain either sulfurlyase-luciferase (S-L) or luciferase-sulfurlyase (L-S) fusion proteins. A Not I site was used to fuse the variable heavy chain of antibodies to luciferase to generate a viable fusion protein. These primers were also designed in such a way that the primers that form part of the junction of the two ORFs contain sufficient overlapping regions of </p> <p> nucleotides. For example, the 5'end of FUS-L/S Not R contains deoxynucleotides in an anti- parallel orientation that encode the N-terminal 10 amino acids of yeast sulfurylase. Thus, a PCR product generated using this primer would anneal to the 5'end of yeast sulfurylase ORF and would generate the fusion protein, L-S. </p><p> The products in boxes were obtained by PCR as elaborated in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. </p><p>3, the PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis. The PCR products were then purified, digested with Xho I and Hind III and subcloned into Xho I/Hind III digested pRSETA-BCCP. pRSETA-BCCP is a derivative of pRSET A (Invitrogen) in which the sequence between NheI and BamHI restriction sites has been replaced by the portion of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) gene from E. coli (GenBank accession &amp;num;M80458) that codes for residue 87-165. The 87-amino acid BCCP domain was obtained by PCR and cloned into the NheI and Bam HI sites of pRSETA to obtain pRSETA-BCCP. The ligated fusion protein and pRSETA-BCCP were transformed into BL21DE3 and TOP10 cells. BL21DE3 cells yielded colonies for L-S and TOPIC cells yielded colonies for TL-S. </p><p>The following list of primers was used to construct the fusion proteins :

The Bst-affinity tagged fusion construct is a derivative of pRSETA in which the NheI- XhoI fragment has been replaced by the BCCP domain and the ATP sulfurylase is inserted after the BCCP domain. </p><p> Briefly, the BstSulf PCR product, as described in Example 1, was double-digested with pstI and HindIII, isolated on a 1% agarose/TAE gel, purified using QIAEXII (QIAGEN) and ligated into the large PstI/HindIII fragment of pRSETA-BCCP using the Quick Ligation Kit from NEB according to manufacturer's instructions. As mentioned in Example 2, pRSETA-BCCP is a derivative of pRSET A (Invitrogen) in which the sequence between NheI and BamHI restriction sites has been replaced by the portion of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) gene from E. coli (GenBank accession &amp;num;M80458) that codes for residue 87- 165. 2 uL ligation reaction was used to transform 50 uL TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen) and plated on LB-Ap plates. Sequencing of plasmid insert from ten clones was used to determine the consensus sequence for the ATP sulfurylase gene from ATCC 12980. </p><p> The plasmid pRSETA-BCCP-BstSulf was transformed into the E. coli expression host BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen) and the induction expression of BstHBSulf was carried out according to the maufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested and stored as frozen pellets. The pellets were lysed using BugBuster plus Benzonase according to manufacturer's instructions and protein was purified on a 20 mL column packed with Cheating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham, Cat. &amp;num;17-0575-02) and charged with nickel (in). Protein was eluted </p> <p> using a 0-500 mM imidazole gradient. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed a single band of the correct size. </p><p>Example 4 : Binding enzymes to beads 
The BCCP domain enables the E. coli to add a single biotin molecule onto a specific lysine residue. Hence these fusion proteins can be bound to solid supports that contain streptavidin. TL-S was successfully cloned into a TA vector. 25 1ll of MPG-Streptavidin (CPG, Inc.) or Nickel-agarose (Qiagen) were taken in a 1. 5 ml tube and placed on a magnet. </p><p>The supernatant was removed and the beads were resuspended in 25 Fg of His6-BCCP- sulfurylase and 75 llg of His6-BCCP-luciferase. To test the fusion protein, 100 pl of dialyzed fusion protein was bound to the 25 l of beads. The beads were allowed to mix at room temperature for Ihr, washed with assay buffer (25mM Tricine (pH 7. 8), 5mM MgAcetate, 1mM DTT, 1mM EDTA, and 1 mg/ml BSA) and assayed for enzyme activities with 1mM PPi, 4mM APS and 300 mM D-luciferin. With the nickel-agarose beads, the EDTA was omitted from the assay buffer. </p><p> As shown in Fig. 4, these fusion proteins displayed activity on both the NTA-Agarose and MPG-SA beads. S : L 1 : 3 represents sulfurylase and luciferase bound individually to beads in a 1 : 3 ratio. Ni-Ag and MPG-SA are nickel-agarose and MPG-Streptavidin beads, respectively. PL is Promega luciferase, which does not have a polyhistidine or a biotin tag on it and hence serves as a negative control. Fraction 19 contains the fusion protein and is active on both kinds of beads. This suggests that the fusion protein was synthesized with a poly- histidine tag and a biotin molecule on the BCCP domain of the fusion protein.</p></description></fulltext-document>
