The alignment process is generally known as acquisition. As shown in Figure 1a, earth orbiting satellite 10 carries a communication terminal 12 which includes a telescope 14 for sending and receiving optical beams 16 and 17. Another earth orbiting satellite 20 carries a communication terminal 22 including a telescope 24 for sending and receiving beams 16 and 17. Beam 17 is aligned with a beam receptor 25. Although the beams 16 and 17 are shown separated in Figure 1, in fact the beams follow a common path through telescopes 14 and 24. The beams are transmitted using complimentary frequencies.

For example, beam 16 is transmitted at 1.554 microns and beam 17 is transmitted at 1.546 microns. Terminals 12 and 22 provide full duplex operation at 6.75 Gbps. Beams 16 and 17 are both diffraction limited. They are not spread or defocused and are modulated to transmit data after acquisition is completed.</p><p num="p0026">Referring to Figure 1b, the present invention allows optical beams used for communication to be aligned with a communication terminal located on an earth-orbiting satellite and with a terminal located on a ground station. Ground station 26 includes a terminal 28 with a telescope 30 which transmits and receives beams 16 and 17 previously described. Each of terminals 12, 22 and 28 is identical. As a result, only one such terminal is described in this specification.</p><p num="p0027">Referring to Figures 2, 3 and 7, a preferred beam acquisition system for terminal 12 made in accordance with the invention basically comprises an optics subassembly (STS) 50, a gimbal positioning subassembly (GS) 150, an electronics control subassembly (AES) 200, a remote electronics assembly 250, and pointing and tracking control loops 300.</p><p num="p0028">Referring to Figure 5, optic subassembly 50 includes telescope 14 (Figure 1) which comprises a protective window 51 and mirrors 53-55 arranged as shown. Telescope 14 is coursely positioned using a means known to those skilled in the art so that it is pointed in the direction of terminal 22 on satellite 20 within a first region of uncertainty. Telescope 14 is a diamond-turned, off-axis, three-mirror anastigmat system made of silicon carbide which can be assembled without alignment. Silicon carbide systems also are advantageous because they inherently have less sensitivity to temperature changes than other types of telescopes. Window 51 has a silicon substrate with a silicon dioxide anti-reflective coating on the exterior surface to protect the interior optical surfaces from particulates, micrometeorites, and ion exposure. Window 51 has a bandpass AR coating which provides attenuation of solar radiation above 1550 nanometers.

Sapphire is also an option for the substrate if warranted by the environmental effects. If sapphire is employed, a silicone substrate bandpass filter is sandwiched with the sapphire window. An especially preferred form of telescope 14 is described in the commonly assigned application entitled, &quot;Optical Inter-Satellite Link (OISL) Gimbal,&quot; <ref type="patent">Application No. 09/346052</ref>, filed on July 7, 1999 in the names of Dan R.

A narrow band pass filter 72 allows passage of the receive beam and discriminates against the transmit beam which uses a different frequency than the receive beam. A track/receive beam splitter 74 diverts about 10% of the beam in receive path 70 to a track sensor path 76. The portion of the beam in path 76 is focused by focusing optics 78 (including one or more lenses or mirrors) on a track sensor 80.</p><p num="p0032">Track sensor 80 defines a field of view 82 located on a photo detector comprising four tracking quadrants TQ1-TQ4. Both the field of view and the tracking quadrants define a common center point 84. The photo detector within track sensor 80 is fabricated from InGaAs. Track sensor 80 is associated with two sets of electronics. The first set causes a detector to respond to optical pulses of a particular temporal nature. In addition, the first set of track sensor electronics processes the sum of all four quadrants in the photodetector as well as each quadrant individually. The second set of electronics generates track error signals in order to keep beams 16 and 17 on track after the acquisition phase is completed.</p><p num="p0033">A particularly preferred form of tracking sensor 80 is described in the commonly assigned application entitled &quot;Inter-Satellite Optical Link Track Sensor,&quot; <ref type="patent">Application No. 09/301494</ref>, filed on April 28, 1999 in the names of Chie Poon, Robert C.

Optics 86 focuses a portion of the receive path beam on an annular mirror 88 which defines a central hole 90. A portion of the beam transmitted through the central hole is focused on a fiber coupler 92 that transmits the portion of the beam to an optical fiber 93. Coupler 92 and fiber 93 serve as a beam receptor for the beam in receive path 70. Fiber coupler 92 and fiber 93 are the eventual recipients of the beam 16 energy directed toward terminal 12 by terminal 22. After acquisition, communication signal information impressed on beam 16 received from terminal 22 is decoded by remote electronics assembly 250.

Point ahead mechanism 110 includes a two axis gimbal assembly 112 which moves a mirror 114 through about plus or minus 2.25 degrees of mechanical travel. Point ahead control signals are transmitted over a cable 113 which is combined with cable 65 to form a cable 115.

This range is extended over that normally required for transmit/receive point ahead during tracking and communication. Point ahead mechanism 110 has the range, bandwidth, resolution, and accuracy required to direct transmit beams 17 over the acquisition sensor field of view 98 in the manner to be described later and corrects for the apparent location of the opposing terminal, (e.g., terminal 22) due to the opposing terminal's velocity and light travel time.

The transmit beam 17 is steered differently from the receive beam 16 line of sight by the point ahead mechanism 110 to compensate for beam travel time to a remote terminal, such as terminal 22 (Figure 1A).

The ring reduces pointing disturbances from satellite 10 (Figure 1A). Isolator 158 consists of six passively damped spring elements arranged in a Stuart Platform configuration which provides the same fundamental frequency in all six degrees of freedom. The isolator spring elements are highly damped using acrylic visco-elastic material. Isolator 158 is designed to have a 10-15 Hz. corner frequency and to provide greater than 10 decibels attenuation of satellite disturbances at 100 Hz.</p><p num="p0046">Positioning subassembly 150 also includes an azimuth cable wrap 160 and a base 162.</p><p num="p0047">Still referring to Figure 6, control subassembly 200 comprises terminal controller electronics 202 which performs computing functions for the control subassembly. For example, electronics 202 provides the command/telemetry interface to the satellite payload processor, performs internal digital processing for control of fine track mechanism 60 and point ahead mechanism 110 during the acquisition process, and implements control for remote electronics assembly 250. The internal processing of electronics 202 include sensor digitization and control for a track loop, unloading loop, a fiber alignment loop, and a point-ahead loop, along with the required module-to-module communication. Electronics 202 also receives power on/off commands and performs power commanding for remote electronics assembly 250.</p><p num="p0048">Control sub-assembly 200 also includes mechanical drive electronics 204 which provides drive and position control functions for fine track mechanism 60 and point ahead mechanism 110.

The various electronics modules of control sub-assembly 200 are connected through a conventional back plane 212.</p><p num="p0052">Referring to Figure 3, remote electronics assembly 250 comprises a master oscillator/modulator (Mo/M) 252 which receives a 6.75 Gbps serial data and clock from the satellite 10 payload on differential lines. After the acquisition phase, Mo/M 252 modulates beam 17 with communication data.

The encoded data modulates the output of a continuous wave master oscillator using a dual-electrode push-pull Mach-Zehnder low-biased to operate as a phase modulator using an active control loop. The distributed feedback master oscillator laser is wave length controlled via active temperature control to within the tracking range of the optical modulator on the receiver end. The deskew, scrambler/differential encoder, and driver amplifier for the modulator are mounted on the front side of the module.</p><p num="p0053">Assembly 250 also comprises a transmit amplifier (TA) 254 which boosts the low-level modulator output to about 300 milliwatts for transmission.</p><p num="p0054">Assembly 250 also includes a low-noise amplifier (LNA) 256 which comprises a low-noise Er fiber amplifier. The signal is filtered before demodulation and detection. Amplifier 256 also includes a tunable filter that closely matches the optical bandwidth to the signal bandwidth. The filter center frequency tracks the optical frequency of the input signal to compensate for Doppler shift or master oscillator wavelength drift.</p><p num="p0055">Assembly 250 also comprises a demodulator bit synchronizer (DBS) 258. After the acquisition phase, communication data in beam 16 is demodulated by the combination of an asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer and a balanced photo detector/ differential transimpedence amplifier. The demodulator splits the optical signal into two paths with a differential delay of 1-bit. The paths are then recombined to form a sum and difference output. When a &quot;zero&quot; bit is transmitted, the phase of the optical carrier is left unchanged from the previous bit by the DPSK modulator.

Optical signals from the two paths add constructively on the sum output and destructively on the difference output, resulting in a positive voltage at the transimpedence amplifier output. When a &quot;one&quot; is transmitted, the phase of the optical carrier changes by 180° relative to the previous bit and the opposite occurs, resulting in a negative voltage at the transimpedence amplifier output.</p><p num="p0056">The bit synchronization recovers a data clock and detects the bits from the low pass filtered analogue wave form. Since the modulation receiver uses a balance detector, no threshold control is necessary. The bits synchronization output is descrambled and output on a serial 6.75 Gbps differential interface along with the recovered clock.</p><p num="p0057">Assembly 250 also comprises a power converter 260 which includes three commercially available converter modules and filters.</p><p num="p0058">Referring to Figure 7, pointing and tracking control loops 300 comprise a track loop 310 including a compensation circuit 312 which provides a signal to a fine tracking mechanism mechanical loop including a compensation circuit 314, a torquer circuit 316 and a sensor 318 connected as shown. The fine tracking mechanism mechanical loop controls the operation of fine tracking mechanism 60 (Figure 4). Track loop 310 tracks the angular position of an opposing terminal (such as terminal 22) (Figure 1A)) to maintain coupling of the received optical energy into receive fiber 93 (Figure 4), the error signal from the tracking sensor 80 measurements is used to adjust the fine track mechanism 60 pointing angle.</p><p num="p0059">Control loops 300 also include an unloading loop 340 (Figure 7) which comprises a compensation circuit 342 that feeds a signal into a gimbal loop which includes a compensation circuit 344, a torquer 346 and a sensor 348 connected as shown. The gimbal loop drives elevation drive 152 and azimuth drive 156 (Figure 6). The unloading loop transfers the fine track mechanism 60 angular position to elevation drive 152 and azimuth drive 156 to keep the fine track mechanism within its mechanical range. That is, center point 57 is aligned with center points 84 and 100 (Figures 9 and 4).</p><p num="p0060">Control loops 300 also comprise a fiber alignment loop 360 (Figure 7) which comprises low noise amplifier 256 (Figure 3) and a compensation circuit 364 which provides a signal to the fine track mechanism mechanical loop previously described. The output of the fine track mechanism alters the relationship of the receive beam to receive fiber coupler 92 as shown in Figure 7. The fiber alignment loop is a low-bandwidth loop to correct alignment errors between fiber receive coupler 92 and track sensor 80. Fine track mechanism 60 applies a small tilt dither in the receive beam; variation in power on target telemetry from the remote electronics assembly low noise amplifier 256 then corrects to the track sensor 80 angular bias.</p><p num="p0061">Control loops 300 also comprise a point ahead loop 370 (Figure 7) which includes a compensation circuit 372 that provides a signal to a point ahead mechanism mechanical loop that includes a compensation circuit 374, a torquer 376 and a sensor 378 connected as shown. The point ahead mechanism mechanical loop controls the operation of point ahead mechanism 110 (Figure 4). The point ahead loop 370 continually corrects for point ahead misalignment. Initial point ahead is based on pointing angles derived from satellite ephemeris. After acquisition, power on target measurements from the opposing terminal (e.g., terminal 22, Figure 1A) communicated across the optical link in optics assembly 50 produce corrections to the position of point ahead mechanism 110. Opposing terminals, (e.g., terminals 12 and 22) dither at different frequencies (nominally 5 and 7 Hz) so that point-ahead error can be distinguished from fiber alignment error.</p><p num="p0062">The apparatus described in Figures 1-7 is operated during the acquisition procedure as illustrated in Figure 8. During an initialization step performed on satellite 10, the approximate position of terminal 22 on satellite 20 is received within an initial uncertainty region. Since satellite 10 knows its approximate current location, it can anticipate the power of beam 16 when it is received from terminal 22.</p><p num="p0063">During step S10, the acquisition logic of terminal 12 in satellite 10 is loaded with information on the location in space of terminal 22 on satellite 20 within an initial uncertainty region RU1 (Figures 14 and 15), the expected power level of beam 16 to be received from terminal 22, and data base parameters defining conditions for transitions between acquisition stages. Once this information is loaded, the acquisition process is commanded to start by external means. No further coordinating messages by external means between terminals 12 and 22 are required.</p><p num="p0064">Each of terminals 12 and 22 directs the center of its acquisition sensor (e.g., center point 100) and track sensor (e.g., center point 84) towards the estimated position of the opposing terminal by its fine track mechanism (e.g., fine track mechanism 60). The fine track mechanisms in terminals 12 and 22 are continually updated to maintain the center points of the fields of view of the respective sensors towards the estimated position of the opposing terminal. Each terminal then uses its point ahead mechanism (e.g., point ahead mechanism 110) to scan out the uncertainty region RU1 with a transmitted beam (e.g., beam 17) using a spiral scan pattern with particular characteristics.</p><p num="p0065">As shown in Figure 16, the.starting point of the scan is at the center of uncertainty region RU1 to optimize the time required for acquiring the opposing terminal, since the opposing terminal is less likely to be located at the extremes of the uncertainty region due to the processes that drive the uncertainty estimates of the opposing terminal. Near the center of the scan, where high acceleration would be required by point ahead mechanism 110 to maintain the equivalent areal scan velocity, the spiral scan transitions to a cycloidal pattern that limits the required acceleration to that realizable by the point ahead mechanism 110 while still maintaining coverage of the uncertainty region. The cycloidal pattern occupies the central 40 microradians of the scan. The size of the pattern is dependent on the acceleration characteristics of the point ahead mechanism.</p><p num="p0066">One example of the cycloid pattern is the rosette pattern 650.</p><p num="p0067">After the area of the uncertainty region near the center of the scan has been covered, the rest of the uncertainty region to outer perimeter OP is covered by a spiral scan 600 (Figures 14 and 16).</p><p num="p0068">The spiral scan sweeps out the uncertainty region at a constant velocity with a distance between the arms of the spiral set to minimize the time to cover the uncertainty region while maintaining probability of adequately covering the complete region in the presence of terminal based motion due to satellite vehicle disturbances. The velocity is chosen to minimize the time required to cover the uncertainty region while generating a pulse of the appropriate power and time interval as described later.</p><p num="p0069">Both the spiral scan 600 and the cycloid pattern 650 are generated based on the bandwidth of the point ahead mechanism 110 to result in optimized coverage of the uncertainty region. At the perimeter of the uncertainty region OP, the outward spiral transitions to a spiral in an inward direction (Figure 14), or the spiral can be restarted from the center with the choice made to minimize the overall acquisition time. Whether the scan is being accomplished with the rosette pattern 650 or with the spiral pattern 600, the velocity of the scan is maintained constant.</p><p num="p0070">Figure 17 illustrates a normalized intensity distribution for a portion of one quadrant of transmitted beam 17. The spiral convolutions, such as 610-612, overlap slightly as shown in Figure 17 so that the entire uncertainty region is covered. When the transmit laser source sweeps by the location of the opposing terminal (e.g., when beam 16 sweeps by terminal 12), the near gaussian shape of beam 16, as well as the constant velocity scan, results in a pulse of optical energy with a characteristic time interval and intensity envelope. The electronics of track sensor 80 and acquisition sensor 96 are highly sensitive to pulses of energy with this characteristic time interval and intensity envelope while being relatively insensitive to signals with other characteristics, such as those signals resulting from solar, planetary, and stellar bodies and body motion and internal optical signals and sensor noise. When a signal with the appropriate characteristics is received, and the signal is above the pre-determined power level threshold, acquisition sensor 96 defines the detector quadrant in which the pulse was detected.</p><p num="p0071">When a pulse from beam 16 transmitted by terminal 22 is detected, the acquisition logic can continue down different paths. The first path involves step S12 shown in Figure 8. Control subassembly 200 includes logic which counts the number of pulses detected by acquisition sensor 96 over time (i.e., the number of times beam 16 enters telescope 14). In step S12, if less than the maximum number of pulses has been detected, the logic moves to step S14 which includes a time allocated for stage expiration. After the time has elapsed, the logic moves onto step S16 which determines whether the minimum number of pulses has been detected and whether the pulses are consistent. If less than a set number of pulses has been detected, the acquisition stage can transition to a previous acquisition stage as indicated by steps S18 and S20, or if in the first acquisition stage, the first stage can be re-tried as indicated in step S22. If the number of first stage re-tries is above a predetermined number, satellite 10 can be notified that the acquisition did not succeed. If more than the minimum number of pulses was detected, but the pulses were not consistent (i.e., the pulses were detected in quadrants on opposing sides of acquisition sensor 96 or in inconsistent quadrants between the acquisition sensor 96 and track sensor 80, indicating that one or more of the pulses was a false detection), the acquisition stage can be re-tried as indicated in step S22. If more than the minimum number of pulses was detected and if the pulses were consistent, the logic can transition to the next acquisition stage as indicated in step S24.</p><p num="p0072">The first acquisition stage is illustrated in Figures 9 and 10. The numbers with an A suffix refer to like numbered parts found in terminal 22. Figure 9 illustrates the field of view 56 of telescope 14 and the field of view 98 of acquisition sensor 96. As shown in Figure 9, fields of view 56 and 98 are substantially the same size. Figure 9 also illustrates a field of view 56A with center point 57A of telescope 24 of terminal 22, and a field of view 98A with center point 100A of the acquisition sensor within terminal 22. An exemplary location of terminal 22 within field of view 56 is indicated by L22. An exemplary location of terminal 12 within field of view 56A is indicated by L12.</p><p num="p0073">As shown in Figure 10, a pulse of receive beam 16 from terminal 22 is detected in quadrant AQ1 of the photo detector of acquisition sensor 96. As a result of this pulse, the position of mirror 64 of fine track mechanism 60 is altered in step S26 (Figure 8) so that center point 100 of field of view 98 of acquisition sensor 96 is pointed toward the region in space represented by quadrant AQ1 in which the location of terminal 22 was detected. In order to illustrate this point, in Figure 11, the re-directed field of view 98' with center point 100' of acquisition sensor 96 is superimposed on the original field of view 56 of telescope 14.</p><p num="p0074">The same mode of operation is illustrated in Figure 14 (in one dimension) which shows the initial region of uncertainty RU1 and the resulting scan of beam 17 by point ahead mechanism 110 in a spiral pattern. The scan pattern defines a spiral locus of scan lines having a center scan line along horizontal axis 0 at the origin of the scan.</p><p num="p0075">The illumination of terminal 12 by beam 16 illustrated in Figure 10 occurs at some time prior to the stage completion, T10 shown in Figure 14. At time T10, the initial region of uncertainty RU1 is reduced to a second region of uncertainty RU2 also illustrated by new scan field of view SC2 (Figures 11 and 12). Point ahead mechanism 110 and fine track mechanism 60 point the center line of the scan into region RU2 as determined by the pulse detected in detector quadrant AQ1. Point ahead mechanism 110 begins to scan transmit beam 17 in region RU2 beginning at center point 100'. As shown in Figure 14, uncertainty region RU2 is smaller than uncertainty region RU1. The scanning of transmit beam 17 in region RU2 is the same as the scanning previously described in region RU1, except that the diameter of the region is smaller.</p><p num="p0076">Referring again to Figure 8, if step S20 results in a decrease in the stage, then in step S28 the field of view 98 for the preceding stage is altered in a manner which reverses the order of Figures 10 and 11.</p><p num="p0077">As shown in Figure 12, telescope 14 is reoriented using unloading loop 340 (Figure 7) so that center point 57 of field of view 56 again is aligned with the new field of view of acquisition sensor 96. That is, center points 57, 84, 91 and 100 are aligned.</p><p num="p0078">To summarize the transition of operation from the initial stage to the next stage, the estimate of the opposing terminal location (e.g., L22, Figures 9-12), the uncertainty region and the scan pattern are adjusted. When a pulse from terminal 22 is detected by terminal 12 on a particular quadrant (e.g., quadrant AQ1), this means that terminal 22 is located within the intersection of uncertainty region RU1 and quadrant AQ1. The new uncertainty region RU2 (Figure 14) is taken to be this intersection. The estimated location of terminal 22 is taken to be the center of the new uncertainty region RU2. The radius of the scan pattern is adjusted to encompass the new uncertainty region RU2, and the center point 100 of the acquisition sensor field of view 98 and then the center point 57 of the telescope field of view 56 are pointed at the center of the new uncertainty region RU2.</p><p num="p0079">Fine track mechanism 60 is used to point center point 100 of the acquisition sensor 96 toward the region of space indicated by the detector quadrant (e.g., quadrant AQ1) in which a pulse is detected. The acquisition logic delays the pointing of the center point of the field of view of the acquisition sensor to account for light travel time between terminals 12 and 22 and to allow fine track mechanism 60 to settle on the new location.</p><p num="p0080">Point ahead mechanism 110 is committed to follow the new scan pattern so that the center point of the spiral scan of beam 17 and center point 100 are aligned. Telescope 14 then follows the movement of point ahead mechanism 110 so that center points 57 and 100 again are aligned. Point ahead mechanism 110 then begins the previously described scan pattern for transmit beam 17.</p><p num="p0081">The result of the transition to the new acquisition stage is that the estimate of the opposing terminal position, (e.g., terminal 22) is improved and the uncertainty region is reduced. Due to the reduced uncertainty region, it takes less time for the scan pattern to be completed resulting in an increasing pulse rate detected by acquisition sensor at the opposing terminal. Thus, each acquisition stage takes less time to complete than the previous acquisition stage.</p><p num="p0082">The number of acquisition stages required is dependent on the size of the initial uncertainty region. After transition through a number of acquisitions stages, the remaining uncertainty and the estimate of the opposing terminal location is less than beam diameter or area. This uncertainty region is sufficient to enable tracking sensor 80 to continuously track beam 16 from terminal 22.</p><p num="p0083">Figure 14 illustrates acquisition stages involving uncertainty regions RU1-RU6 which terminate at times T10-T15, respectively, when a pulse from beam 16 is detected by acquisition sensor 96. Each of uncertainty regions RU1-RU6 is smaller than the previous regions. The transaction from one region to the next can be understood from the description of the transition from region RU1 to RU2. Thus, the size of regions RU1-RU6 successively approaches the size of region TU at which tracking can commence.</p><p num="p0084">The final stages of acquisition, illustrated by uncertainty region FS in Figure 14, drop the spiral scan described previously in favor of a modified cycloid scan pattern like pattern 650 shown in Figure 16. Such patterns are designed to sweep the transmit laser beam across the opposing terminal position a smaller number of times at the edge of the scan pattern 630 as opposed to the central portion of the scan pattern 632. At the opposing terminal, this operation results in a lower pulse rate at the edge of the uncertainty region 630 and a higher pulse rate at the center of the uncertainty region 632.</p><p num="p0085">During the final stages of acquisition, the acquisition logic is modified to move the estimate of the opposing terminal position, and therefore the center point 84 of track sensor 80, a fixed amount in the direction appropriate for the quadrant of track sensor 80 in which the most recent pulse of beam 16 was detected.</p><p num="p0086">Since the effect of a false detection is less critical during the final stages of acquisition, the power level at which the pulses are detected can be adjusted to minimize overall acquisition time. The threshold is adjusted in the circuitry for acquisition sensor 96.</p><p num="p0087">A transition to a previous acquisition stage occurs if less than the predetermined average number of pulses per second are received or if a stage time has been exceeded.

This indicates that the opposing terminal has a larger uncertainty region and therefore needs more time to improve its estimate of the current terminal location. The stage times account for light travel time and are selected to minimize the possibility that the two terminals (e.g., terminals 12 and 22) will cycle back and forth between stages by adding a random time interval to each stage time. If greater than a specific average number of pulses is received, the terminal transitions to the next acquisition stage in a smaller cycloidal pattern that results in a higher detection pulse rate at the opposing terminal.</p><p num="p0088">At the final cycloidal acquisition stage, illustrated by uncertainty region TU in Figure 14, when the average pulse rate exceeds a predetermined threshold, the cycloidal pattern is removed from the commands sent to the point ahead mechanisms (e.g., point ahead mechanism 110) resulting in a constant power beam on the opposing terminal track sensor (e.g., track sensor 80). On the opposing terminal, the second set of track sensor electronics uses this constant power beam to generate track error signals that are used to further correct the opposing terminal tracking. Acquisition is completed when the second set of track electronics on both terminals indicate the reception of sufficient signal power to maintain tracking. If after a predetermined stage time, the second set of track electronics does not indicate sufficient signal power, the acquisition logic drops back to the previous cycloidal acquisition stage for that terminal. The stage times account for light travel time and are selected to minimize the possibility that the two terminals cycle back and forth between stages by adding a random time interval to each stage time.</p><p num="p0089">Referring to Figure 8, the previously described final stages of acquisition are entered through step S32. Since the final stages of acquisition preferably are not timed, the logic proceeds to step S34 in which terminal 12 calculates a real time update and applies it to the estimate for terminal 22. The logic then proceeds to step S36 in which circuitry calculates the average rate at which beam 16 is striking terminal 12. If the strike or hit rate is above a predetermined threshold, step S40 transfers the logic to step S42 which determines whether the hit rate is sufficient to enter the tracking stage at step S44. If the hit rate is insufficient, the logic proceeds to step S46 in which the region of uncertainty stage is increased by 1 and the estimate of the opposing terminal position is modified by a predetermined amount.</p><p num="p0090">Returning to step S40, if the hit rate is not above the go forward threshold, then the logic proceeds to step S48 to determine whether the hit rate is below the go back threshold which requires a decrease in the stage. If the hit rate is below the threshold, then the stage is decreased by 1, and the adjustment of the opposing terminal position estimate is also decreased so that the region of uncertainty is enlarged by a predetermined amount in step S50.</p><p num="p0091">Returning to step S48, if the hit rate is not below the return threshold, then the current stage is continued in step S52.</p><p num="p0092">A comparison of Figures 14 and 15 shows that the number of stages can vary depending on the circumstances, such as the size of the initial region of uncertainty RU1. As shown in Figure 14, there are six progressively smaller regions of uncertainty before terminal 12 enters the final stages of acquisition FS through steps S32 and S34 (Figure 8). When the tracking stage is entered at step S44, the region of uncertainty is the tracking region of uncertainty TU shown in Figures 14 and 15 in which the uncertainty region is less than the diameter or area of the received beam width. Figure 15 illustrates an acquisition in which only three regions of uncertainty (RU1-RU3) are successively entered before the final stage FS is entered.</p><p num="p0093">While terminal 12 is being aligned with beam 16, terminal 22 simultaneously is being aligned with beam 17 in the same manner. Figure 13 illustrates the change in pointing of the center point of the field of view of the acquisition sensor on terminal 22 when transmit beam 17 strikes that terminal. The portions of the field of views defined in terminal 22 are identified by like numbers used in connection with the terminal 12 apparatus, but are given the suffix &quot;A.&quot; As a result, the operation in terminal 22 can be understood from the preceding discussion of the operation in terminal 12 provided in connection with Figures 11 and 12. More specifically, as shown in Figure 13, the re-directed field of view 98' with center point 100A' of acquisition sensor 96A is superimposed on the original field of view 56A of telescope 24.</p><p num="p0094">If during the tracking mode of operation, the signal power drops below that required for tracking, terminal 12 automatically transitions to the final stage of the acquisition logic and follows the acquisition logic either to notification that the acquisition and therefore the link has failed or that the track has been re-established. This results in robust performance and minimizes the impacts of interruptions in the link between the terminals.</p><p num="p0095">Those skilled in the art will recognize that the preferred embodiments may be altered and modified without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the accompanying claims.</p></description><claims lang="DE" status="new"><claim id="c-de-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Eine Vorrichtung in einer ersten Endeinrichtung (12) zum Ausrichten und Aussenden eines ersten Datenübertragungsstrahls (16) von der ersten Endeinrichtung, die sich auf einem erdumkreisenden Satelliten (10) befindet, zu einem Strahlempfänger (25), der sich auf einer zweiten Endeinrichtung (22) befindet, und für ein Ausrichten eines von der zweiten Endeinrichtung ausgesendeten zweiten Datenübertragungsstrahls (17) mit einem ersten Strahlempfänger, der sich auf der ersten Endeinrichtung befindet, um eine Verfolgung des zweiten Strahls mit ausreichender Genauigkeit zu ermöglichen, um Datenübertragung mit dem zweiten Strahl zu ermöglichen, wobei die Vorrichtung umfasst:
