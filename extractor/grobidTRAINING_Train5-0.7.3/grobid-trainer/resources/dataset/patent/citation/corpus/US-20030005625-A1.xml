Specifically, the invention relates to portable planters for use in limited spaces. </p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading><p>[0002] The use of horticultural containers or planters has enabled gardeners to enjoy their pastime in spaces that are otherwise unsuitable for plant material. Container gardens allow anything from an apartment terrace to an urban rooftop to become an oasis for horticultural hobbyists. Unfortunately, such gardens usually exist in limited spaces, and the containers must be moved for space or seasonal considerations. </p><p>[0003] Planter structures addressed to these situations are known per se. For example, <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,246</ref> to Fennell is directed to a portable box garden assembly having a main elongated compartmentalized rectangular box and a raised center section. It contains nine compartments, six for low growing plants and three for taller plants. Four wheels at each corner aid in mobility with two locking wheels to ensure stability and prevent movement. </p><p>[0004] <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,040</ref> to White-Wexler discusses a decorative, terraced planter provides separate plant beds in individual compartments defined within an integrally formed housing of rigid, unitary construction. Each compartment can hold plants and soil separately from those in the other compartments, so that a mix of plants having differing soil and watering needs can be grown together within the planter. The compartments have holes at their bottoms to permit excess water to escape, and the planter preferably has a drip pan beneath the housing to catch the excess water. Stand-offs between the housing and the drip pan permit evaporation of water from the drip pan. Preferably, the tops of the compartments are at different levels, so as to form tiers or rows of plant beds, one above another, much like those of a hillside, terraced garden. </p><p>[0005] <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 4,115,950</ref> to Lantai sets forth method and apparatus for increasing the production of tuber-producing plants per unit area. A seed-tuber is planted in soil that is contained in a first box or frame unit. As the plant grows it develops new leaves and axil-buds. When the plant reaches a given height, which is different for different plants, a new layer of soil is added to the first box or frame unit. The new layer of soil does not completely cover the plant. Instead, a layer of soil is added such that the apical meristem is located at the soil surface or about one cm. below the soil surface. As the plant continues to grow another new layer of soil is again added in the manner described. When the level of the soil approaches the top of the first box or frame unit, a second box or frame unit designed to fit on top of the first box or frame unit is placed on top of the first box or frame unit. This second box or frame unit is open at the top and bottom, whereas the first box or frame unit may have a bottom plate. New layers of soil are then added in the second box or frame unit in the manner and at the times described above with reference to the first box or frame unit. This process is repeated with additional boxes or frame units being piled one on top of the other and new layers of soil added. After the last layer of soil has been added the plant is allowed to grow until it is ready for harvesting. </p> <p>[0006] Although these arrangements offer some advantages over standard planter systems, they are relatively complex and expensive. It can be seen from the foregoing that the need exists for a simple, inexpensive tiered planter system that provides fabrication, portability, and functional advantages, overcoming the deficiencies of known arrangements. </p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading><p>[0007] These and other objects are achieved by providing a tiered planter including a frame assembly including at least one front frame member. Also included is at least one back frame member having a height greater than that of the at least one front frame member.
