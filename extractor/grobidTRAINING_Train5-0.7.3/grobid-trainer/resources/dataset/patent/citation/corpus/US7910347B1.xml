The invention relates to the field of peroxycarboxylic acid biosynthesis and enzyme catalysis. More specifically, an enzyme catalyst comprising a variant enzyme having perhydrolytic activity is provided having an increase in the ratio of peracetic acid formation (PAAF) specific activity relative to peracetic acid hydrolysis (PAAH) specific activity (PAAF/PAAH ratio) when compared to the PAAF/PAAH ratio of the Thermotoga maritima wild-type perhydrolase. Use of the variant enzyme enhances the yield and stability of the peracid produced by enzymatic perhydrolysis. Methods of using the present enzyme catalyst to produce peroxycarboxylic acids are also provided.</p><p>BACKGROUND
Peroxycarboxylic acid compositions can be effective antimicrobial agents. Methods of using peroxycarboxylic acids to clean, disinfect, and/or sanitize hard surfaces, textiles, meat products, living plant tissues, and medical devices against undesirable microbial growth have been described (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,047</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,807</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat.

No. 5,683,724</bibl>). Peroxycarboxylic acids have also been used in a various bleaching applications including, but not limited to, wood pulp bleaching/delignification and laundry care applications (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">European Patent 1040222B1</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,018</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 3,974,082</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 5,296,161</bibl>; and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,554</bibl>). The desired efficacious concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid may vary according to the product application (for example, ca. 500 ppm to 1000 ppm for medical instrument disinfection, ca. 30 ppm to 80 ppm for laundry bleaching or disinfection applications) in 1 min to 5 min reaction time at neutral pH.
Enzymes structurally classified as members of family 7 of the carbohydrate esterases (CE-7) have been employed as perhydrolases to catalyze the reaction of hydrogen peroxide (or alternative peroxide reagent) with alkyl esters of carboxylic acids in water at a basic to acidic pH range (from ca. pH 10 to ca. pH 5) to produce an efficacious concentration of a peroxycarboxylic acid for such applications as disinfection (such as medical instruments, hard surfaces, textiles), bleaching (such as wood pulp or paper pulp processing/delignification, textile bleaching and laundry care applications), and other laundry care applications such as destaining, deodorizing, and sanitization (Published <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Patent Application Nos. 2008/0176783, 2008/0176299, and 2009/0005590</bibl> and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/638,635</bibl> to <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">DiCosimo et al.</bibl>). The CE-7 enzymes have been found to have high specific activity for perhydrolysis of esters, particularly acetyl esters of alcohols, diols and glycerols. However, CE-7 perhydrolases may also hydrolyze the carboxylic acid ester substrate. As such, it is often preferable to employ an enzyme catalyst having high selectivity for perhydrolysis (P) relative to hydrolysis (H) when synthesizing peroxycarboxylic acids from carboxylic acid esters (i.e., an enzyme catalyst having a higher "P to H" ratio). <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/572,094 to DiCosimo et al</bibl>. describes several variant CE-7 perhydrolases derived from several Thermotoga sp. having higher perhydrolytic specific activity and/or improved selectivity for perhydrolysis when used to prepare peroxycarboxylic acid from carboxylic acid esters.
Although the CE-7 family of carbohydrate esterases has been identified as a class of perhydrolytic enzymes having desirable specific activities for peroxycarboxylic acid formation (e.g., peracetic acid formation; PAAF) and/or desirable perhydrolysis to hydrolysis (P/H) ratios for carboxylic acid ester substrates, these enzymes may also have an undesirable enzymatic activity for hydrolyzing the peroxycarboxylic acid product (e.g., peracetic acid hydrolysis; PAAH) to the corresponding carboxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide. As such, an enzyme catalyst comprising a CE-7 perhydrolase characterized by a higher PAAF/PAAH ratio may provide greater peroxycarboxylic acid stability in formulations comprising the enzyme catalyst.
The problem to be solved is to provide an enzyme catalyst comprising a CE-7 carbohydrate esterase having perhydrolytic activity and a higher PAAF/PAAH ratio of specific activities.</p><p>SUMMARY

As used herein, the term "substrate" or "carboxylic acid ester substrate" will refer to the reaction components enzymatically perhydrolyzed using the present enzyme catalyst in the presence of a suitable source of peroxygen, such as hydrogen peroxide. In one embodiment, the substrate comprises at least one ester group capable of being enzymatically perhydrolyzed using the enzyme catalyst, whereby a peroxycarboxylic acid is produced.
As used herein, the term "perhydrolysis" is defined as the reaction of a selected substrate with a source of hydrogen peroxide to form a peroxycarboxylic acid. Typically, inorganic peroxide is reacted with the selected substrate in the presence of a catalyst to produce the peroxycarboxylic acid. As used herein, the term "chemical perhydrolysis" includes perhydrolysis reactions in which a substrate (such as a peroxycarboxylic acid precursor) is combined with a source of hydrogen peroxide wherein peroxycarboxylic acid is formed in the absence of an enzyme catalyst. As used herein, the term "enzymatic perhydrolysis" refers a reaction of a selected substrate with a source of hydrogen peroxide to form a peroxycarboxylic acid, wherein the reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme catalyst having perhydrolysis activity.

As used herein, "PAAF/PAAH ratio" refers to the ratio of the specific activities of the variant enzyme catalyst for producing peracetic acid from a carboxylic acid ester substrate and for hydrolyzing peracetic acid into acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Enzymatically-produced peracids in reaction formulations comprising an enzyme catalyst having a perhydrolytic enzyme having an increased PAAF/PAAH ratio of specific activities are typically more stable as the peracid is less likely to be hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide when the peracid formulation comprises the perhydrolytic enzyme. In one embodiment, reactions to measure peracetic acid formation (PAAF) specific activity are run at ca. 25[deg.] C. in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.2) containing 100 mM triacetin, 100 mM hydrogen peroxide and approximately 2.5 [mu]g/mL of heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli strain KLP18 expressing wild-type or variant perhydrolase (see example 13). In another embodiment, the reactions to measure peracetic acid hydrolysis (PAAH) specific activity are run at ca. 25[deg.] C., phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.2) containing approximately 2000 ppm peracetic acid (ca. 26.3 mM) and 25 [mu]g/mL of heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli strain KLP18 expressing wild-type or variant perhydrolase (see Example 14).

As used herein, "identical assay conditions" or "same assay conditions" refer to the conditions used to measure the peracid formation (i.e., perhydrolysis of a carboxylic acid ester substrate) specific activity or the peroxycarboxylic acid hydrolysis specific activity of the variant polypeptide relative to the respective specific activities of the polypeptide from which is was derived (i.e., Thermotoga maritima wild-type acetyl xylan esterase of SEQ ID NO: 2). The assay conditions used to measure the respective specific activities should be as close to identical as possible such that only the structure of the polypeptide having perhydrolytic activity varies. The carboxylic acid ester substrate and the corresponding peroxycarboxylic acid used to measure the respective perhydrolytic specific activity and peracid hydrolysis specific activities may vary depending upon the desired substrate/product combination. In one embodiment, the perhydrolytic specific activity is measured using triacetin as a substrate and the peracid hydrolysis specific activity is measured using peracetic acid as the respective peracid. In one embodiment, reactions used to measure peracetic acid formation (PAAF) specific activity are run at ca. 25[deg.] C. in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.2) containing 100 mM triacetin, 100 mM hydrogen peroxide and approximately 2.5 [mu]g/mL of heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli strain KLP18 expressing wild-type or variant perhydrolase (see example 13). In another embodiment, the reactions to measure peracetic acid hydrolysis (PAAH) specific activity are run at ca. 25[deg.] C., phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.2) containing approximately 2000 ppm peracetic acid (ca. 26.3 mM) and 25 [mu]g/mL of heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli strain KLP18 expressing wild-type or variant perhydrolase (see Example 14).

Typically, the Xaa at amino acid residue position 187 is glycine, alanine, proline, tryptophan, or threonine. Two of the three amino acid residues belonging to the catalytic triad are in bold. In one embodiment, the Xaa at amino acid residue position 187 is selected from the group consisting of glycine, alanine, proline, tryptophan, and threonine.
Further analysis of the conserved motifs within the CE-7 carbohydrate esterase family indicates the presence of an additional conserved motif (LXD at amino acid positions 272-274 of SEQ ID NO: 2) that may be used to further define a member of the CE-7 carbohydrate esterase family.

Variant Polypeptides Having an Increased PAAF/PAAH Ratio
The present variant polypeptides were derived from the Thermotoga maritima wild-type acetyl xylan esterase that has been previously demonstrated to have significant perhydrolytic activity for producing peroxycarboxylic acids from carboxylic acid esters and a source of peroxygen, such as hydrogen peroxide (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008-0176299</bibl> to DiCosimo et al.). However, the Thermotoga maritima wild-type acetyl xylan esterase also has the ability to hydrolyze the peroxycarboxylic acid product into the corresponding carboxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide.
Given that the desired peroxycarboxylic acid-based bleaching or disinfecting formulation comprising enzymatically-produced peroxycarboxylic acid will likely contain at least some of the active enzyme catalyst, there is a need to identify at least one variant polypeptide having a higher PAAF/PAAH ratio when compared to the PAAF/PAAH ratio of the Thermotoga maritima wild-type enzyme under the same (or as reasonably identical as possible) assay conditions. In one embodiment, the increase in the PAAF/PAAH ratio preferably occurs across the pH range where the enzyme is typically active. In another embodiment, the increase in the PAAF/PAAH ratio preferably occurs without a substantial drop in the perhydrolysis to hydrolysis reaction (P/H) ratio of the enzyme for the carboxylic acid ester substrate (i.e., the perhydrolytic reactions typically occur in an aqueous reaction formulation where the carboxylic acid ester may be hydrolyzed by the enzyme catalyst).
A library of variant polypeptides was created from the wild-type Thermotoga maritima perhydrolase (SEQ ID NO: 2) and assayed for an increase in the ratio of perhydrolytic specific activity relative to the peroxycarboxylic acid hydrolysis activity. In order to measure this ratio, an assay was developed to measure the specific activity of the variant polypeptide for peracetic acid formation ("PAAF") from triacetin (100 mM) and hydrogen peroxide (100 mM) at ca. 25[deg.] C. in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.2) using heat-treated extract supernatant total protein produced in E. coli strain KLP18 expressing wild-type or variant perhydrolase (Example 13). The specific activity of the variant polypeptide for hydrolyzing the peroxycarboxylic acid (PAAH) was measured using ca. 2000 ppm peracetic acid (ca. 26.3 mM) in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.2) at ca. 25[deg.] C. using heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli strain KLP18 expressing wild-type or variant perhydrolase (see Example 14). The PAAF specific activity was divided by the PAAH specific activity to determine the PAAF/PAAH ratio.

The carboxylic acid ester is present in the aqueous reaction formulation at a concentration sufficient to produce the desired concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid upon enzyme-catalyzed perhydrolysis. The carboxylic acid ester need not be completely soluble in the aqueous reaction formulation, but has sufficient solubility to permit conversion of the ester by the perhydrolase catalyst to the corresponding peroxycarboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid ester is present in the aqueous reaction formulation at a concentration of 0.0005 wt % to 40 wt % of the aqueous reaction formulation, preferably at a concentration of 0.01 wt % to 20 wt % of the aqueous reaction formulation, and more preferably at a concentration of 0.05 wt % to 10 wt % of the aqueous reaction formulation. The wt % of carboxylic acid ester may optionally be greater than the solubility limit of the carboxylic acid ester, such that the concentration of the carboxylic acid ester is at least 0.0005 wt % in the aqueous reaction formulation that is comprised of water, enzyme catalyst, and source of peroxide, where the remainder of the carboxylic acid ester remains as a second separate phase of a two-phase aqueous/organic reaction formulation. Not all of the added carboxylic acid ester must immediately dissolve in the aqueous reaction formulation, and after an initial mixing of all reaction components, additional continuous or discontinuous mixing is optional.
The peroxycarboxylic acids produced by the present reaction components may vary depending upon the selected substrates, so long as the present enzyme catalyst is used. In one embodiment, the peroxycarboxylic acid produced is peracetic acid, perpropionic acid, perbutyric acid, perlactic acid, perglycolic acid, permethoxyacetic acid, per-[beta]-hydroxybutyric acid, or mixtures thereof.
The peroxygen source may include, but is not limited to, hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen peroxide adducts (e.g., urea-hydrogen peroxide adduct (carbamide peroxide)), perborate salts and percarbonate salts. The concentration of peroxygen compound in the aqueous reaction formulation may range from 0.0033 wt % to about 50 wt %, preferably from 0.033 wt % to about 40 wt %, more preferably from 0.33 wt % to about 30 wt %.
Many perhydrolase catalysts (such as whole cells, permeabilized whole cells, and partially purified whole cell extracts) have been reported to have catalase activity (EC 1.11.1.6). Catalases catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. In one aspect, the enzyme catalyst having perhydrolase activity lacks catalase activity. In another aspect, a catalase inhibitor is added to the aqueous reaction formulation. Examples of catalase inhibitors include, but are not limited to, sodium azide and hydroxylamine sulfate. One of skill in the art can adjust the concentration of catalase inhibitor as needed. The concentration of the catalase inhibitor typically ranges from 0.1 mM to about 1 M; preferably about 1 mM to about 50 mM; more preferably from about 1 mM to about 20 mM. In one aspect, sodium azide concentration typically ranges from about 20 mM to about 60 mM while hydroxylamine sulfate is concentration is typically about 0.5 mM to about 30 mM, preferably about 10 mM.
The catalase activity in a host cell can be down-regulated or eliminated by disrupting expression of the gene(s) responsible for the catalase activity using well known techniques including, but not limited to, transposon mutagenesis, RNA antisense expression, targeted mutagenesis, and random mutagenesis. In a preferred embodiment, the gene(s) encoding the endogenous catalase activity are down-regulated or disrupted (i.e., "knocked-out"). As used herein, a "disrupted" gene is one where the activity and/or function of the protein encoded by the modified gene is no longer present. Means to disrupt a gene are well-known in the art and may include, but are not limited to, insertions, deletions, or mutations to the gene so long as the activity and/or function of the corresponding protein is no longer present. In a further preferred embodiment, the production host is an E. coli production host comprising a disrupted catalase gene selected from the group consisting of katG and katE (see <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008-0176783</bibl> to DiCosimo et al.). In another embodiment, the production host is an E. coli strain comprising a down-regulation and/or disruption in both katG and katE catalase genes. An E. coli strain comprising a double-knockout of katG and katE has been prepared and is described as E. coli strain KLP18 (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008-0176783</bibl> to DiCosimo et al.).
The concentration of the catalyst in the aqueous reaction formulation depends on the specific catalytic activity of the catalyst, and is chosen to obtain the desired rate of reaction. The weight of catalyst in perhydrolysis reactions typically ranges from 0.0001 mg to 50 mg per mL of total reaction volume, preferably from 0.0005 mg to 10 mg per mL, more preferably from 0.0010 mg to 2.0 mg per mL. The catalyst may also be immobilized on a soluble or insoluble support using methods well-known to those skilled in the art; see for example, <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Immobilization of Enzymes and Cells; Gordon F. Bickerstaff, Editor; Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., USA; 1997</bibl>. The use of immobilized catalysts permits the recovery and reuse of the catalyst in subsequent reactions. The enzyme catalyst may be in the form of whole microbial cells, permeabilized microbial cells, microbial cell extracts, partially-purified or purified enzymes, and mixtures thereof.
In one aspect, the concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid generated by the combination of chemical perhydrolysis and enzymatic perhydrolysis of the carboxylic acid ester is sufficient to provide an effective concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid for disinfection, bleaching, sanitization, deodorizing or destaining at a desired pH. In another aspect, the present methods provide combinations of enzymes and enzyme substrates to produce the desired effective concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid, where, in the absence of added enzyme, there is a significantly lower concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid produced. Although there may be some chemical perhydrolysis of the enzyme substrate by direct chemical reaction of inorganic peroxide with the enzyme substrate, there may not be a sufficient concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid generated to provide an effective concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid in the desired applications, and a significant increase in total peroxycarboxylic acid concentration is achieved by the addition of an appropriate perhydrolase catalyst to the aqueous reaction formulation.
In one aspect of the invention, the concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid generated (e.g. peracetic acid) by the enzymatic perhydrolysis is at least about 2 ppm, preferably at least 20 ppm, preferably at least 100 ppm, more preferably at least about 200 ppm peroxycarboxylic acid, more preferably at least 300 ppm, more preferably at least 500 ppm, more preferably at least 700 ppm, more preferably at least about 1000 ppm peroxycarboxylic acid, most preferably at least 2000 ppm peroxycarboxylic acid within 5 minutes more preferably within 1 minute of initiating the enzymatic perhydrolysis reaction. In a second aspect of the invention, the concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid generated (e.g. peracetic acid) by the enzymatic perhydrolysis is at least about 2 ppm, preferably at least 20 ppm, preferably at least 30 ppm, more preferably at least about 40 ppm peroxycarboxylic acid, more preferably at least 50 ppm, more preferably at least 60 ppm, more preferably at least 70 ppm, more preferably at least about 80 ppm peroxycarboxylic acid, most preferably at least 100 ppm peroxycarboxylic acid within 5 minutes, more preferably within 1 minute, of initiating the enzymatic perhydrolysis reaction (i.e., time measured from combining the reaction components to form the formulation).
The aqueous formulation comprising the peroxycarboxylic acid may be optionally diluted with diluent comprising water, or a solution predominantly comprised of water, to produce a formulation with the desired lower target concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid. In one aspect, the reaction time required to produce the desired concentration (or concentration range) of peroxycarboxylic acid is about 5 minutes or less, more preferably about 1 minute or less.
In other aspects, the surface or inanimate object contaminated with a concentration of a biological contaminant(s) is contacted with the peroxycarboxylic acid formed in accordance with the processes described herein within about 1 minute to about 168 hours of combining said reaction components, or within about 1 minute to about 48 hours, or within about 1 minute to 2 hours of combining said reaction components, or any such time interval therein.
In another aspect, the peroxycarboxylic acid formed in accordance with the processes describe herein is used in a laundry care application wherein the peroxycarboxylic acid is contacted with clothing or a textile to provide a benefit, such as disinfecting, bleaching, destaining, deodorizing and/or a combination thereof. The peroxycarboxylic acid may be used in a variety of laundry care products including, but not limited to, laundry or textile pre-wash treatments, laundry detergents or additives, stain removers, bleaching compositions, deodorizing compositions, and rinsing agents. In one embodiment, the present process to produce a peroxycarboxylic acid for a target surface is conducted in situ.
In the context of laundry care applications, the term "contacting an article of clothing or textile" means that the article of clothing or textile is exposed to a formulation disclosed herein. To this end, there are a number of formats the formulation may be used to treat articles of clothing or textiles including, but not limited to, liquid, solids, gel, paste, bars, tablets, spray, foam, powder, or granules and can be delivered via hand dosing, unit dosing, dosing from a substrate, spraying and automatic dosing from a laundry washing or drying machine. Granular compositions can also be in compact form; liquid compositions can also be in a concentrated form.
When the formulations disclosed herein are used in a laundry washing machine, the formulation can further contain components typical to laundry detergents. For example, typical components included, but are not limited to, surfactants, bleaching agents, bleach activators, additional enzymes, suds suppressors, dispersants, lime-soap dispersants, soil suspension and anti-redeposition agents, softening agents, corrosion inhibitors, tarnish inhibitors, germicides, pH adjusting agents, non-builder alkalinity sources, chelating agents, organic and/or inorganic fillers, solvents, hydrotropes, optical brighteners, dyes, and perfumes.
The formulations disclosed herein can also be used as detergent additive products in solid or liquid form. Such additive products are intended to supplement or boost the performance of conventional detergent compositions and can be added at any stage of the cleaning process.
In connection with the present systems and methods for laundry care where the peracid is generated for one or more of bleaching, stain removal, and odor reduction, the concentration of peracid generated (e.g., peracetic acid) by the perhydrolysis of at least one carboxylic acid ester may be at least about 2 ppm, preferably at least 20 ppm, preferably at least 100 ppm, and more preferably at least about 200 ppm peracid. In connection with the present systems and methods for laundry care where the peracid is generated for disinfection or sanitization, the concentration of peracid generated (e.g., peracetic acid) by the perhydrolysis of at least one carboxylic acid ester may be at least about 2 ppm, more preferably at least 20 ppm, more preferably at least 200 ppm, more preferably at least 500 ppm, more preferably at least 700 ppm, more preferably at least about 1000 ppm peracid, most preferably at least 2000 ppm peracid within 10 minutes, preferably within 5 minutes, and most preferably within 1 minute of initiating the perhydrolysis reaction. The product formulation comprising the peracid may be optionally diluted with water, or a solution predominantly comprised of water, to produce a formulation with the desired lower concentration of peracid. In one aspect of the present methods and systems, the reaction time required to produce the desired concentration of peracid is not greater than about two hours, preferably not greater than about 30 minutes, more preferably not greater than about 10 minutes, even more preferably not greater than about 5 minutes, and most preferably in about 1 minute or less.
The temperature of the reaction is chosen to control both the reaction rate and the stability of the enzyme catalyst activity. The temperature of the reaction may range from just above the freezing point of the aqueous reaction formulation (approximately 0[deg.] C.) to about 85[deg.] C., with a preferred range of reaction temperature of from about 5[deg.] C. to about 55[deg.] C.
The pH of the aqueous reaction formulation while enzymatically producing peroxycarboxylic acid is maintained at a pH ranging from about 5.0 to about 10.0, preferably about 6.5 to about 8.5, and yet even more preferably about 6.5 to about 7.5. In one embodiment, the pH of the aqueous reaction formulation ranges from about 6.5 to about 8.5 for at least 30 minutes after combining the reaction components. The pH of the aqueous reaction formulation may be adjusted or controlled by the addition or incorporation of a suitable buffer, including, but not limited to, phosphate, pyrophosphate, bicarbonate, acetate, or citrate. In one embodiment, the buffer is selected from a phosphate buffer and a bicarbonate buffer. The concentration of buffer, when employed, is typically from 0.1 mM to 1.0 M, preferably from 1 mM to 300 mM, most preferably from 10 mM to 100 mM. In another aspect of the present invention, no buffer is added to the reaction mixture while enzymatically producing peroxycarboxylic acid.
In yet another aspect, the enzymatic perhydrolysis aqueous reaction formulation may contain an organic solvent that acts as a dispersant to enhance the rate of dissolution of the carboxylic acid ester in the aqueous reaction formulation. Such solvents include, but are not limited to, propylene glycol methyl ether, acetone, cyclohexanone, diethylene glycol butyl ether, tripropylene glycol methyl ether, diethylene glycol methyl ether, propylene glycol butyl ether, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, cyclohexanol, benzyl alcohol, isopropanol, ethanol, propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof.
In another aspect, the enzymatic perhydrolysis product may contain additional components that provide desirable functionality. These additional components include, but are not limited to, buffers, detergent builders, thickening agents, emulsifiers, surfactants, wetting agents, corrosion inhibitors (e.g., benzotriazole), enzyme stabilizers, and peroxide stabilizers (e.g., metal ion chelating agents). Many of the additional components are well known in the detergent industry (see, for example, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,532</bibl>; hereby incorporated by reference). Examples of emulsifiers include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinylpyrrolidone. Examples of thickening agents include, but are not limited to, LAPONITE(R) RD, corn starch, PVP, CARBOWAX(R), CARBOPOL(R), CABOSIL(R), polysorbate 20, PVA, and lecithin.

In another aspect, the enzymatic perhydrolysis product may be pre-mixed to generate the desired concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid prior to contacting the surface or inanimate object to be disinfected.
In another aspect, the enzymatic perhydrolysis product is not pre-mixed to generate the desired concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid prior to contacting the surface or inanimate object to be disinfected, but instead, the components of the aqueous reaction formulation that generate the desired concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid are contacted with the surface or inanimate object to be disinfected and/or bleached or destained, generating the desired concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid. In some embodiments, the components of the aqueous reaction formulation combine or mix at the locus. In some embodiments, the reaction components are delivered or applied to the locus and subsequently mix or combine to generate the desired concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid.
Production of Peroxycarboxylic Acids Using a Perhydrolase Catalyst
The peroxycarboxylic acids, once produced, are quite reactive and may decrease in concentration over extended periods of time, depending on variables that include, but are not limited to, temperature and pH. As such, it may be desirable to keep the various reaction components separated, especially for liquid formulations. In one aspect, the hydrogen peroxide source is separate from either the substrate or the perhydrolase catalyst, preferably from both. This can be accomplished using a variety of techniques including, but not limited to, the use of multicompartment chambered dispensers (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 4,585,150</bibl>) and at the time of use physically combining the perhydrolase catalyst with a source of peroxygen (such as hydrogen peroxide) and the present substrates to initiate the aqueous enzymatic perhydrolysis reaction. The perhydrolase catalyst may optionally be immobilized within the body of reaction chamber or separated (e.g., filtered, etc.) from the reaction product comprising the peroxycarboxylic acid prior to contacting the surface and/or object targeted for treatment. The perhydrolase catalyst may be in a liquid matrix or in a solid form (e.g., powder or tablet) or embedded within a solid matrix that is subsequently mixed with the substrates to initiate the enzymatic perhydrolysis reaction. In a further aspect, the perhydrolase catalyst may be contained within a dissolvable or porous pouch that may be added to the aqueous substrate matrix to initiate enzymatic perhydrolysis. In yet a further aspect, the perhydrolase catalyst may comprise the contents contained within a separate compartment of a dissolvable or porous pouch that has at least one additional compartment for the containment contents comprising the ester substrate and/or source of peroxide. In an additional further aspect, a powder comprising the enzyme catalyst is suspended in the substrate (e.g., triacetin), and at time of use is mixed with a source of peroxygen in water.
Method for Determining the Concentration of Peroxycarboxylic Acid and Hydrogen Peroxide.
A variety of analytical methods can be used in the present method to analyze the reactants and products including, but not limited to, titration, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), mass spectroscopy (MS), capillary electrophoresis (CE), the analytical procedure described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. Karst et al. (Anal. Chem., 69(17):3623-3627 (1997))</bibl>, and the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothazoline)-6-sulfonate (ABTS) assay (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">S. Minning, et al., Analytica Chimica Acta 378:293-298 (1999)</bibl> and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 2004/058961 A1</bibl>) as described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0176783</bibl>.
Determination of Minimum Biocidal Concentration of Peroxycarboxylic Acids
The method described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">J. Gabrielson et al. (J. Microbiol. Methods 50: 63-73 (2002))</bibl> can be employed for determination of the Minimum Biocidal Concentration (MBC) of peroxycarboxylic acids, or of hydrogen peroxide and enzyme substrates. The assay method is based on XTT reduction inhibition, where XTT (2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt, monosodium salt) is a redox dye that indicates microbial respiratory activity by a change in optical density (OD) measured at 490 nm or 450 nm. However, there are a variety of other methods available for testing the activity of disinfectants and antiseptics including, but not limited to, viable plate counts, direct microscopic counts, dry weight, turbidity measurements, absorbance, and bioluminescence (see, for example <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Brock, Semour S., Disinfection, Sterilization, and Preservation, 5&lt;th &gt;edition, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa., USA; 2001</bibl>).
Uses of Enzymatically Prepared Peroxycarboxylic Acid Compositions
The enzyme catalyst-generated peroxycarboxylic acid produced according to the present method can be used in a variety of hard surface/inanimate object applications for reduction of concentrations of biological contaminants, such as decontamination of medical instruments (e.g., endoscopes), textiles (such as garments and carpets), food preparation surfaces, food storage and food-packaging equipment, materials used for the packaging of food products, chicken hatcheries and grow-out facilities, animal enclosures, and spent process waters that have microbial and/or virucidal activity. The enzyme-generated peroxycarboxylic acids may be used in formulations designed to inactivate prions (e.g., certain proteases) to additionally provide biocidal activity (see <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 7,550,420</bibl> to DiCosimo et al.).
In one aspect, the peroxycarboxylic acid composition is useful as a disinfecting agent for non-autoclavable medical instruments and food packaging equipment. As the peroxycarboxylic acid-containing formulation may be prepared using GRAS or food-grade components (enzyme, enzyme substrate, hydrogen peroxide, and buffer), the enzyme-generated peroxycarboxylic acid may also be used for decontamination of animal carcasses, meat, fruits and vegetables, or for decontamination of prepared foods. The enzyme-generated peroxycarboxylic acid may be incorporated into a product whose final form is a powder, liquid, gel, film, solid or aerosol. The enzyme-generated peroxycarboxylic acid may be diluted to a concentration that still provides an efficacious decontamination.
The compositions comprising an efficacious concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid can be used to disinfect surfaces and/or objects contaminated (or suspected of being contaminated) with biological contaminants, such as pathogenic microbial contaminants, by contacting the surface or object with the products produced by the present processes. As used herein, "contacting" refers to placing a disinfecting composition comprising an effective concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid in contact with the surface or inanimate object suspected of contamination with a biological contaminant for a period of time sufficient to clean and disinfect. Contacting includes spraying, treating, immersing, flushing, pouring on or in, mixing, combining, painting, coating, applying, affixing to and otherwise communicating a peroxycarboxylic acid solution or composition comprising an efficacious concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid, or a solution or composition that forms an efficacious concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid, with the surface or inanimate object suspected of being contaminated with a concentration of a biological contaminant. The disinfectant compositions may be combined with a cleaning composition to provide both cleaning and disinfection. Alternatively, a cleaning agent (e.g., a surfactant or detergent) may be incorporated into the formulation to provide both cleaning and disinfection in a single composition.
The compositions comprising an efficacious concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid can also contain at least one additional antimicrobial agent, combinations of prion-degrading proteases, a virucide, a sporicide, or a biocide. Combinations of these agents with the peroxycarboxylic acid produced by the claimed processes can provide for increased and/or synergistic effects when used to clean and disinfect surfaces and/or objects contaminated (or suspected of being contaminated) with biological contaminants. Suitable antimicrobial agents include carboxylic esters (e.g., p-hydroxy alkyl benzoates and alkyl cinnamates), sulfonic acids (e.g., dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid), iodo-compounds or active halogen compounds (e.g., elemental halogens, halogen oxides (e.g., NaOCl, HOCl, HOBr, ClO2), iodine, interhalides (e.g., iodine monochloride, iodine dichloride, iodine trichloride, iodine tetrachloride, bromine chloride, iodine monobromide, or iodine dibromide), polyhalides, hypochlorite salts, hypochlorous acid, hypobromite salts, hypobromous acid, chloro- and bromo-hydantoins, chlorine dioxide, and sodium chlorite), organic peroxides including benzoyl peroxide, alkyl benzoyl peroxides, ozone, singlet oxygen generators, and mixtures thereof, phenolic derivatives (e.g., o-phenyl phenol, o-benzyl-p-chlorophenol, tert-amyl phenol and C1-C6 alkyl hydroxy benzoates), quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., alkyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, dialkyldimethyl ammonium chloride and mixtures thereof), and mixtures of such antimicrobial agents, in an amount sufficient to provide the desired degree of microbial protection. Effective amounts of antimicrobial agents include about 0.001 wt % to about 60 wt % antimicrobial agent, about 0.01 wt % to about 15 wt % antimicrobial agent, or about 0.08 wt % to about 2.5 wt % antimicrobial agent.
In one aspect, the peroxycarboxylic acids formed by the process can be used to reduce the concentration of viable biological contaminants (such as a microbial population) when applied on and/or at a locus. As used herein, a "locus" comprises part or all of a target surface suitable for disinfecting or bleaching. Target surfaces include all surfaces that can potentially be contaminated with biological contaminants. Non-limiting examples include equipment surfaces found in the food or beverage industry (such as tanks, conveyors, floors, drains, coolers, freezers, equipment surfaces, walls, valves, belts, pipes, drains, joints, crevasses, combinations thereof, and the like); building surfaces (such as walls, floors and windows); non-food-industry related pipes and drains, including water treatment facilities, pools and spas, and fermentation tanks; hospital or veterinary surfaces (such as walls, floors, beds, equipment (such as endoscopes), clothing worn in hospital/veterinary or other healthcare settings, including clothing, scrubs, shoes, and other hospital or veterinary surfaces); restaurant surfaces; bathroom surfaces; toilets; clothes and shoes; surfaces of barns or stables for livestock, such as poultry, cattle, dairy cows, goats, horses and pigs; hatcheries for poultry or for shrimp; and pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical surfaces (e.g., pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical manufacturing equipment, pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical ingredients, pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical excipients). Additional hard surfaces include food products, such as beef, poultry, pork, vegetables, fruits, seafood, combinations thereof, and the like. The locus can also include water absorbent materials such as infected linens or other textiles. The locus also includes harvested plants or plant products including seeds, corms, tubers, fruit, and vegetables, growing plants, and especially crop growing plants, including cereals, leaf vegetables and salad crops, root vegetables, legumes, berried fruits, citrus fruits and hard fruits.
Non-limiting examples of hard surface materials are metals (e.g., steel, stainless steel, chrome, titanium, iron, copper, brass, aluminum, and alloys thereof), minerals (e.g., concrete), polymers and plastics (e.g., polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, poly(meth)acrylate, polyacrylonitrile, polybutadiene, poly(acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene), poly(acrylonitrile, butadiene), acrylonitrile butadiene; polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate; and polyamides such as nylon). Additional surfaces include brick, tile, ceramic, porcelain, wood, wood pulp, paper, vinyl, linoleum, and carpet.
The peroxycarboxylic acids formed by the present process may be used to provide a benefit to an article of clothing or a textile including, but not limited to disinfecting, sanitizing, bleaching, destaining, and deodorizing. The peroxycarboxylic acids formed by the present process may be used in any number of laundry care products including, but not limited to textile pre-wash treatments, laundry detergents, laundry detergents or additives, stain removers, bleaching compositions, deodorizing compositions, and rinsing agents, to name a few.
The peroxycarboxylic acids formed by the present process can be used in one or more steps of the wood pulp or paper pulp bleaching/delignification process, particularly where peracetic acid is used (for example, see <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">EP1040222 B1</bibl> and <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,018</bibl> to Devenyns, J.)
Recombinant Microbial Expression
The genes and gene products of the instant sequences may be produced in heterologous host cells, particularly in the cells of microbial hosts. Preferred heterologous host cells for expression of the instant genes and nucleic acid molecules are microbial hosts that can be found within the fungal or bacterial families and which grow over a wide range of temperature, pH values, and solvent tolerances. For example, it is contemplated that any of bacteria, yeast, and filamentous fungi may suitably host the expression of the present nucleic acid molecules. The perhydrolase may be expressed intracellularly, extracellularly, or a combination of both intracellularly and extracellularly, where extracellular expression renders recovery of the desired protein from a fermentation product more facile than methods for recovery of protein produced by intracellular expression. Transcription, translation and the protein biosynthetic apparatus remain invariant relative to the cellular feedstock used to generate cellular biomass; functional genes will be expressed regardless. Examples of host strains include, but are not limited to, bacterial, fungal or yeast species such as Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Saccharomyces, Pichia, Phaffia, Kluyveromyces, Candida, Hansenula, Yarrowia, Salmonella, Bacillus, Acinetobacter, Zymomonas, Agrobacterium, Erythrobacter, Chlorobium, Chromatium, Flavobacterium, Cytophaga, Rhodobacter, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces, Brevibacterium, Corynebacteria, Mycobacterium, Deinococcus, Escherichia, Erwinia, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Methylomonas, Methylobacter, Methylococcus, Methylosinus, Methylomicrobium, Methylocystis, Alcaligenes, Synechocystis, Synechococcus, Anabaena, Thiobacillus, Methanobacterium, Klebsiella, and Myxococcus. In one embodiment, bacterial host strains include Escherichia, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas. In a preferred embodiment, the bacterial host cell is Escherichia coli. 
Industrial Production
A variety of culture methodologies may be applied to produce the perhydrolase catalyst. Large-scale production of a specific gene product overexpressed from a recombinant microbial host may be produced by batch, fed-batch or continuous culture methodologies. Batch and fed-batch culturing methods are common and well known in the art and examples may be found in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Thomas D. Brock in Biotechnology: A Textbook of Industrial Microbiology, Second Edition, Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, Mass. (1989)</bibl> and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Deshpande, Mukund V., Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol., 36:227 (1992)</bibl>.
In one embodiment, commercial production of the desired perhydrolase catalyst is accomplished with a continuous culture. Continuous cultures are an open system where a defined culture media is added continuously to a bioreactor and an equal amount of conditioned media is removed simultaneously for processing. Continuous cultures generally maintain the cells at a constant high liquid phase density where cells are primarily in log phase growth. Alternatively, continuous culture may be practiced with immobilized cells where carbon and nutrients are continuously added and valuable products, by-products or waste products are continuously removed from the cell mass. Cell immobilization may be performed using a wide range of solid supports composed of natural and/or synthetic materials.
Recovery of the desired perhydrolase catalysts from a batch or fed-batch fermentation, or continuous culture may be accomplished by any of the methods that are known to those skilled in the art. For example, when the enzyme catalyst is produced intracellularly, the cell paste is separated from the culture medium by centrifugation or membrane filtration, optionally washed with water or an aqueous buffer at a desired pH, then a suspension of the cell paste in an aqueous buffer at a desired pH is homogenized to produce a cell extract containing the desired enzyme catalyst. The cell extract may optionally be filtered through an appropriate filter aid such as celite or silica to remove cell debris prior to a heat-treatment step to precipitate undesired protein from the enzyme catalyst solution. The solution containing the desired enzyme catalyst may then be separated from the precipitated cell debris and protein produced during the heat-treatment step by membrane filtration or centrifugation, and the resulting partially-purified enzyme catalyst solution concentrated by additional membrane filtration, then optionally mixed with an appropriate excipient (for example, maltodextrin, trehalose, sucrose, lactose, sorbitol, mannitol, phosphate buffer, citrate buffer, or mixtures thereof) and spray-dried to produce a solid powder comprising the desired enzyme catalyst. Alternatively, the resulting partially-purified enzyme catalyst solution prepared as described above may be optionally concentrated by additional membrane filtration, and the partially-purified enzyme catalyst solution or resulting enzyme concentrate is then optionally mixed with one or more stabilizing agents (e.g., glycerol, sorbitol, propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, polyols, polymeric polyols, polyvinylalcohol), one or more salts (e.g., sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, or mixtures thereof), and one or more biocides, and maintained as an aqueous solution until used.
When an amount, concentration, or other value or parameter is given either as a range, preferred range, or a list of upper preferable values and lower preferable values, this is to be understood as specifically disclosing all ranges formed from any pair of any upper range limit or preferred value and any lower range limit or preferred value, regardless of whether ranges are separately disclosed. Where a range of numerical values is recited herein, unless otherwise stated, the range is intended to include the endpoints thereof, and all integers and fractions within the range.

The coding sequence of a Thermotoga maritima acetyl xylan esterase (GENBANK(R) accession # NP-227893.1) was synthesized using codons optimized for expression in E. coli (DNA 2.0, Menlo Park, Calif.), and cloned into pUC19 between Pst1 and Xba1 to create the plasmid known as pSW202 (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Patent Application Publication 2008-0176299</bibl>). The codon-optimized sequence is provided as SEQ ID NO:1 encoding the wild-type T. maritima acetyl xylan esterase provided as SEQ ID NO: 2.
A codon change was made in the gene using primer pairs identified as SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 4, and the QUIKCHANGE(R) site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.), according to the manufacturer's instructions, resulting in the amino acid change C277S (SEQ ID NO: 5), to create the plasmid known as pSW202/C277S (SEQ ID NO: 6).

The resulting PCR product was digested with Pst1 and Xba1 and ligated with pUC19 also digested with Pst1 and Xba1. E. coli KLP18 (see <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. 2008-0176299</bibl>; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) was transformed with the ligation mixture and plated onto LB plates supplemented with 0.1 mg ampicillin/mL. Nucleotide sequencing of a random sample indicated a mutation frequency of 2-8 changes per PCR product.</p><p>Example 2</p><p>Screening of Thermotoga maritima Error-Prone PCR Library for Increased Enzyme Activity
Colonies were picked (automated) and placed into 96-well "master plates" containing 0.1 mL LB media supplemented with 0.1 mg ampicillin/mL and grown 16-18 h at 37[deg.] C. and 80% humidity.

Separately, 0.1 mL of 50% glycerol was added to each well of the master plates, which were stored at -80[deg.] C. as stocks. From each well of the induction plates, 0.01 mL of culture was transferred to 96-well "lysis plates" containing 0.09 mL of 56 mg/mL CELLYTIC(TM) Express (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), which were incubated for 30 minutes at 30[deg.] C. From each well of the lysis plates, 0.01 mL of material was transferred to 96-well "assay plates" containing 0.045 mL "assay solution part 1" (50 mM triacetin, 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). To each well of the assay plates was then added 0.045 mL of "assay solution part 2" (50 mM hydrogen peroxide). Plates were gently mixed and incubated for 10 minutes at 30[deg.] C. To each well of the assay plate was added 0.1 mL of "stop buffer" (100 mM o-phenylenediamine and 500 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 2.0). The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 30[deg.] C., after which absorbance at 458 nm was read. T. maritima WT (codon optimized gene (SEQ ID NO:1) encoding the wild type enzyme (SEQ ID NO:2) and T. maritima C277S (SEQ ID NO:5) were incorporated into each plate as controls. Screening of approximately 5000 colonies resulted in the identification of one variant (labeled as "A3") demonstrating activity approximately 3-fold greater than T. maritima C277S (SEQ ID NO:5). Nucleotide sequencing indicated 6 additional amino acid changes in this A3 variant (F241, S35T, Q179L, N275D, S308G, and F317S) when compared to the T. maritima acetyl xylan esterase C277S variant (SEQ ID NO:5).

Reactions were stirred for only the first 30 seconds of reaction to initially mix the reactants and enzyme. A sample from each of the reaction mixtures described above was withdrawn after the first minute of each reaction, and every two minutes thereafter for fifteen minutes, and each sample was analyzed for peracetic acid by reaction with methyl-p-tolyl sulfide (MTS, see below).
Measurement of the rate of peracetic acid production in the reaction mixture was performed using a modification of the method described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Karst et al. (Anal. Chem., 69(17):3623-3627 (1997))</bibl>. A sample (0.040 mL) of the reaction mixture was removed at predetermined times as described above and immediately mixed with 0.960 mL of 5 mM phosphoric acid in water to terminate the reaction by adjusting the pH of the diluted sample to between pH 3 and pH 4. The resulting solution was filtered using an ULTRAFREE(R) MC-filter unit (30,000 Normal Molecular Weight Limit (NMWL), Millipore Corp., Billerica, Mass.; cat #UFC3LKT 00) by centrifugation for 2 min at 12,000 rpm. An aliquot (0.100 mL) of the resulting filtrate was transferred to a 1.5-mL screw cap HPLC vial (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.; #5182-0715) containing 0.300 mL of deionized water, then 0.100 mL of 20 mM MTS (methyl-p-tolyl sulfide) in acetonitrile was added, the vial capped, and the contents briefly mixed prior to a 10 min incubation at ca. 25[deg.] C. in the absence of light. To the vial was then added 0.400 mL of acetonitrile and 0.100 mL of a solution of triphenylphosphine (TPP, 40 mM) in acetonitrile, the vial re-capped, and the resulting solution mixed and incubated at ca. 25[deg.] C. for 30 min in the absence of light. To the vial was then added 0.100 mL of 10 mM N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET; HPLC external standard) and the resulting solution analyzed by HPLC for MTSO (methyl-p-tolyl sulfoxide), the stoichiometric oxidation product produced by reaction of MTS with peracetic acid. A control reaction was run in the absence of added extract protein or triacetin to determine the rate of oxidation of MTS in the assay mixture by hydrogen peroxide, for correction of the rate of peracetic acid production for background MTS oxidation.

Reactions (10-mL total volume) to measure peracid hydrolysis specific activity were run at 25[deg.] C. in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.2) containing peracetic acid (26.3 mM, 2000 ppm) and one of the following acetyl xylan esterase variants: T. maritima F24I/S35T/Q179L/N275D/C277S/S308G/F317S perhydrolase (SEQ ID NO:10) (10 [mu]g/mL of heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli KLP18/pSW202/F24I/S35T/Q179L/N275D/C277S/S308G/F317S), T. maritima N275D/C277S perhydrolase (SEQ ID NO:14) (25 [mu]g/mL of heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli KLP18/pSW202/N275D/C277S), T. maritima C277S/F317S perhydrolase (SEQ ID NO:18) (25 [mu]g/mL of heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli KLP18/pSW202/C277S/F317S), T. maritima S35T/C277S perhydrolase (SEQ ID NO:22) (25 [mu]g/mL of heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli KLP18/pSW202/S35T/C277S), T. maritima Q179L/C277S perhydrolase (SEQ ID NO:26) (25 [mu]g/mL of heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli KLP18/pSW202/Q179L/C277S (all prepared as described in Example 12). Reactions were stirred for only the first 30 seconds of reaction to initially mix the reactants and enzyme. A sample from each of the reaction mixtures described above was withdrawn after the first minute of each reaction, and every two minutes thereafter for fifteen minutes, and each sample was analyzed for peracetic acid using a modification of the method described by Karst et al., supra.
Reactions were also run under identical conditions to that described immediately above using either T. maritima wild-type perhydrolase (SEQ ID NO:2) (50 [mu]g/mL of heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli KLP18/pSW202) or T. maritima C277S variant perhydrolase (SEQ ID NO:5) (10 [mu]g/mL of heat-treated extract supernatant total protein from E. coli KLP18/pSW202/C277S), where the heat-treated extract supernatant was prepared according to the procedure of Example 12. The peracid hydrolysis reaction rate and the peracid hydrolysis specific activity for hydrolysis of peracetic acid to acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide for each perhydrolase are reported in Table 6.</p><p>&lt;tb&gt;TABLE 6
