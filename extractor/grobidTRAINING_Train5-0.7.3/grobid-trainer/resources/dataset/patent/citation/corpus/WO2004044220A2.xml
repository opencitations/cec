FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to peptides and methods of inhibiting cell infection and/or virion: cell fusion by members of the Flaviviridae family. </p><p>2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] 2.1. Entry of enveloped animal viruses requires fusion between the viral membrane and a cellular membrane, either the plasma membrane or an internal membrane. Class I fusion proteins possess a"fusion peptide"at or near the amino terminus, a pair of extended a helices and, generally, a cluster of aromatic amino acids proximal to a hydrophobic transmembrane anchoring domain (Carr and Kim, 1993; Suarez et al. , 2000; Wilson, Skehel, and Wiley, 1981). </p><p>Several otherwise disparate viruses, including orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, retroviruses, arenaviruses, and filoviruses encode class I fusion proteins varying in length and sequence, but highly similar in overall structure (Gallaher, 1996; Gallaher et al. , 1989). X-ray crystallography of the E glycoprotein (E-protein) of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the genus flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family, revealed a structure for this fusion protein distinct from other fusion proteins (Rey et al. , 1995). E-protein possesses an internal fusion peptide stabilized by dicysteine linkages and three domains (I-III) comprised mostly of antiparallel P sheets. In the slightly curved rod-like configuration of the E-protein present in the virion, the fusion peptide is located at the tip of domain II, the furthest point distal from the C-terminal transmembrane anchor. Examination by Lescar and coworkers (2001) of E1, the fusion protein of the Togavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV), revealed a remarkable fit to the scaffold of TBEV E. Recently, the E-glycoprotein of dengue virus, a medically important flavivirus, was also shown to have a class II structure (Kuhn et al. , 2002). </p><p>[0004] 2.2. The Flaviviridae family consists of three genera, flaviviruses, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses. In the United States alone, 4 million people are infected with a member of the hepacivirus genus, hepatitis C virus (HCV). This is four times the number infected by HIV. </p> <p>Each year in the US, 30-50,000 new HCV infections occur, and about 15-20,000 people die. </p><p>These numbers are expected to increase dramatically. The infection is spread primarily through needle sharing among drug users, although there is some risk from accidental needle sticks, blood products before 1992, chronic blood dialysis, and frequent sexual contact. Current treatments for HCV using ribavirin and interferon cost $8,000 to $20,000 per year, and help about half of patient only partly. End stage HCV disease is the most frequent indication for liver transplants and this costs $250,000 to $300,000. Better drugs to treat HCV infection and an effective vaccine to prevent HCV infection are urgently needed. Members of the flavivirus genus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus, cause important human diseases world-wide. Pestiviruses, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus and border disease virus, cause significant veterinary illnesses. </p><p>3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] Based on sequence similarities, it is likely that the E glycoproteins of other members of the flavivirus genus within the family Flaviviridae, including West Nile virus, are also class II fusion proteins. Analyses presented herein indicate that glycoproteins of viruses from members of the other two genera of the Flaviviridae family, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses, have previously undescribed structures. The envelope glycoprotein El of hepatitis C virus, a hepacivirus, and the envelope glycoprotein E2 of pestiviruses have novel structures, resembling a truncated version of a class II fusion protein. No viral protein has previously been identified with this structure. Our observations were unexpected and contrast with published studies. </p><p>Hepatitis C virus encodes two envelope glycoproteins, E1 (gp35) and E2 (gp70), both with Cterminal transmembrane anchor domains. Prior studies indicated that another HCV protein, E2, has a class II structure. The structural determinations of the hepacivirus and pestivirus fusion proteins allow the identification of several heretofore unknown features of Flavivirus fusion proteins for drug and vaccine development. </p><p>[0006] Thus, the instant invention teaches that HCV envelope glycoprotein E1 has a previously unknown structure, a truncated class II fusion protein. This structure identifies regions of HCV El and other class II viral fusion proteins important for virus: cell fusion. This invention also teaches that peptides can be designed to inhibit viruses, including HCV and other members of the Flaviviridae family, that have fusion peptides with a class II structure. </p> <p>[0007] Structural features of Flavivirus envelope glycoproteins identified herein provide surprising guidance for the development of vaccines and/or drugs to prevent or treat Flavivirus infections. Prior to the availability of X-ray structural data (Wild, Greenwell, and Matthews, 1993; Wild et al., 1994), several potent HIV-1 TM inhibitors were developed based on the Gallaher HIV-1 TM fusion protein model (Gallaher et al., 1989). DP178 (T20) peptide (Fig. 5A) has been shown to substantially reduce HIV-1 load in AIDS patients in preliminary results from phase III clinical trials (Hoffman-La Roche and Trimeris, 2002). Peptide drugs should be relatively easy to develop, based on our structures. Once an effective peptide inhibitor is described a non-peptide drug can be developed. </p><p>[0008] More specifically, the present invention provides for methods of inhibiting viral infection by Flaviviruses and/or fusion between the virion envelope of Flaviviruses and membranes of the target cell (the process that delivers the viral genome into the cell cytoplasm). The invention is related to the discovery, as described herein, that hepacivirus envelope glycoprotein E1 and pestivirus E2 glycoprotein have novel structures. The invention provides for methods that employ peptides or peptide derivatives to inhibit Flavivirus : cell fusion. The present invention provides for methods of treatment and prophylaxis of diseases induced by Flaviviruses. </p><p>[0009] Various embodiments of the instant invention provide for pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more peptides selected from one or more of the following groups. </p><p>A) Peptides having the sequence of any of SEQ ID NO: 1 to SEQ ID NO : 36; B) Peptides homologous to any one of SEQ ID NO: 1 to SEQ ID NO : 36, except that they are from a different flavivirus. </p><p>C) Peptides that are functionally equivalent to any one of SEQ ID NO : 1 to SEQ ID NO : 36, wherein the functionally equivalent peptide is identical to at least one of SEQ ID NO : 1 to SEQ ID NO : 36 except that one or more amino acid residues has been substituted with a homologous amino acid, resulting in a functionally silent change, or one or more amino acids has been deleted. </p><p>[0010] Various aspects of this embodiment of the invention provide for compositions that comprise one or more peptides selected from the following. </p> <p>A) Peptides having the amino acid sequence one or more of SEQ ID NO : 1 to SEQ ID NO : 36, wherein the N-terminal"Xaa"is an amino group and the C-terminal"Xaa"is a carboxyl group. </p><p>B) Peptides having the sequence of any of SEQ ID NO : 1 to SEQ ID NO : 36, wherein the N-terminal"Xaa"is not an amino group and/or the C-terminal"Xaa"is not a carboxyl group, wherein the N-terminal"Xaa"is selected from the group consisting of an acetyl group, a hydrophobic group, carbobenzoxyl group, dansyl group, a t-butyloxycarbonyl group, or a macromolecular carrier group, and/or wherein the C-terminal"Xaa"is selected from the group consisting of an amido group, a hydrophobic group, t-butyloxycarbonyl group or a macromolecular group. </p><p>C) Peptides having the sequence of any of SEQ ID NO : 1 to SEQ ID NO : 36 except that at least one bond linking adjacent amino acid residues is a non-peptide bond. </p><p>D) Peptides having the sequence of any of SEQ ID NO : 1 to SEQ ID NO : 36, except that at least one amino acid residue is in the D-isomer configuration. </p><p>E) Peptides as in groups"A) "or"B)"except that at least one amino acid has been substituted for by a different amino acid (whether a conservative or non-conservative change). </p><p>F) Peptides that are a functional fragment of a peptide as set out in any of groups"A)"to "E) ", above, where the peptides have at least 3 contiguous nucleotides of any one of SEQ ID NO : 1 to SEQ ID NO : 36. </p><p> [0011] The instant invention also provides for substantially purified antibodies that specifically react with one or more of the peptides described above. </p><p>[0012] The instant invention also provides for methods for treating or preventing viral infections in an animal where the method comprises administering to an animal or human peptides and/or antibodies as described above. </p><p> [0013] 3.1.

EXAMPLE : HEPATITIS C VIRUS E1 IS A TRUNCATED CLASS II FUSION PROTEIN. </p><p>[0039] Proteomics computational tools were used to fit HCV E1 protein to the scaffold of TBEV E, the prototypic class II fusion protein. Because HCV E1 is shorter than TBEV E, we reasoned that the former might contain several"deletions"relative to the latter. The HCV E1 fusion peptide (Flint et al. , 1999) was assumed to be located at the end of the molecule furthest from the carboxyl terminal (C-terminal) transmembrane anchor domain, and, like other class II fusion proteins to be comprised mostly of antiparallel (3-sheets. This latter assumption was supported by Chou-Fasman (Chou and Fasman, 1974) and Robson-Garnier (Biou et al. , 1988) analyses, the most commonly applied secondary structure prediction algorithms. </p><p>[0040] The fusion peptide of HCV (amino acids [aa] 272 to 281 of the full-length polyprotein) was aligned with the fusion peptide of TBEV E (aa 385-396) (Fig. 1A). Both TBEV E and HCV E1 fusion peptides have cysteine residues at either end and contain a core of mostly aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids (Fig 1A). Another domain readily identifiable in HCV E1 is the transmembrane domain. Amino acids 361 to 381 of the hydrophobic sequence near the carboxyl terminus of E1 were predicted to form a transmembrane helix by TMpred (transmembrane prediction software, see ch.embnet.org) (TMpred scroe 1308, &gt; 500 is statistically significant). </p><p>[0041] Several regions of predicted # sheets and &amp;alpha; helices in HCV E1 showed similarities to sequences known to assume those secondary structures in TBEV E (Fig. 1A). Beginning from the amino terminus, the first similarity of HCV E1 begins in (3 sheet Do of TBEV E and extends through the fusion peptide. PRSS3, a sequence alignment algorithm, was used to confirm that there is a significant similarity (p &lt; 0.025) between amino acids 246-281 of HCV El and amino acids 350-396 of TBEV E (Fig. 1B). The fusion peptide is flanked by  sheets in class II fusion proteins and predicted  sheets with similarities to the b and c  sheets of TBEV E are indeed predicted to be present on either side of the putative HCV E1 fusion peptide by Chou-Fasman and Robson-Garnier analysis. HCV E1 also has an extended region of similarity with the amino acid sequence between the two longest helices in TBEV E, as and aB. There is a statistically significant (P &lt; 0. 025) alignment of amino acids 316-356 of HCV El with amino acids 496-544 of TBEV E (Fig. 1B). </p><p>[0042] To determine the plausibility of these alignments, a three-dimensional model of HCV E1 was scaffolded on domain II of TBEV E (Fig. 2A). Similar sequences/structures were drawn in </p> <p> similar locations. Reorienting the"b"sheet in E1 is the only change relative to E required to bring the eight cysteine residues into close proximity. The four dicysteines of HCV E1 potentially form a"zipper"down the center of the molecule like the three dicysteines in domain II of TBEV E (Fig. 2B). This model locates the five HCV E1 glycosylation sites so they are surface accessible. Additionally, most of the hydrophobic residues are present in a region on one side of E1 between the fusion peptide and the transmembrane anchor (see below, Fig. 5). </p><p>[0043] Each of the HCV E1 structures drawn in Fig. 2B conforms to both Chou-Fasman and Robson-Garnier predictions, with the exception of the region from"i"to"zzB". The structures designated"i"and"j"were predicted to be 3 sheets by Chou-Fasman analysis, but a helical by Robson-Garnier analysis. The structure designated"aB"was predicted to be a P sheet by Chou- Fasman analysis, but a helical by Robson-Garnier analysis. HCV E1 appears to be missing, relative to TBEV E, much of the portion of the molecule prior to the transmembrane helix (pre- anchor). This region of TBEV E follows the trypsin cleavage site at amino acid 395 used to generate that portion of the ectodomain of E examined by X-ray crystallography, and therefore, the TBEV E pre-anchor (stem) structure is uncertain. The pre-anchor of TBEV E has been predicted to form an amphipathic a helix (Allison et al. , 1999). A sequence (aa 693-721) of the pre-anchor domain in TBEV E has the characteristics of a leucine zipper, i. e. leucine or another hydrophobic amino acid in the first and fourth (a and d) positions of a seven amino acid periodicity (Fig. 1A). The pre-anchor sequence of HCV El was also predicted to be an a helix with characteristics of a"leucine zipper" (Charloteaux et al., 2002). Because of the significant amino acid sequence similarity with TBEV E, the HCV E1 secondary structures between"aA" and"aB"were depicted as in TBEV E. There are several possible alternatives to the 3D model of HCV E1 drawn in Fig. 2B, and it is possible that the secondary structures change on interaction with membranes. </p><p>[0044] In contrast to HCV E1, our analyses did not reveal any sequences of HCV E2 with significant similarity to any sequence in domains I or II of TBEV E or any other flavivirus E protein (representatives of each of the four major serogroups were examined). Most of the N- terminal half of HCV E2, which include hypervariable region 1 (HVR 1), is without any sequence similarity to TBEV E. However, we detected a significant alignment (p &lt; 0.025) of the C-terminal half of HCV E2 (aa 549-726) with the region of TBEV E (aa 590-763) from domain </p> <p> III through the first of two predicted transmembrane spanning domains of TBEV E (Fig. 1, TBEV E TM1, amino acids 448-469, TMpred: 1496; TM2, amino acids 474-496, TMpred: 1962). As discussed above, the pre-anchor region of TBEV E has a sequence (aa 693-721) with features of a"leucine zipper; a similar motif (aa 675-703) is found in the HCV E2 pre-anchor (Fig. 1). In addition, the carboxyl (C) terminus of HCV E2, like that of TBEV E, contains a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that potentially could span the membrane twice. The transmembrane anchor (s) of HCV E2 (TMpred score: 1364) is interrupted by charged amino acids like TM1 of TBEV E. Thus, by sequence alignments and structural predictions there are demonstrable similarities between the C-terminal portions of HCV E2 and TBEV E. </p><p>[0045] Significant alignments of El of hepatitis GB virus (GBV-B) with HCV E1, indicate that this unclassified member of the Flaviviridae family also encodes a truncated class II fusion protein. </p><p>6.1. Materials and Methods [0046] Prototype strains of representatives of the Flaviviridae were used for sequence and structural comparisons. The strains examined include TBEV strain Neudoerfl (accession number: P14336); and the human prototype strain H (subtype la) of hepatitis C virus (P27958), Some comparisons used representatives of the major serogroups of flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus, strain JaOARS982 (P32886), yellow fever virus, strain 17D-204 (P19901), dengue virus type 2, strain PR-159/S1 (P12823), and West Nile virus, strain NY 2000crow3356 (AF404756). We also compared HCV sequences to those of GB virus-B virus (AAC54059), an unassigned member of the Flaviviridae. </p><p>[0047] NLKCMOLLYO, protein analysis software (Soft Gene GmbH, Berlin), was used to locate areas of limited sequence similarity and to perform Chou-Fasman and Robson-Garnier analyses. </p><p>PRSS3, a program derived from rdf2 (Pearson and Lipman, 1988), which uses the SmithWaterman sequence alignment algorithm (Smith and Waterman, 1981), was used to determine the significance of protein alignments. PRSS3 is part of the FASTA package of sequence analysis programs available by anonymous ftp from ftp. virginia. edu. Default settings for PRSS3 were used, including the blosum50 scoring matrix, gap opening penalty of 12, and gap extension penalty of 2. The alignments presented are those that produced the highest alignment scores, rather than the longest sequences that produced significant scores. Chou-Fasman and Robson- </p> <p> Garnier algorithms predict protein structures in an aqueous environment, but they cannot predict protein structures in a lipid bilayer. Domains with significant propensity to form transmembrane helices were identified with TMpred (ExPASy, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics). TMpred is based on a statistical analysis of TMbase, a database of naturally occurring transmembrane glycoproteins (Hofmann and Stoffel, 1993). RasMac, developed by Roger Sayle, was used to render 3D models of TBEV E. </p><p>6.2. Results and Discussion [0048] The results indicate that the ectodomain of hepaciviruses is a truncated version of the class II fusion protein structure. The ectodomain of HCV E1 is roughly equivalent to the part of TBEV E from the"hinge"region to the fusion peptide (Fig. 2). Our conclusions contrast with those of Yagnik et al. (2000), who predicted that HCV E2 fits the scaffold of a complete class II fusion protein. These models were not previously described. Yagnik et al. (2000), taught that HCV E2 fits the scaffold of a complete class II fusion protein. Lescar and co-workers (2001) stated that their structural determinations of SFV E1, which established the existence of a second class of fusion proteins, "indeed support the proposed model of the hepatitis C virus envelope protein E2 which was based on the 3D structure of the flavivirus envelope protein E."In contrast our model indicated that HCV El is class II although not similar to that previously described. Although there are sequence and structural similarities between HCV E2 and TBEV E, these similarities are limited to the C-terminal portions of these proteins, and are different than those proposed previously (Yagnik et al. , 2000). </p><p>7. EXAMPLE : PESTIVIRUS E2 IS A TRUNCATED CLASS II FUSION PROTEIN. </p><p>[0049] To provide additional evidence for the HCV El class II fusion protein model, we determined whether the fusion proteins of the third Flaviviridae genus, pestiviruses, might share structural/sequential similarities with fusion proteins of members of the flavivirus and hepacivirus genera. Pestiviruses encode three envelope glycoproteins, Ems, E1 and E2. Ems, a secreted protein with RNAse activity, does not have a hydrophobic transmembrane anchor domain. Ems does possess a C-terminal charged amphipathic segment that can mediate translocation of Ems across bilayer membranes (Langedijk, 2002). Pestivirus El and E2 both have C-terminal hydrophobic domains that could function as transmembrane anchors. </p><p>Therefore, we postulated that either pestivirus E1 or E2 must be the pestivirus fusion protein. </p> <p>[0050] A putative fusion peptide (aa 818-828) is present in CSFV E2, containing a consensus sequence with aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids located between two cysteine residues (Fig. 1). The cysteine residues as well as the sequences in between are highly conserved among pestiviruses, as is true of fusion peptides from other enveloped RNA viruses of class I and II (not shown). Although statistically significant alignments were not detected between the N-terminus of CSFV E2 and TBEV E (or between other flaviviruses), a significant alignment (p &lt; 0.01) was detected between CSFV E2 (aa 792-835) and HCV E1 (aa 253-294) in this region (Fig. 1B). </p><p>Furthermore, sequences flanking the putative fusion peptide were predicted to form  sheets by both Chou-Fasman and Robson-Garnier analyses (supplemental data). A significant alignment (p &lt; 0.05) between CSFV E2 (aa 841-913) and HCV E1 (aa 301-383) was also determined. By extension, the central portion of CSFV E2 is predicted to structurally resemble domain II of TBEV E. A significant alignment (p &lt; 0.005) was detected between amino acids 914-1018 of CSFV E2 and a sequence in domain III of TBEV E (aa 587-685) (Fig. 1B). There was also a significant similarity (p &lt; 0.005) of this region of CSFV E2 (aa 914-1123) with a sequence (aa 549-743) in the region of HCV E2 that aligns with TBEV domain III. In addition, TMpred confirmed that the hydrophobic C-terminal domain of CSFV E2 has a high propensity to span the lipid bilayer (score: 1137). Like the transmembrane domains of HCV E1/E2 and TBEV TM1, the putative transmembrane anchor of CSFV E2 has a central positive charge. </p><p>[0051] On the basis of the regions of significant sequence similarities between CSFV E2, HCV E1/E2 and TBEV E, coupled with the internal location of a possible fusion peptide, we conclude that relative to TBEV E, CSFV E2 is lacking a portion of domain I including segments corresponding to  sheets Eo through Io. CSFV E2 also appears to contain a somewhat shorter segment relative to TBEV E in the pre-anchor domain, i. e. the sequence between the alignment with TBEV E domain III and the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1B). No leucine zipper is evident in the pre-anchor of CSFV E2. A three dimensional model of CSFV E2 (Fig. 2C) confirms that the alignment in Figure 1 is plausible. Each of the cysteine residues is in proximity to other cysteine residues and potentially form dicysteine bridges. Like HCV E1, CSFV E2 conforms to the structure of a truncated class II fusion protein, albeit with fewer truncations relative to flavivirus E than HCV El. Because E2 is conserved among the pestivirus genus, the similarities of CSFV E2 with TBEV E extend to other pestiviruses. </p> <p>[0052] None of the El envelope glycoproteins of any pestivirus bear any significant sequence similarities to any sequenced flavivirus E protein. Immature flavivirus virions contain a precursor, prM, to the small membrane protein M. prM is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum by furin or by a furin-like protease during virus release to produce the mature M protein localized on the surface of flavivirus virions (Stadler et al. , 1997). A sequence (amino acids 173- 256) of CSFV E1 has similarity (p=0.030) to amino acids 583-654 of TBEV prM (Fig. 3A). </p><p>CSFV El does not contain the sequence RXR/KR (SEQ ID NO : 37), the furin consensus cleavage site. CSFV E1 also does not contain an identifiable fusion peptide, although TMpred predicts a significant transmembrane spanning domain in the first third of CSFV El. Like the transmembrane domains of TBEV E, HCV E1 and E2 and CSFV E2, and TBEV prM (TMpred score=1828), the C-terminus of CSFV E1 is predicted to form a membrane spanning domain (TMpred score=1884) with a central positive charge. </p><p>7.1. Materials And Methods [0053] The Alfort 187 strain of classical swine fever virus, aka hog cholera virus (CAA61161) was used as the prototype of the pestivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae. Type species of other pestiviruses, including bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) genotype 1, aka pestivirus type 1, strain NADL (CAB91847) and border disease virus strain BD31 (AAB37578), were used in other comparisons. Proteomics computational methods were as described in 6.1. </p><p>7.2. Results And Discussion [0054] Pestivirus E2 proteins are truncated class II fusion proteins, although with fewer truncations relative to flavivirus E than hepacivirus El. </p><p>8. EXAMPLE: GENE ORDER OF FLAVIVIRIDAE GENOMES [0055] Genes that encode proteins with similar functions may be present in similar locations in genomes of different members of the Flaviviridae family. The positive-polarity single-stranded RNA genomes of all members of the Flaviviridae are translated into a single large polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved by viral and cellular proteases into functional proteins. The order (from N to C terminus) of proteins in the polyproteins of TBEV and other members of the flavivirus genus is C-prM-E-nonstructurals (C: capsid), and the order of proteins in the polyproteins of hepaciviruses is C-E1-E2-p7-nonstructurals (Fig. 4). The 5'portion of the flavivirus E gene encodes the fusion peptide in domain II of the E protein, whereas the receptor </p> <p> binding domain of E is probably located in domain III encoded by the 3'portion of the E gene (Crill and Roehrig, 2001 ; Mandl et al., 2000). Fusion and receptor functions may reside in two different HCV proteins, El and E2 respectively, occurring in the same order as the domains of flavivirus E that carry out these functions (Fig. 4). Hepacivirus E1 and E2 may have arisen by insertion of a transmembrane anchor and variable domains, including hypervariable region 1 (HVR-1, Fig. 1), into the ancestral E gene. Alternatively, HCV E1 could have evolved into a separate fusion protein from an ancestral prM, with concurrent lost of the fusion peptide and fusion functions in E2. The sequence similarities between TBEV E and HCV E1 and E2, however, do not favor this latter possibility. </p><p>[0056] The order of proteins in pestivirus polyproteins is Npro-C-Erns-E1-E2-p7-nonstructurals. Pestiviruses encode two proteins, Npro and Ems, with no obvious homologs among members of the other two Flaviviridae genera. Pestivirus El and E2 are similar in sequence to flavivirus M and E, respectively. Like TBEV E, pestivirus E2 may serve both as fusion protein and receptor binding protein. These functions are carried out by TBEV E domains II and III that appear to be represented by similar structures in pestivirus E2 (Fig. 4). TBEV PrM/M functions to protect internal cellular membranes from fusion mediated by E2, and it is possible that pestivirus E1 serves the same function for E2, the fusion/receptor protein. Excepting Npro and En's, the order of structural proteins with sequence and other similarities is analogous in pestiviruses and flavivirus polyproteins. </p><p>[0057] TBEV E has two hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domains, TM1 and TM2 (Fig. </p><p>1). Hepaciviruses and pestiviruses encode a small hydrophobic peptide, "p7", which could associate with cellular or viral membranes. The cleavage that produces p7 is inefficient and delayed, and therefore much of HCV E2 and pestivirus E2 are present in the cell as uncleaved E2-p7 precursors (Harada, Tautz, and Thiel, 2000). The p7 gene is located in a similar genomic location and could have evolved from the sequence encoding the second transmembrane domain, TM2, of flavivirus E (Fig. 4). The consensus Flaviviridae genome can therefore be represented as X1-C-X2-M-fusion-binding-TMl-TM2-nonstructurals-3', where X 1 and X2 represents inserted sequences in pestiviruses, NPr and Err's, respectively, M represents flavivirus prM/Mpestivirus El and TM2 is the second transmembrane domain of flaviviruses and p7 of hepaciviruses and pestiviruses. These similarities in gene order and functions support the hypothesis that E1 is the fusion protein of HCV. </p> <p>8.1. Materials And Methods [0058] Prototype strains of representatives of the Flaviviridae as described in 6.1 and 7.1 were used for sequence comparisons. </p><p>8.2. Results And Discussion [0059] Hepaciviruses, like alphaviruses, appear to use one envelope protein for attachment (E2) and another for fusion (El). In contrast, E glycoproteins of TBEV, dengue virus, and other members of the flavivirus genus mediate both receptor binding and membrane fusion functions. </p><p> ) E2 functions as one of the pestivirus receptor-binding protein (Hulst and Moormann, 1997), and if the current analysis is correct also carries out the virion: cell fusion function. In addition to E, flaviviruses encode a membrane protein prM whose functions may include shielding of cellular membranes from the fusion peptide of E (Kuhn et al., 2002). Functions of the flavivirus small membrane protein may be vested in El of pestiviruses, which has significant sequence similarity with flavivirus prM. Mature flavivirus virions contain prM that has been cleaved to M. Unlike M, pestivirus E1 does not associate with the virion envelope as a precursor protein and lacks a furin cleavage site. </p><p> [0060] The Flavivirus fusion protein structures and functional domains described here are supported by the observations that envelope glycoproteins with significant sequence similarities, HCV El/2, TBEV E and pestivirus E2 and TBEV prM and pestivirus E1 are in analogous locations in the polyproteins encoded by the three genera of the Flaviviridae. These results suggest that members of the Flavivirus family may have a common ancestor. Divergence of the genes for the fusion proteins within the three genera of this family may have occurred either through acquisition of sequences and/or lose of sequences in a cassette manner constrained by the domain organization of class II fusion proteins. </p><p>9. Example: MEMBRANE INTERFACIAL DOMAINS IN A CLASS I FUSION PROTEIN AND HCV El. </p><p>[0061] Although the overall structures of class I and II fusion proteins are distinct, they may share structural/functional characteristics in the parts of the molecules that interact with and disrupt bilayer membranes. It is well established that class I fusion proteins have a fusion peptide at the amino terminus of the molecule that is critical for fusion (Gallaher, 1987 ; Gallaher, </p> <p> 1996; Gallaher et al. , 1989; Gallaher, DiSimone, and Buchmeier, 2001). Class II fusion proteins have an internal fusion peptide that are located after secondary structural folding at distal locations from the transmembrane anchor (Kuhn et al. , 2002; Lescar et al. , 2001; Rey et al., 1995). To provide further support for the proposed models of HCV E1 and pestivirus E2, we used another proteomics computational tool to compare other potential membrane interactive domains in the proteins with the HIV-1 transmembrane glycoprotein (TM), a class I fusion protein. Besides fusion peptides, another motif in class I fusion proteins that can be important in virus: cell fusion is an aromatic amino acid rich motif proximal to the anchor (Fig. 5A, amino acids 667-683) (Suarez et al., 2000). The pre-anchor domains of class I fusion proteins are not highly hydrophobic according to the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy prediction algorithm, however, these domains have a tendency to partition into bilayer membranes, as revealed by analyses using the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (Suarez et al. , 2000; Wimley and White, 1996). HCV El contains three domains that produce significant Wimley-White partition scores using Membrane Protein eXplorer (Jaysinghe, Hristova, and White, 2000). One of these is the transmembrane anchor (aa 361-372). The other two sequences with significant WimleyWhite partition scores are located immediately following the fusion peptide (aa 284-300) and at a location (aa 321-340) that the model in Figure 2B predicts to be near the bilayer membrane (Fig. </p><p> 5B). </p><p>9.1. Materials And Methods [0062] Sequences with a propensity to partition into the lipid bilayer were identified with Membrane Protein eXplorer from the Stephen White laboratory (Jaysinghe, Hristova, and White, 2000) using default settings. </p><p>9.2. Results And Discussion [0063] These two HCV E1 domains, in conjunction with the fusion peptide and the transmembrane anchor, potentially form a continuous track of membrane interactive regions that could channel the movement of lipids during virion: cell fusion. These Wimley-White partition analyses thus provide additional support for the proposal that El is the fusion protein of HCV. </p> <p>10. Example: IDENTIFICATION OF PEPTIDES THAT INHIBIT FUSION/INFECTIVITY MEDIATED BY HCV ENVELOPE PROTEINS. </p><p>[0064] The membrane fusogenic envelope glycoproteins of Flaviviruses share several common structural features, including"fusion peptides"and globular domain structures consisting mostly of antiparallel (3 sheets. Furthermore, the E1 protein of HCV and the E proteins of DEN, WNV and YFV each have several motifs with a high propensity to interact with bilayer membranes as revealed by algorithms employing the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale. These structural features and membrane interfacial motifs are presumably important in Flavivirus fusion, entry and infection and may represent targets to develop peptide drugs against Flavivirus infection. </p><p>10.1. Materials And Methods [0065] To overcome the lack of a conventional cell culture system for the propagation of HCV, infectious pseudotype viruses expressing HCV envelope glycoproteins have been generated (Hsu et al., 2003). Pseudotypes with HIV core proteins and HCV envelope proteins were generated by cotransfection of 293-T cells with equal amounts of plasmids expressing HCV El and E2 of strain H77 and the HIV envelope-defective proviral genome, pNL4.3. Luc. R-E- (Pohlmann et al., 2003). Peptides from an 18mer peptide set, overlapping by 7-10 amino acids and representing the entire amino acid sequence of E1 of HCV strain H77, were solubilized in 20% DMSO, diluted (final DMSO concentration &lt; 2%). Peptides were incubated on ice for 30 minutes with p24 antigen-normalized HCV pseudotype viral supernatants. The average concentration of peptides was ~25 1M, however, actual concentrations of some peptides in solution were 10, uM or less due to low solubility in DMSO (marked by asterisk in Table 5). Supernatants were also treated with DMSO vehicle alone or with a Mab (monoclonal antibody) to HCV E2 known to neutralize pseudotype infectivity. HCV peptides, vehicle, and anti-E2 MAb were also incubated with pseudotypes expressing murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelope proteins and HIV capsid proteins to control for cytotoxicity. Peptide treated and control HCV and MLV pseudotypes were added to cells, which were incubated at 37 C for 72 h. Cell lysates were then tested for luciferase activity as described (Hsu et al., 2003). </p> <p>10.2. Results And Discussion [0066] Four HCV E1 peptides demonstrated greater than 70% inhibition of HCV pseudotype infectivity, with one (peptide 54) reducing HCV pseudotype infectivity by &gt; 99.9% (Table 5, Fig. </p><p> 5B). Two of the peptides (66 and 70) correspond to sequences with a high propensity to interact with the surface of bilayer membranes, as determined by application of the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale. Peptide 66 also inhibited infection by the HIV (MLV) pseudotype by greater that 50% suggesting either that this peptide is a general inhibitor of viral fusion or that it is cytotoxic. The other two inhibitory peptides (54 and 74) represent sequences of HCV El predicted to"fold"over and interact with the portion of E1 displaying high Wimley- White interfacial hydrophobicity scores (Fig. 5B). The postulated folding over of these domains was marked by arrows in the original published figure (Fig. 5 of Garry and Dash, 2003, ). These results demonstrate the potential of peptides as antiHCV drugs, and indicate that similar strategies can identify peptides that inhibit fusion and infectivity of other Flaviviruses. Table 5. Identification of lead peptides that inhibit infectivity mediated by HCV envelope proteins.
