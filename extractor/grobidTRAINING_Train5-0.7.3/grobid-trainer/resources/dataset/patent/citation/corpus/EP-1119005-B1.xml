for forming a fuel assembly for a boiling water reactor and,
more particularly, to a fuel channel box resistant to
flexural deflection due to exposure to neutron irradiation,
and a method of manufacturing such a fuel channel box.</p><p num="0002">A method of uniformizing the exposure dose rates of
fuel assemblies by changing the positions of the fuel
assemblies in a reactor has been studied to prevent the
flexural deflection of fuel channel boxes due to irregular
neutron exposure dose rates. Hereinafter, flexural
deflection due to exposure to neutron irradiation will be
referred to as &quot;irradiated bow&quot;. However, irradiated bow
has not been prevented yet. Irradiated bow reduces a space
for the movement of a control rod and changes fission
reactivity. Thus, irradiated bow is a principal factor
that shortens the life of the fuel channel box.</p><p num="0003">Techniques for randomizing the orientations of
crystal grains to prevent irradiated bow are disclosed in
<ref typ="patent">Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. Sho 59-229475, Sho 62-200286, 
Hei 5-17837, Hei 5-80170 and Hei 9-249927</ref> (corresponding to <ref typ="patent">EP-A-0 795 618</ref>.</p><p num="0004">The technique disclosed in <ref typ="patent">Japanese Patent Laid-open
No. Hei 9-249927</ref> and <ref typ="patent">EP-A-0 795 618</ref> restrains the upper and the lower end of a
heating coil from movement in all lateral directions by
rollers so that clearance between the heating coil and a
fuel channel box may not change, and heats the fuel channel
box uniformly over the entire width of the
walls of the fuel channel box.</p><p num="0005">However, the fuel channel' box is a welded structure
originally warped and twisted with respect to a
longitudinal direction within tolerances. Therefore, the
clearance between the heating coil and the fuel channel box
changes, causing temperature difference between the
. opposite walls of the fuel channel box. The temperature
difference between the opposite walls causes difference in
orientation (FL value) with respect to the longitudinal
direction (rolling direction) between the opposite walls,
which results in flexural deflection.</p><p num="0006">A method of reducing the orientation difference ΔFL
between the orientations of the opposite walls subjects the
fuel channel box to heat treatment a plurality of times,
which, however, reduces production efficiency.</p><p num="0007"><ref typ="patent">Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Sho 59-16956</ref> and <ref typ="patent">U.S.

direction.</p><p num="0008">In particular, one pair of adjacent walls is heated to a
temperature of 1040° C and another pair of adjacent walls is
heated to 870°C. In use, the wall pair heated to higher temperatures
is less susceptible to irradiation induced expansion
than the other wall pair heated to lower temperatures.
Thus, bowing will occur in a particular direction which is
set so as to point away from a control rod.</p><p num="0009">A fuel channel box of a specific structure is disclosed

a fuel channel box that is not subject to significant
irradiated bow even if a bow is produced therein originally

high production efficiency, and a method of manufacturing
such a fuel channel box.

Zr alloy is controlled so that temperature difference

be described with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 is a
flow chart of a method of manufacturing a fuel channel box
(hereinafter referred to simply as &quot;channel box&quot;) according
to the present invention. Referring to Fig. 1, sheets of a
Zr alloy are bent by press work to form channels of a
U-shaped cross section in step S1. The edges of flanges of
the channels are welded together by butt welding in step S2
to form a square pipe.</p><p num="0016">In step S3, the square pipe is subjected to a heat
treatment (beta-quench treatment) to improve the corrosion
resistance of the square pipe. Processing conditions for
the heat treatment are, for example, heating temperature:
1100°C and holding time: 10 s. The square pipe processed
by the beta-quench treatment of the foregoing processing
conditions has an FL value of about 0.333 and the
orientation of texture is perfectly random. Under those
processing conditions, a heating coil is moved and the
distance between the heating coil and the channel box
(hereinafter referred to as &quot;heating distance&quot;) is
controlled so as to reduce the temperature difference
between the opposite walls of the channel box.</p><p num="0017">In step S4, the square pipe is subjected to a sizing
process to improve the dimensional accuracy of the square 
pipe and to cut the square pipe in a fixed length
corresponding to that of a channel box. In step S5, the
square pipe is subjected to a finishing process that
attaches clips 1b and 1c and channel spacers 1d to a
channel box body la, i.e., the square pipe. Fig. 2 shows
the channel box finished by step S5.</p><p num="0018">Referring to Fig. 3 showing a fuel channel box
hardening apparatus employed in step S3 of the fuel channel
box manufacturing method. The fuel channel box hardening
apparatus comprises a heating coil (high-frequency
induction coil) 2, nozzles 3, a coil moving device 5, a
linear roller guide 6, noncontact thermometers 8, a power
supply unit 9, a cooling water supply device 10 and a
controller 11.</p><p num="0019">The linear roller guide 6 moves the channel box 1
continuously in a longitudinal direction, i.e., an axial
direction vertical as viewed in Fig. 3. The controller 11
controls a drive motor 12 to control the rotating speed of
the threaded rod of a ball screw 7 so that the channel box
1 is moved longitudinally at a substantially constant
moving speed. The moving speed is low enough for heating
the channel box 1 by the heating coil 2 for the sufficient
beta-quench treatment of the channel box 1. Thus, the
substantially entire length of the channel box 1 is treated 
by the beta-quench treatment.</p><p num="0020">The heating coil 2 has a substantially square cross
section and heats the channel box 1 of the Zr alloy for
beta-quench treatment. The coil moving device 5 moves the
heating coil 2 in a plane perpendicular to the center axis
of the channel box 1. The power supply unit 9 supplies
power to the heating coil 2 and the coil moving device 5.
The controller 11 controls the channel box moving speed of
the linear roller guide 6 and the high-frequency power
supplied by the power supply unit 9 to the heating coil 2
so that channel box 1 is heated at a heating temperature of
1100°C and is held at the heating temperature for a holding
time of 10 s for the beta-quench treatment.</p><p num="0021">The noncontact thermometers 8 are disposed opposite
to the four walls of the channel box 1 to measure the
temperatures of the four walls, respectively. The
noncontact thermometers 8 measure the temperatures of
portions of surfaces of the walls corresponding to the
heating coil 2 (heated surfaces), respectively. The
controller 11 controls the high-frequency power supplied by
the power supply unit 9 to the heating coil 2 on the basis
of temperatures measured by the noncontact thermometers 8
so that the heated surfaces are heated at the heating
temperature (1100°C). The controller 11 calculates the 
temperature difference between the opposite walls of the
channel box 1 by using the temperatures measured by the
noncontact thermometers 8 and controls the coil moving
device 5 to adjust the heating distance so that the
temperature distance is reduced to a minimum, which will be
described later. Practically, the irradiated bow of the
channel box 1 is small when the temperature difference is
50°C or below. Thus, the channel box 1 is substantially
uniformly heated for the beta-quench treatment.</p><p num="0022">The cooling water supply device 10 supplies cooling
water to the nozzle 3 to jet the cooling water through the
nozzles 3 against the channel box 1. The nozzles 3 are
disposed opposite to the four walls of the channel box 1,
respectively, to cool the beta-quench-treated surfaces of
the walls of the channel box 1 with the cooling water. The
controller 11 controls the cooling water supply device to
adjust the flow of the cooling water jetted through the
nozzles 3 so that the walls of the channel box 1 are cooled
at a temperature dropping rate in the range of 100 to
250°C/s. Preferably, the temperature of the cooling water
is in the range of 40 to 90°C to prevent the excessively
rapid cooling of the channel box 1. Desirably, the cooling
water is jetted through the nozzles 3 at equal flow rates.
Thus, the beta-quench-treated channel box 1 is cooled 
substantially uniformly. The entire length of the heated
walls of the channel box 1 can be sufficiently cooled by
moving the channel box 1 longitudinally.</p><p num="0023">A method of controlling the heating distance to be
executed in step S3 of the method shown in Fig. 1 will be
described with reference to Figs. 4 and 5. Fig. 4 is a
flow chart of the heating distance control method and Figs.
5A, 5B and 5C are views showing the positional relation
between the heating coil 2 and the fuel channel box 1.</p><p num="0024">If the channel box 1 has a deflection or a twist
with respect to a longitudinal direction, the heating
distance varies irregularly when the channel box 1 is moved
longitudinally by the linear roller guide 6 and,
consequently, the opposite walls of the channel box 1 are
heated at different temperatures, respectively. In a state
shown in Fig. 5A, the heating distance on the front side
(the lower side as viewed in Fig. 5A) of the channel box 1
is smaller than that on the back side (the upper side as
viewed in Fig. 5A) of the same, and the heating distances
on the left right and the left side of the channel box 1
are the same. In Figs. 5A, 5B and 5C, chain lines are
center lines of the heating coil 2, a y-axis, not shown,
extends vertically and an x-axis extends horizontally.</p><p num="0025">In step S31, the temperatures of the walls of the 
channel box 1 are measured by the noncontact thermometers 8,
and the temperature differences between the opposite walls
are calculated in step S32. For example, in the state
shown in Fig. 5A, measured temperatures of the back surface
(upper surface in Fig. 5A), the front surface (lower
surface in Fig. 5A), the left surface and the right surface
are T1, T2, T3 and T4, the temperature difference between
the back and the front surface is T1 - T2, and the
temperature difference between the left and the right
surface is T3 - T4.</p><p num="0026">In step S33, a moving distance of the heating coil 2
(correction distance) is calculated on the basis of the
temperature differences. In the state shown in Fig. 5A, T1
- T2 &lt; 0 because the heating distance on the front side is
smaller than that on the back side. A y-axis displacement
Δy along the y-axis is calculated by using: Δy = k(T1 - T2),
where k is a conversion coefficient for converting
temperature difference into displacement. The heating coil
2 is moved forward (downward as viewed in Fig. 5A) when Δy
&lt; 0, and is moved backward (upward as viewed in Fig. 5A)
when Δy &gt; 0. The conversion coefficient k may be
determined on the basis of the empirically or analytically
determined relation between temperature difference and
displacement. </p><p num="0027">In the state shown in Fig. 5A, the heating distances
on the right and the left side of the channel box 1 are
equal to each other and hence T3 - T4 = 0. Therefore an x-axis
displacement Δx = 0. The heating coil is moved to the
right when Δx &lt; 0 and the same is moved to the left when Δx
&gt; 0. The x-axis displacement Δx, similarly to the y-axis
displacement Δy, may be calculated by using an expression
represented by temperature difference and a conversion
coefficient. An operation for calculating the temperature
differences in step S32 and an operation for calculating
the displacements Δy and Δx in step S33 are carried out by
the controller 11.</p><p num="0028">Suppose that k = 0 . 002 mm/°C ( 2 µm/°c) and T1 - T2
= -60°C in the state shown in Fig. 5A, a forward
displacement Δy = 120 µm. When T1 - T2 = -10° C, a forward
displacement Δy = 20 µm.</p><p num="0029">In step S34, the heating coil 2 is moved in a
horizontal plane along the y-axis by the calculated
displacement Δy and/or along the x-axis by the calculated
displacement Δx. In the state shown in Fig. 5A, the
heating coil 2 is moved only forward by the displacement Δy.
The controller 11 controls the power supplied by the power 
supply unit 9 to the coil moving device 5 to control the
movement of the heating coil 2.</p><p num="0030">The temperature differences between the opposite
walls of the channel box 1 can be reduced to the least
possible extent and the substantially entire length of the
channel box 1 can be beta-quench-treated by shifting the
heating coil 2 at a moving speed far higher than that at
which the channel box 1 is moved vertically. Consequently,
the irradiated bow of the channel box 1 is small even if
the channel box 1 has an original deflection produced
during manufacture. Since the channel box 1 can be
heat-treated by a single cycle of beta-quench treatment,
the channel box 1 can be manufactured at a high production
efficiency.</p><p num="0031">The relation between an allowable difference ΔFL
between the FL values of the opposite walls of the channel
box 1 and burnup indicating a period of use will be
explained with reference to Fig. 6. Fig. 6 shows the
results of analysis of the dependence of irradiated bow δ
of the channel box on burnup for ΔFL as a parameter. In
Fig. 6, a tolerance corresponds to a clearance between a
120 mil channel box (wall thickness: 2.98 to 3.12 mm) for
high burnup (45 to 55 GWd/t), and a control rod. When the 
irradiated bow δ is below the tolerance, the channel box
will not interfere with the movement of the control rod but
is used. The exposure bulge of the channel box is taken
into consideration in determining the tolerance.</p><p num="0032">As shown in Fig. 6, the intersection of a curve for
ΔFL = 0.012 and the tolerance line corresponds to a burnup
of 58.5 GWd/t and δ = 1.8 mm, which signifies that the
channel box can be used until burnup increases to 58.5
GWd/t when ΔFL ≤ 0.012. The intersection of a curve for
ΔFL = 0.008 and the tolerance line corresponds to a burnup
of 71 GWd/t and δ = 1.62 mm, which signifies that the
channel box can be used until burnup increases to 71 GWd/t
when ΔFL ≤ 0.008.</p><p num="0033">The relation between ΔFL between the opposite walls
of the channel box and temperature difference AT will be
described with reference to Fig. 7. Fig. 7 shows measured
values obtained through experiments and showing the
relation between ΔFL and ΔT. A channel box of a width of
about 132 mm was used in the experiments. The temperature
of a portion of each wall at about 45 mm from one end of
the wall is used as the temperature of the wall. FL values
portions of each wall at about 45 mm from the opposite ends 
of the wall were measured and the mean of the FL values was
used as the FL value of the wall. The heating temperature
was 1100°C and the holding time was 10 s. The relation
between ΔFL at the same longitudinal position (height) of
the channel box and ΔT was determined on the basis of the
measured temperatures and the FL values of the walls.</p><p num="0034">As shown in Fig. 7, ΔT = 49°C and ΔFL = 0.011 to
0.012 at the opposite longitudinal ends of the channel box
(blank circles). The temperature difference (difference in
FL) is comparatively large because the opposite ends pass
through the heating coil while the same is still being
heated to the heating temperature and while the same is
still being cooled from the heating temperature. At a
longitudinal middle portion of the channel box, ΔT = 0 to
10°C and ΔFL = 0 to 0.0075 (blank circles); that is, in the
middle portion heated at the heating temperature of 1100°C,
ΔT ≤ 10°C and ΔFL ≤ 0.0075. In Fig. 7, a solid circle
indicates a measured ΔFL = 0.0205 of a comparative example
when ΔT = 75°C. It is known that ΔFL increases with ΔT.</p><p num="0035">It is known from Figs. 6 and 7 that the channel box
can be used until burnup increases to 55 GWd/t when the
temperature difference ΔT between the opposite walls of the
channel box is 50°C or below and that the channel box can 
be used until burnup increases to 70 GWd/t when the
temperature difference ΔT between the opposite walls of the
channel box is 10°C or below.</p><p num="0036">Although the foregoing embodiment is intended to
reduce the temperature difference ΔT between the opposite
walls to a minimum, the irradiated bow of the channel box
remains small so that the channel box can be used for a
period corresponding to a high burnup of 55 GWd/t when ΔT
is 50°C or below or the channel box can be used for a long
period corresponding to a high burnup of 70 GWd/t when ΔT
is 10°C or below. Thus, the present invention extends the
life of the fuel channel box and improves the reliability
of the fuel channel box.</p><p num="0037">Although the foregoing embodiment moves only the
heating coil for the adjustment of the heating distance,
only the channel box may be used for the adjustment of the
heating distance or both the heating coil and the channel
box may be moved for the adjustment of the heating distance.</p><p num="0038">Although the processing conditions of the beta-quench
treatment are the heating temperature of 1100°C and
the holding time of 10 s, the heating temperature may be
any temperature in the range of 1050 to 1350°C and the
holding time may be any time in the range of 5 to 60 s. </p><p num="0039">Although the foregoing embodiment employs the
heating coil moving device for moving the heating coil in a
horizontal plane and the channel box moving device for
longitudinally moving the channel box, a mechanism for
moving the heating coil in a horizontal plane and moving
the channel box longitudinally may be used instead of the
heating coil moving device and the channel box moving
device.</p></description><claims lang="DE" status="new"><claim num="xx"><claim-text>Herstellverfahren für eine Brennelementkanalkammer, mit
