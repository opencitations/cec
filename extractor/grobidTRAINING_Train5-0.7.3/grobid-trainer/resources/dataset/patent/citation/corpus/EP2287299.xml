Such aerobic microorganisms also have a mechanism of detoxifying superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide-which may be generated from a portion of oxygen through metabolism thereof-with the aid of, for example, superoxide dismutase, catalase, or peroxidase, which enzyme eliminates the toxicity of such a reactive oxygen species.</p><p>[0003]    Lactic acid bacteria, which are known to be useful among anaerobic microorganisms, are facultative anaerobes, and are considered to have neither a respiratory chain nor catalase. However, many lactic acid bacteria can be grown even in the presence of oxygen, and exhibit oxygen resistance. Hitherto, some studies have been conducted on the oxygen resistance mechanism of lactic acid bacteria, and have shown that lactic acid bacteria have, for example, NADH oxidase or pyruvate oxidase as an oxygen-metabolizing enzyme. As has been reported, NADH oxidase is classified into two types (i.e., water-generating type and hydrogen peroxide-generating type), and water-generating NADH oxidase detoxifies oxygen by four-electron reduction to form water, whereas hydrogen peroxide-generating NADH oxidase generates hydrogen peroxide by two-electron reduction. As has also been reported, in a lactic acid bacterium such as Streptococcus mutans, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase converts hydrogen peroxide into water, and these enzymes function as a two-component peroxidase.
Some lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have, for example, superoxide dismutase, catalase, or NADH peroxidase, which eliminates superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide generated from oxygen.</p><p>[0004]    Studies have suggested that Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 exhibits enhanced resistance to oxidative stress (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) by enhancing expression of the thioredoxin reductase gene, and thus, in Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, thioredoxin reductase plays an important role in resistance to oxidative stress (Non-Patent Document 1).
In Bacteroides fragilis, which is an anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium, only a thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system is considered to be responsible for oxidation-reduction reaction of thiol/disulfide. It has been reported that when thioredoxin reductase is deleted, the bacterium cannot be grown even under anaerobic conditions without addition of a reducing agent (e.g., cysteine or dithiothreitol) (Non-Patent Document 2).
As has been reported, Escherichia coli includes therein a glutathione-glutathione reductase system and a thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system, which is essential for maintaining the intracellular environment in a reduced state, and gene-disrupted strains involved in such a system are sensitive to oxidative stress (e.g., hydrogen peroxide).</p><p>[0005]    As has been reported, growth of Lactococcus lactis is inhibited under aerobic conditions through disruption of thioredoxin reductase (Non-Patent Document 3). However, relation between growth inhibition of the bacterium and oxygen resistance thereof has not been elucidated, since growth of the bacterium under aerobic conditions is restored by addition of dithiothreitol, and the amount of cells of the bacterium after 24-hour culturing is nearly equal to that of wild-type cells of the bacterium.</p><p>[0006]    As has also been reported, a mutant strain of Streptococcus mutans obtained through knockout of both NADH oxidase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahpC) exhibits oxygen resistance, and thus the gene for another iron-binding protein is responsible for oxygen resistance (Patent Document 1). However, such a gene is not necessarily present in all microorganisms, and the mechanism of oxygen resistance has not yet been fully elucidated. As described above, a plurality of genes are responsible for oxygen resistance; i.e., it is not the case that only a single gene is responsible for imparting oxygen resistance to a microorganism. Therefore, difficulty is encountered in practically using such a gene for imparting oxygen resistance to a microorganism.</p><p>[0007]    It has been known that Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 (FERM BP-1366) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 can be well grown under aerobic conditions, and they exhibit various physiological effects on humans. However, a gene responsible for oxygen resistance has not yet been identified in these lactic acid bacteria.</p><p>Related Art Document</p><p>Patent Document</p><p>[0008]

Means for Solving the Problems</p><p>[0011]    The present inventors have conducted studies on the genomic information of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 and prepared gene-disrupted strains thereof, and as a result have found that there is a gene essential for oxygen resistance, and when such a gene is introduced into a microorganism, oxygen resistance can be imparted to or enhanced in the microorganism.</p><p>[0012]    Accordingly, the present invention provides the following. 
1) An oxygen-resistance-imparting gene encoding a protein selected from among the following proteins (a) to (c): 
(a) a protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or 6;
(b) a protein which has an amino acid sequence equivalent to the amino acid sequence of (a), except that one to several amino acid residues are deleted, substituted, or added, and which exhibits oxygen-resistance-imparting activity; and
(c) a protein which has an amino acid sequence having an identity of 85% or higher to the amino acid sequence of (a), and which exhibits oxygen-resistance-imparting activity.
2) An oxygen-resistance-imparting gene having a polynucleotide selected from among the following polynucleotides (d) to (f): 
(d) a polynucleotide having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 5;
(e) a polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, with a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence of (d), and which encodes a protein exhibiting oxygen-resistance-imparting activity; and
(f) a polynucleotide which has a nucleotide sequence having an identity of 75% or higher to the nucleotide sequence of (d), and which encodes a protein exhibiting oxygen-resistance-imparting activity.
3) A method for imparting oxygen resistance to or enhancing oxygen resistance in a microorganism, comprising introducing any of the aforementioned genes into the microorganism, or modifying the gene present in the microorganism.

5) A food or beverage containing the aforementioned microorganism. 
6) A drug containing the aforementioned microorganism.
7) A screening method for selecting a microorganism exhibiting oxygen resistance, comprising determining the presence or absence of any of the aforementioned genes, and/or determining the level of expression of the gene.
8) A recombinant vector containing any of the aforementioned polynucleotides or a portion thereof.

10) A nucleic acid fragment which specifically hybridizes with any of the aforementioned polynucleotides.

Employment of a microorganism into which the gene of the present invention has been introduced or in which the gene has been modified realizes production of a food, beverage, or drug exhibiting oxygen resistance of interest. Since the number of living cells of the microorganism can be maintained at a high level even in the presence of oxygen, production of such a product does not require an anaerobic apparatus or an anaerobic storage container; i.e., the product can be produced at low cost. In general, the greater the number of living cells of a microorganism, the higher the physiological effects of the microorganism. Thus, the present invention enables a microorganism to effectively exhibit its physiological effects.</p><p>Brief Description of the Drawings</p><p>[0014]

J. and Pearson, W. R. 1985. Rapid and sensitive protein similarity searches. Science 227: 1435-1441</bibl> ) by use of genetic information processing software GENETYX (product of Genetyx Corporation) employing an identity analysis (search homology) program. Specifically, homology (%) is calculated through, for example, analysis of data on comparison between a known gene and a gene of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 or Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 (parameters are as follows: unit size to compare = 2, pick up location = 5).</p><p>[0016]    As used herein, the term "gene" refers to a double-stranded DNA fragment, as well as a single-stranded DNA fragment (e.g., a sense-strand or antisense-strand fragment) which forms such a double-stranded DNA fragment. No particular limitation is imposed on the length of such a DNA fragment. Examples of the polynucleotide include RNA and DNA fragments, and examples of DNA fragments include cDNA, genomic DNA, and synthetic DNA fragments.</p><p>[0017]    The oxygen-resistance-imparting gene of the present invention is a gene found in Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 or Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 and named fnr (Lactobacillus casei fnr or Lactobacillus rhamnosus fnr (may be referred to as "fnr-r")), or a gene deduced from the fnr gene. The gene of the present invention encodes a protein exhibiting oxygen-resistance-imparting activity.</p><p>[0018]    Specifically, the oxygen-resistance-imparting gene of the present invention is a gene encoding a protein selected from among the following proteins (a) to (c): 
(a) a protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or 6;
(b) a protein which has an amino acid sequence equivalent to the amino acid sequence of (a), except that one to several amino acid residues are deleted, substituted, or added, and which exhibits oxygen-resistance-imparting activity; and
(c) a protein which has an amino acid sequence having an identity of 85% or higher to the amino acid sequence of (a), and which exhibits oxygen-resistance-imparting activity.</p><p>[0019]    The protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 is a protein derived from Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029, and the protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 is a protein derived from Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103.
The amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or 6 in which one or more amino acid residues are deleted, substituted, or added encompasses an amino acid sequence obtained through deletion, substitution, or addition of one to several amino acid residues (preferably 1 to 10 amino acid residues). As used herein, "addition" encompasses addition of one to several amino acid residues to both ends of an amino acid sequence.</p><p>[0020]    As used herein, "deletion, substitution, or addition of an amino acid residue(s)" encompasses deletion, substitution, or addition of an amino acid residue(s) in a protein having an amino acid sequence of, for example, SEQ ID NO: 2, resulting from, for example, naturally occurring mutation (e.g., single nucleotide substitution) or artificial mutation (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis or mutagenic treatment). In the case of artificial deletion, substitution, or addition of an amino acid residue(s), for example, a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence of, for example, SEQ ID NO: 2 is subjected to a conventional site-directed mutagenesis, followed by expression of the polynucleotide through a customary method.
Amino acid residue substitution may be, for example, substitution by an amino acid residue exhibiting properties (e.g., hydrophobicity, electric charge, pK, and conformational feature) similar to those of the original amino acid residue.</p><p>[0021]    The expression "amino acid sequence having an identity of 85% or higher to the amino acid sequence of (a)" refers to an amino acid sequence which, upon appropriate alignment, exhibits an identity of 85% or higher (preferably 90% or higher, more preferably 95% or higher) to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or 6.
The protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 has an identity of 89.0% in amino acid sequence to the protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6.</p><p>[0022]    As used herein, the expression "impart oxygen resistance" refers to the case where oxygen resistance is imparted to a microorganism; specifically, a microorganism is rendered capable of growing even in the presence of oxygen, and/or a grown microorganism is not killed even in the presence of oxygen. Also, the expression "impart oxygen resistance" encompasses the case where the oxygen-resistance-imparted microorganism has the ability to eliminate oxygen, the ability to eliminate reactive oxygen species generated from oxygen, the ability to change the intracellular environment from an oxidative state to a reducing state, or the ability to reduce DNA, protein, lipid, etc. which have been oxidized by oxygen or reactive oxygen species.
Specifically, the expression "impart oxygen resistance" refers to the case where when the oxygen-resistance-imparted microorganism is cultured on an agar plate medium in air, the microorganism can form colonies, or the case where the microorganism can be grown in a liquid medium in which dissolved oxygen is saturated by shaking, or in which oxygen contained in air is dissolved naturally.</p><p>[0023]    Next will be described the homology (identity) between known proteins and a protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or 6. For homology search, by use of genetic information processing software GENETYX, the amino acid sequence of a protein defined by any of the aforementioned nucleotide sequences was compared with the amino acid sequence of a protein defined generally by a disclosed nucleotide sequence of the genome or a DNA fragment of lactic acid bacteria, to thereby search for genes having homology. When the entire amino acid sequence (or a portion thereof having a maximum possible length) of a protein has a homology of 50% or higher to that of the corresponding protein, these proteins are regarded as having homology.</p><p>[0024]    The protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 (FNR) has an identity of 99.4% in amino acid sequence to a protein encoded by trxB annotated as encoding thioredoxin reductase derived from Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334 strain. The protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 (FNR-R) has an identity of 89.3% in amino acid sequence to the protein encoded by trxB.</p><p>[0025]    The oxygen-resistance-imparting gene of the present invention is preferably a gene having a polynucleotide selected from among the following polynucleotides (d) to (f): 
(d) a polynucleotide having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 5;
(e) a polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, with a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence of (d), and which encodes a protein exhibiting oxygen-resistance-imparting activity; and
(f) a polynucleotide which has a nucleotide sequence having an identity of 75% or higher to the nucleotide sequence of (d), and which encodes a protein exhibiting oxygen-resistance-imparting activity.</p><p>[0026]    The polynucleotide having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 is a DNA fragment derived from Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 (Lactobacillus casei fnr gene), and the polynucleotide having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 is a DNA fragment derived from Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 (Lactobacillus rhamnosus fnr gene (fnr-r gene)). Each of these polynucleotides imparts oxygen resistance to a microorganism, and enables the microorganism to grow in the presence of oxygen.</p><p>[0027]    As used herein, the expression "under stringent conditions" refers to, for example, the case where hybridization is carried out under conditions described in <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Molecular Cloning - a Laboratory manual 2nd edition (Sambrook, et al., 1989 )</bibl>; specifically, the case where hybridization is carried out in a solution containing 6 x SSC (composition of 1 x SSC: 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.5% SDS, 5 x Denhardt's solution, and 100 mg/mL herring sperm DNA together with a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence complementary to any of the aforementioned nucleotide sequences constantly at 65[deg.]C for 8 to 16 hours.</p><p>[0028]    The expression "nucleotide sequence having an identity of 75% or higher to the nucleotide sequence of (d)" refers to a nucleotide sequence which, upon appropriate alignment, exhibits an identity of 75% or higher (preferably 90% or higher, more preferably 95% or higher) to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 5.
The polynucleotide having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 has an identity of 75.3% in nucleotide sequence to the polynucleotide having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5.</p><p>[0029]    The gene of the present invention can be readily obtained through a customary PCR technique by using a primer set prepared on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 5, and using, as a template, DNA of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 or Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103.
Specifically, the gene of the present invention can be obtained through, for example, PCR by using a set of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides A and B (oligonucleotide A has a sequence including the N-terminal start codon of any of the aforementioned genes, and oligonucleotide B has a sequence complementary to a sequence including the stop codon of the gene), and using, as a template, DNA of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029. For effective cloning of the thus-obtained gene fragment into, for example, a plasmid vector, a sequence for restriction enzyme cleavage may be added on the 5'-end side of the oligonucleotide primer. The primer which may be employed in the present invention is generally, for example, a nucleotide chemically synthesized on the basis of information on the nucleotide sequence of the gene of the present invention, and may be the gene of the present invention which has already been obtained or a fragment thereof. Such a nucleotide has a partial nucleotide sequence corresponding to, for example, SEQ ID NO: 1 or 5, and includes, for example, 10 to 50 consecutive nucleotides (preferably 15 to 35 consecutive nucleotides).
When, for example, a DNA fragment having a length of 2,000 base pairs is prepared, PCR is carried out under the following conditions: 94[deg.]C for 2 minutes, (95[deg.]C for 10 seconds, 52[deg.]C for 10 seconds, 72[deg.]C for 2 minutes) x 30 cycles, and 72[deg.]C for 7 minutes.</p><p>[0030]    The gene of the present invention may be artificially synthesized by means of a DNA synthesizer on the basis of the corresponding nucleotide sequence.</p><p>[0031]    The gene of the present invention is a gene responsible for imparting oxygen resistance. Therefore, when the gene of the present invention is introduced into a microorganism, or when the gene present in the microorganism is modified, oxygen resistance can be imparted to the microorganism, or oxygen resistance of the microorganism can be enhanced.
The gene of the present invention may be introduced into a microorganism which does not originally have the gene. Introduction of the gene may be carried out through, for example, the competence method using DNA uptake ability, the protoplast PEG method using a protoplast, or electroporation using high-voltage pulses. Particularly, electroporation is preferably employed. Integration of the gene into the chromosome of a microorganism may be carried out through homologous recombination or site-specific integration.</p><p>[0032]    Modification of the gene of the present invention may be enhancement of expression of the gene.
Enhancement of expression of the gene of the present invention may be carried out through, for example, a method in which a recombinant plasmid carrying the gene is introduced into a microorganism of interest; a method in which the gene is integrated into another site of the chromosome through site-specific recombination, to thereby increase the number of copies of the gene in a microorganism; or a method in which the level of expression of the gene is increased by modifying a region for controlling expression of the gene or by modifying a regulatory gene. Particularly preferred is a method of increasing the number of copies of the gene. Specifically, the number of copies of the gene of interest may be increased in microbial cells through the following procedure: the gene (including the original promoter sequence and ribosome-binding site of the gene) or the polynucleotide (prepared by ligating only a polypeptide-encoding region of the gene to the downstream of a promoter and a ribosome-binding site which have been separated from another gene or chemically synthesized) is cloned into a plasmid having a plurality copies per microbial cell, and the plasmid is introduced into microbial cells through electroporation or a similar technique.</p><p>[0033]    In the case of a microorganism which originally has the gene of the present invention, expression of the gene may be inhibited or suppressed, to thereby reduce oxygen resistance of the microorganism.
For inhibition of expression of the gene of the present invention, the gene may be disrupted or deleted through the insertion-inactivation method in which a DNA fragment entirely different from a target gene is inserted into the gene, or the stepwise double crossover method in which the entirety or a portion of a target gene is deleted by stepwise homologous recombination. Particularly, the stepwise double crossover method is preferably employed.
Specifically, when the entirety or a portion of a target gene is deleted, two regions sandwiching the deletion region are separated from chromosomal DNA or separated following amplification by PCR, and the two DNA fragments are cloned into a plasmid vector (e.g., pYSSE3) which can replicate in Escherichia coli but cannot in a microorganism of interest, so that the fragments are aligned in the same direction as the original direction. Subsequently, the resultant recombinant plasmid DNA is introduced, through electroporation or a similar technique, into a microorganism in which deletion is caused to occur. Through PCR or a similar technique, there is selected, from the resultant antibiotic-resistant clones, a clone in which the plasmid has been inserted into the chromosome through recombination in a region homologous to the above-cloned region upstream or downstream of the target deletion region. The thus-obtained clone is repeatedly subcultured in a medium containing no antibiotic, to thereby select clones which have lost antibiotic resistance through removal of the plasmid from the chromosome by recombination between flanking homologous regions and through disappearance of the plasmid in bacterial growth. Through PCR or a similar technique, there can be selected, from the thus-obtained clones, a clone in which the target gene region has been deleted.</p><p>[0034]    Suppression of expression of the gene of the present invention may be carried out through the so-called RNA interference method in which a short RNA fragment complementary to the 5'-end region of mRNA of the gene is synthesized, or a method in which a regulatory gene or a region for controlling expression of the gene of the present invention is disrupted or deleted. Particularly, modification of a region for controlling expression of the gene of the present invention is preferred. Specifically, the level of transcription of the gene of the present invention into mRNA can be increased or reduced by modifying the sequence of a promoter for controlling transcription of the gene.</p><p>[0035]    No particular limitation is imposed on the microorganism into which the gene of the present invention is introduced or in which the gene is modified, and the microorganism may be, for example, a Gram-positive bacterium, a Gram-negative bacterium, or yeast. The microorganism employed is preferably a Gram-positive bacterium, particularly preferably, for example, a bacterium belonging to the genus Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium which has been shown to be biologically safe. Among bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, bacteria of the Lactobacillus casei group, such as Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus zeae, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus are preferably employed, and Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus rhamnosus is particularly preferably employed. Examples of the microorganism originally having an oxygen-resistance-imparting gene include Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (FERM BP-665), Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103. </p><p>[0036]     Bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium, which are obligate anaerobes, are labile to oxygen, low pH, or high acidity, and often encounter difficulty in handling (e.g., proliferation upon production, and survivability during storage). Since bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium exhibit physiological effects useful for humans, they have been applied to beverages, foods, or drugs by, for example, producing a mutant strain exhibiting oxygen resistance through improvement of breeding, or using an oxygen-impermeable container. However, the bacteria pose various problems, including difficult culturing, and a reduction in number of living cells during storage. Since bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium have been shown not to have the oxygen-resistance-imparting gene of the present invention, the bacteria are preferably employed as a microorganism of interest in which the gene of the present invention is introduced or modified.</p><p>[0037]    The thus-obtained microorganism into which the gene of the present invention has been introduced or in which the gene has been modified can be employed for producing a food, beverage, or drug effectively exhibiting various physiological effects that are intrinsic to the microorganism, since oxygen resistance has been imparted to the microorganism or oxygen resistance thereof has been enhanced. </p><p>[0038]     When the microorganism of the present invention in which the gene of the present invention has been introduced or modified is incorporated into a food or beverage or in a drug, living cells, heated cells (dead cells), or lyophilized cells of the microorganism may be employed. Alternatively, a cultured product containing the microorganism may be employed, or processed cells of the microorganism may be employed. Preferably, living cells of the microorganism are employed.</p><p>[0039]    When the microorganism of the present invention is employed in a drug, the microorganism may be mixed with a solid or liquid pharmaceutical nontoxic carrier, and the mixture may be administered in the form of a conventional drug product. Examples of such a drug product include solid products such as tablet, granules, powder, and capsule; liquid products such as solution, suspension, and emulsion; and lyophilized products. Such a drug product may be prepared through a customary technique for drug production. Examples of the aforementioned pharmaceutical nontoxic carrier include glucose, lactose, sucrose, starch, mannitol, dextrin, fatty acid glyceride, polyethylene glycol, hydroxyethyl starch, ethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, amino acid, gelatin, albumin, water, and saline. If necessary, the drug product may appropriately contain a conventional additive such as a stabilizer, a humectant, an emulsifier, a binder, an isotonizing agent, or an excipient.</p><p>[0040]    The microorganism of the present invention in which the gene of the present invention has been introduced or modified may also be incorporated into a food or beverage in addition to the aforementioned drug product. When the microorganism is incorporated into a food or beverage, the microorganism may be employed as is, or mixed with various nutritional ingredients. The resultant food or beverage can be employed for producing a health food or food material effectively exhibiting various physiological effects that are intrinsic to the microorganism, since oxygen resistance has been imparted to the microorganism or oxygen resistance thereof has been enhanced. Specifically, when the microorganism obtained through the method of the present invention is incorporated into a food or beverage, the microorganism may be appropriately mixed with an additive which can be used in a food or beverage, and the mixture may be prepared, through conventional means, into a form suitable for edible use; for example, granules, particles, tablet, capsule, or paste. The microorganism may be added to a variety of foods; for example, processed meat products (e.g., ham and sausage), processed fish products (e.g., kamaboko and chikuwa), bread, confectionary, butter, and powdered milk. Alternatively, the microorganism may be added to beverages such as water, fruit juice, milk, refreshing beverages, and tea beverages. As used herein, the term "food or beverage" encompasses animal feeds.</p><p>[0041]    Examples of the food or beverage of the present invention include fermented foods and beverages produced by use of the microorganism of the present invention, such as fermented milk, lactic acid baceteria beverages, fermented soybean milk, fermented fruit juice, and fermented plant extract. Such a fermented food or beverage may be produced through a customary method. For example, a fermented milk product may be produced through the following procedure. Firstly, only the microorganism of the present invention is inoculated into a sterilized milk medium, or the microorganism and another microorganism are simultaneously inoculated into the medium, followed by culturing, and the cultured product is homogenized to thereby yield a fermented milk base. Subsequently, a separately prepared syrup is added to and mixed with the fermented milk base, and the mixture is homogenized by means of, for example, a homogenizer, followed by addition of a flavor to the resultant mixture, to thereby yield a final product. The thus-produced fermented milk product may be in any form, such as a plain-type product containing no syrup (sweetener), a soft-type product, a fruit-flavor-type product, a solid product, or a liquid product.</p><p>[0042]    The microorganism produced through the method of the present invention exhibits high oxygen resistance.
 Therefore, when the microorganism is incorporated into a food or beverage product, since the microorganism exhibits high survivability therein, a reduction in number of living cells or an increase in rate of cell death is suppressed during storage of the product. In addition, the specification of the product is readily maintained, and the product effectively exhibits general physiological effects (e.g., regulation of intestinal functions) of a microorganism (e.g., a bacterium belonging to the genus Lactobacillus). When oxygen resistance is imparted, through the method of the present invention, to a bacterial strain belonging to the genus Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium which originally has a specific physiological effect (e.g., anticancer effect or Helicobacter pylori eradication effect), or when oxygen resistance of the bacterial strain is enhanced through the method of the present invention, the bacterial strain can be applied to various foods and beverages, and the physiological effect of the bacterial strain can be enhanced by virtue of improvement of the survivability of the bacterial strain.</p><p>[0043]    Hitherto, a container formed of an oxygen-impermeable packaging material (e.g., glass or aluminum-coated paper) has generally been used for storing a food or beverage product incorporating a bacterium belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium for the purpose of enhancing the survivability of the bacterium during storage of the product. In contrast, the bacterium belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium produced through the method of the present invention, which exhibits oxygen resistance, realizes employment, as a container material, of a resin having high oxygen permeability (e.g., polystyrene, polyethylene, or polyethylene terephthalate), since the bacterium exhibits high survivability and does not require strict anaerobic conditions. A container formed of such a resin is advantageous in that production cost can be reduced and the shape of the container can be changed freely, as compared with the case of a container formed of an oxygen-impermeable packaging material.</p><p>[0044]    The gene of the present invention can also be employed for selecting, through screening, a microorganism exhibiting oxygen resistance.
Specifically, a microorganism exhibiting oxygen resistance can be selected through screening by determining the presence or absence of the gene of the present invention, and/or determining the level of expression of the gene.
For determination of the presence or absence of the gene and/or the level of expression of the gene, the presence or absence of a target gene in a microorganism, the number of copies of the gene, or the level of expression thereof is determined through southern hybridization, DNA microarray, or RT-PCR by use of a probe or primer which can detect the gene of the present invention or mRNA derived therefrom. A microorganism of interest is selected on the basis of the presence or absence of the target gene or the level of expression of the gene.</p><p>[0045]    The recombinant vector of the present invention containing any of the polynucleotides shown in (d) to (f) or a portion (fragment) thereof can be obtained through a known technique (e.g., in vitro ligation) by use of any vector (e.g., pHY400, pSA1, or pYSSE3) having such a gene marker that can determine introduction of the vector into Escherichia coli and a microorganism of interest.</p><p>[0046]    A host microorganism containing the aforementioned recombinant vector can be obtained through a known method. Specifically, when the recombinant vector is introduced into a host microorganism, electroporation or a similar technique may be employed. When the recombinant vector is integrated into the chromosome of the microorganism, there may be employed a method in which a recombinant vector having a DNA region homologous to that of the microorganism is introduced through electroporation or a similar technique, and then the vector integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination is determined through, for example, PCR.</p><p>[0047]    The DNA array or DNA chip of the present invention containing any of the polynucleotides shown in (d) to (f) or a portion (fragment) thereof can be prepared through a known technique such as photolithography. The DNA array or the DNA chip can be employed for selecting, through screening, a microorganism which expresses the gene of the present invention.</p><p>[0048]    In order to effectively perform the aforementioned introduction of the gene of the present invention into a microorganism, modification of the gene, or screening of microorganisms, preferably, there is employed a recombinant vector containing the polynucleotide of the present invention or a portion thereof, a primer for PCR or RT-PCR containing a portion (fragment) of the polynucleotide of the present invention, a primer for PCR or RT-PCR which can amplify the polynucleotide of the present invention or a portion thereof, or a nucleic acid fragment for hybridization containing a polynucleotide which specifically hybridizes with the polynucleotide of the present invention or a portion of the polynucleotide.
The nucleic acid fragment (e.g., primer) which may be employed in the present invention is generally, for example, a nucleotide chemically synthesized on the basis of information on the nucleotide sequence of the gene of the present invention. Preferably, such a nucleotide has a partial nucleotide sequence corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 5, and includes 10 to 50 consecutive nucleotides (preferably 15 to 35 consecutive nucleotides).
The present invention will next be described in more detail by way of examples.</p><p>Examples</p><p>Example 1 Gene analysis of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 (gene extraction)</p><p>[0049]    Genes of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 having high homology to those of thioredoxin reductase were retrieved from the relevant chromosomes based on, for example, the homology to known microorganism-derived thioredoxin reductase genes. Specifically, through the Lipman-Pearson method ( <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lipman, D. J. and Pearson, W. R., 1985, Rapid and sensitive protein similarity searches, Science 227: 1435-1441</bibl> ) by use of genetic information processing software (GENETYX, product of Genetyx Corporation), all the open reading frames (ORFs) possibly encoding proteins speculated from the genomic sequence of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 were subjected to homology analysis with respect to the amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by the aforementioned respective genes. As a result, two ORFs having high homology to those of thioredoxin reductase were extracted from the genomic sequence. One of these two ORFs was found to correspond to the gene represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, and the gene exhibited 29.0% homology to the other gene (gene A) of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 having homology to thioredoxin reductase. However, the gene represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 was found not to have a CXXC motif (i.e., active center of thioredoxin reductase); i.e., the gene did not exhibit thioredoxin reductase activity. That is, the gene was found to be a gene whose functions have not yet been known. In contrast, gene A was found to have a CXXC motif, and thus considered as encoding thioredoxin reductase.</p><p>Example 2 Isolation of gene-disrupted strain of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029</p><p>[0050]    A mutant strain in which the gene represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 (fnr) was deleted was prepared through the following procedure.
There were employed, as primers, an oligonucleotide 5'-cgggatccagatggctttttcacatt-3' (SEQ ID NO: 3), which had been designed by adding a sequence including a BamHI restriction site to the 5'-end of a sequence selected from the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, and an oligonucleotide 5'-aaactgcagccaccagtataccattacg-3' (SEQ ID NO: 4), which had been designed by adding a sequence including a PstI restriction site to the 5'-end of a sequence selected from the sequence complementary to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. By use of KOD Plus DNA polymerase (product of TOYOBO, product code: KOD-201) and according to an instruction attached to the enzyme, PCR was carried out with genome DNA of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 as a template. The thus-amplified DNA fragment is a partial sequence of the fnr gene lacking both the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus. This product was mixed with an equiamount of Tris-EDTA (10 mM Tris (pH 8.0)-1 mM EDTA, hereinafter referred to as "TE") saturated phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25 : 24 : 1). After thorough vortexing, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for five minutes, to thereby separate it into two layers. The upper layer (aqueous layer) was recovered, and 3 M sodium acetate solution (pH 5.2) (1/10 amount to the aqueous layer) and 99.5% ethanol (thrice amount to the aqueous layer) were added thereto. The resultant mixture was allowed to stand at -20[deg.]C for 30 minutes or longer and then centrifuged at 4[deg.]C and 15,000 x g for 15 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and 70% ethanol was added to the precipitate for rinse. The thus-obtained mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for five minutes. Thereafter, ethanol was removed, and the precipitate was dried under vacuum.</p><p>[0051]    The precipitate was digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and PstI (products of Takara Bio Inc.) at 37[deg.]C for 20 hours in K buffer (product of Takara Bio Inc.) reaction solution (100 [micro]L). Subsequently, the aforementioned TE saturated phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol treatment (mixing with solvent to recovery of aqueous layer) was carried out twice. An aqueous layer was recovered, and 3 M sodium acetate solution (pH 5.2) (1/10 amount to the aqueous layer) and 99.5% ethanol (thrice amount to the aqueous layer) were added thereto. The resultant mixture was allowed to stand at -20[deg.]C for 30 minutes or longer, and then centrifuged at 4[deg.]C and 15,000 x g for 15 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and 70% ethanol was added to the precipitate for rinse. The thus-obtained mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for five minutes. Thereafter, ethanol was removed, and the precipitate was dried under vacuum.</p><p>[0052]    There was employed, as a plasmid vector, pYSSE3 (Fig. 1), which has a replication region for E. coli originating from plasmid pUC19 and has an erythromycin-resistant gene (which functions both in E. coli and Lactobacillus) originating from plasmid pAM[beta]1. The pYSSE3 DNA was digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and PstI (products of Takara Bio Inc.) at 37[deg.]C for 20 hours in K buffer (product of Takara Bio Inc.) reaction solution (100 [micro]L). Subsequently, a 10-fold concentrated CIP buffer (product of TOYOBO) (20 [micro]L) and water were added thereto so as to adjust the total volume to 200 [micro]L, and calf intestine phosphatase (product of TOYOBO) (3 [micro]L) was added thereto, followed by incubation at 37[deg.]C for two hours. Thereafter, the aforementioned TE saturated phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol treatment and ethanol precipitation were carried out, and the precipitate was dried under vacuum.</p><p>[0053]    The aforementioned DNA fragment consisting of an internal sequence of fnr and the plasmid vector which had been digested with the restriction enzymes were mixed each in an amount of about 0.01 to about 0.1 [micro]g, and an equivolume of Solution I of DNA ligation kit Ver. 2.1 (product of Takara Bio Inc.) was added to the mixture, followed by incubation at 16[deg.]C for 30 minutes. Thereafter, the resultant product was placed on ice.</p><p>[0054]    Next, the aforementioned reaction mixture (5 [micro]L) was added to JM109 competent cells (product of TOYOBO) (100 [micro]L), which had been placed on ice after dissolution, and the mixture was incubated for 30 minutes on ice after mild mixing. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was subjected to heat shock (42[deg.]C for 30 seconds), and then returned to ice. SOC medium (product of TOYOBO) (1 mL) was added to the cell liquid, and culturing was carried out at 37[deg.]C for one hour. The thus-cultured product was spread onto an LB agar medium (containing bacto-tryptone (10 g), bacto-yeast extract (5 g), sodium chloride (5 g), and agar (15 g) in 1 L) to which 500 [micro]g/mL erythromycin (erythromycin for injection, product of Dainabot) had been added, followed by incubation at 37[deg.]C.</p><p>[0055]    The thus-formed erythromycin-resistant colonies were grown in an LB medium to which 500 [micro]g/mL erythromycin had been added, and recombinant plasmid DNA was extracted by means of Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System (product of Promega).</p><p>[0056]    DNA transfer to Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 was carried out through the following procedure. The relevant microorganism was grown in an MRS medium (product of Difco), and a culture liquid in a logarithmic growth phase was centrifuged at 5,000 x g and 4[deg.]C for five minutes, whereby cells were collected. The cells were washed once with ice-cooled 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) and once with 10% glycerol, and the washed cells were suspended in 10% glycerol (initial Klett value of culture liquid x 2 [micro]L). The cell suspension (40 [micro]L) and the recombinant plasmid DNA solution (2 [micro]L) were mixed together, and the mixture was placed in a 2 mm-width cuvette for electroporation. Electroporation was carried out by means of Gene Pulser II (product of Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) at 1.5 kV voltage, 200 [Omega] resistance, and 25 [micro]F capacitance. An MRS medium (1 mL) was added to the thus-treated liquid, and the mixture was cultured at 37[deg.]C for one hour. Subsequently, the thus-cultured product was spread onto an MRS agar medium to which 20 [micro]g/mL erythromycin had been added, followed by incubation under anaerobic conditions (provided by means of AnaeroPack Kenki (product of Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc.)) at 37[deg.]C for two or three days.</p><p>[0057]    A portion of the thus-grown erythromycin-resistant colonies was collected and suspended in TE (50 [micro]L), and then the suspension was treated at 94[deg.]C for 2.5 minutes. A portion of the suspension was employed as a template for PCR. PCR analysis was carried out by using the following two primers: a primer selected from sequences located downstream of the fnr gene of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 chromosome; and a primer selected from sequences which are included in the plasmid vector and in the vicinity of a cloned fnr gene internal fragment. The PCR analysis revealed that the transferred plasmid was integrated into a region homologous to an fnr gene fragment included in the recombinant plasmid in the Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 chromosomal fnr gene, whereby the fnr gene was divided (disrupted). The thus-obtained clone was employed as [Delta]fnr.</p><p>Example 3 Gene analysis of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 (gene extraction)</p><p>[0058]    Genes of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 having homology to the Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 thioredoxin reductase gene (gene A) were retrieved in a manner similar to that described in Example 1. As a result, there were found a gene exhibiting 99.5% homology to gene A and considered as encoding thioredoxin reductase, as well as a gene exhibiting 29.3% homology to gene A. The latter gene exhibited 75.3% homology (in nucleotide sequence) and 89.0% homology (in amino acid sequence) to the aforementioned fnr. This gene was found to be a Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 fnr gene ortholog, and a gene which, like the case of fnr, does not have a CXXC motif specific to thioredoxin reductase (i.e., considered as not having thioredoxin reductase activity), and whose functions have not yet been known.</p><p>Example 4 Isolation of gene-disrupted strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 </p><p>[0059]    A mutant strain in which the gene represented by SEQ ID NO: 5 (fnr-r; Lactobacillus-rhamnosus-derived fnr gene) (i.e., the function-unknown gene obtained in Example 3) was deleted was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 2, except that there were employed, as primers, an oligonucleotide 5'-TATGGATCCACACTAAAACGGTCAT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 7), which had been designed by adding a sequence including a BamHI restriction site to the 5'-end of a sequence selected from the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, and an oligonucleotide 5'-ATTCTGCAGTCGGTGCCTCACC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 8), which had been designed by adding a sequence including a PstI restriction site to the 5'-end of a sequence selected from the sequence complementary to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5. PCR analysis revealed that the transferred plasmid was integrated into a region homologous to an fnr-r gene fragment included in the recombinant plasmid in the Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 chromosomal fnr-r gene, whereby the fnr-r gene was cleaved (disrupted). The thus-obtained clone was employed as [Delta]fnr-r.</p><p>Example 5 Growth of gene-disrupted strains of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 under aerobic conditions or anaerobic conditions</p><p>[0060]    For investigation of the function of the fnr gene, there were carried out, in an MRS medium, anaerobic culture (dissolved oxygen concentration: low), aerobic static culture (dissolved oxygen concentration: moderate), and aerobic shaking culture (dissolved oxygen concentration: high) of cells of the fnr gene-disrupted strain obtained in Example 2, as well as cells of a strain in which a gene possibly responsible for oxygen resistance (NADH oxidase (nox2), NADH peroxidase (npr), thioredoxin (trxA1), or alkylhydroperoxide reductase (ahpC)) had been disrupted (i.e., [Delta]nox2, [Delta]npr, [Delta]trxA1, or [Delta]ahpC). Growth of each strains was determined and compared with that of wild-type Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 strain. Each of the aforementioned oxygen-resistance-responsible-gene-disrupted strains was prepared in a manner similar to that described in Example 2.
Cells of the fnr gene-disrupted strain were precultured in an anaerobic MRS medium overnight, and cells of the other strains were precultured in an aerobic MRS medium overnight. Erythromycin was added to each of the culture media for the gene-disrupted strains other than the wild-type strain so as to attain a concentration of 20 [micro]g/mL. Each of the thus-precultured products was inoculated (1%) into an MRS medium for main culture. For anaerobic culture, a culture medium through which nitrogen had been passed was added to a test tube; the gas phase of the test tube was replaced with nitrogen gas; and the test tube was sealed with a butyl rubber stopper, followed by static culture at 37[deg.]C. For aerobic static culture, a culture medium was added to a test tube, and the test tube was sealed with a silicon rubber stopper, followed by static culture at 37[deg.]C. For aerobic shaking culture, a culture medium was added to a test tube; the test tube was sealed with a silicon rubber stopper; and culturing was carried out at 37[deg.]C while the test tube was inclined and shaken at 160 rpm. In each of the aforementioned culture processes, turbidity was measured every two hours by means of a Klett meter (product of KLETT MFG).
As a result, all the mutant strains (including the fnr gene-disrupted strain) were well grown under anaerobic conditions as in the case of the wild-type strain. Under aerobic static culture conditions, the wild-type strain and the strains [Delta]nox2, [Delta]npr, [Delta]trxA1, and [Delta]ahpC were well grown, but growth of the strain [Delta]fnr was considerably inhibited. Under aerobic shaking culture conditions, the wild-type strain and the strains [Delta]nox2 and [Delta]ahpC were well grown, but growth of the strains [Delta]npr and [Delta]trxA1 was slightly inhibited, and growth of the strain [Delta]fnr was considerably inhibited. Since growth of the strain [Delta]fnr was considerably inhibited even in the case where oxygen was present at a moderate level, the fnr gene was shown to be an oxygen-resistance-imparting gene. The above data revealed that the fnr gene greatly contributes to oxygen resistance, as compared with genes which have been conventionally known to be responsible for oxygen resistance, and that growth of the microorganism is prevented under aerobic conditions in the absence of the fnr gene.
The reason why cells of the fnr gene-disrupted strain were cultured in an anaerobic MRS medium for preparation of the precultured product is that the fnr gene-disrupted strain was not grown in an aerobic MRS medium. This fact also suggests that the fnr gene is essential for growth of the microorganism in the presence of oxygen.</p><p>Example 6 Growth of fnr-r gene-disrupted strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 under aerobic conditions or anaerobic conditions</p><p>[0061]    Cells of the fnr-r gene-disrupted strain ([Delta]fnr-r) prepared in Example 4 were spread with a platinum loop on an MRS agar plate medium to which erythromycin had been added so as to attain a concentration of 20 [micro]g/mL. For aerobic culture, cells were incubated at 37[deg.]C for three days while the medium was allowed to stand still under non-controlled conditions. For anaerobic culture, cells were incubated at 37[deg.]C for three days under anaerobic conditions provided by means of AnaeroPack Kenki (product of Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc.). As a result, the fnr-r gene-disrupted strain was grown on the MRS agar plate medium under anaerobic conditions, but no growth of the strain was observed under aerobic conditions. These data revealed that the fnr-r gene, which is an ortholog of the Lactobacillus casei fnr gene, is essential for growth of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 under aerobic conditions, and the fnr-r gene is an oxygen-resistance-imparting gene.
