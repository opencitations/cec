material. In particular, the present invention relates to a
novel photothermographic material that enables control of image
color tone and reduction of silver amount to be used by forming
dye images by heat development.</p><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0002">Methods for forming images by heat development are
described in, for example, <ref type="patent">U.S. Patent Nos. 3,152,904 and
3,457,075</ref> and <ref type="npl">D. Klosterboer, &quot;Thermally Processed Silver
Systems&quot;, Imaging Processes and Materials, Neblette, 8th ed.,
compiled by J. Sturge, V. Walworth and A. Shepp, Chapter 9, p.279,
(1989)</ref>. Such photothermographic materials comprise a reducible
non-photosensitive silver source (e.g., silver salt of an
organic acid), a photocatalyst (e.g., silver halide) in a
catalytically active amount and a reducing agent for silver,
which are usually dispersed in an organic binder matrix. While
the photosensitive materials are stable at an ordinary
temperature, when they are heated to a high temperature (e.g.,
80°C or higher) after light exposure, silver is produced through
an oxidation-reduction reaction between the reducible silver
source (which functions as an oxidizing agent) and the reducing
agent. The oxidation-reduction reaction is accelerated by
catalytic action of a latent image generated upon exposure. The
silver produced from the reaction of the reducible silver salt
in the exposed areas shows black color and provides contrast with
respect to the non-exposed areas, and thus images are formed.</p><p num="0003">A method of releasing or forming diffusible dyes imagewise
by heat development and transferring these diffusible dyes to
an image-receiving material was proposed. In this method,
either of a negative dye image and a positive dye image can be
obtained by changing the kind of dye-donating compound or the 
kind of silver halide to be used. Further details are disclosed
in <ref type="patent">U.S. Patent Nos. 4,500,626, 4,483,914, 4,503,137, 4,559,290</ref>,
<ref type="patent">Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication (Kokai, hereinafter
referred to as JP-A) 58-149046</ref>, <ref type="patent">JP-A-60-133449</ref>, <ref type="patent">JP-A-59-218443</ref>,
<ref type="patent">JP-A-61-238056</ref>, <ref type="patent">EP220746A2</ref>, <ref type="npl">Journal of Technical Disclosure
(Kokai Giho) No. 87-6199</ref> and <ref type="patent">EP210660A2</ref> and so forth.</p><p num="0004">Various methods have been proposed as for methods of
obtaining positive color images by heat development. For
example, <ref type="patent">U.S. Patent No. 4,559,290</ref> discloses a method in which
a so-called dye releasing redox compound (hereinafter also
referred to as a DRR compound) converted into a compound of
oxidized form having no dye-releasing ability is used together
with a reducing agent or a precursor thereof, so that the
reducing agent should be oxidized in proportion to the exposure
amount of silver halide by heat development, and the compound
is reduced with the remaining reducing agent not oxidized so
that diffusible dyes are released. Further, <ref type="patent">EP220746A</ref> and <ref type="npl">JIII
Journal of Technical Disclosure (Kokai Giho) No. 87-6199 (vol.
12, No. 22,)</ref> disclose color photothermographic materials using,
as a compound that releases diffusible dyes by a similar
mechanism, a compound which releases diffusible dyes by
reductive cleavage of N-X bond (X represents an oxygen atom,
a nitrogen atom or a sulfur atom).</p><p num="0005">As a method for forming dye images for photographic
materials, the method utilizing a coupling reaction of a coupler
and an oxidation product of developing agent is most commonly
used, and color photothermographic materials utilizing this
method are described in <ref type="patent">U.S. Patent Nos. 3,761,270, 4,021,240</ref>,
<ref type="patent">JP-A-59-231539</ref>, <ref type="patent">JP-A-60-128438</ref> and so forth. In the
techniques disclosed in the aforementioned patent documents,
p-sulfonamidophenol is used as a developing agent. Because,
in the photosensitive materials of coupling type, the couplers
do not show absorption in the visible region before development,
they are more favorable in view of sensitivity, as compared with
the photosensitive materials which utilize the aforementioned 
color materials, and they are considered to have an advantage
that they can be used not only as printing materials but also
as image-capturing materials.</p><p num="0006">These methods for obtaining dye images by heat development
are suitable for photothermographic materials utilizing
thermal transfer, diffusion transfer or sublimation type
thermal transfer from a photosensitive layer to an
image-receiving layer. However, for obtaining dye images as
photothermographic materials of monosheet type, they do not
always have suitable characteristics as for image-forming
temperature, image stability and color tone.</p><p num="0007">In photothermographic materials, compounds called &quot;color
tone adjusters&quot; are added to the photosensitive materials as
required, in order to improve image density (image
concentration) of silver images, silver color tone, and heat
developability.</p><p num="0008">In photothermographic materials utilizing silver salts
of an organic acid, various types of color tone adjusters can
be used. Examples of the color tone adjuster are disclosed in,
for example, <ref type="patent">JP-A-46-6077</ref>, <ref type="patent">JP-A-47-10282</ref>, <ref type="patent">JP-A-49-5019</ref>,

and color photosensitive material. For obtaining a wide range
of colors on the chromaticity diagram by using three primary

emulsion layers each having photosensitivity in a different
spectral region are used in combination. For example, there are
a combination of three layers of blue sensitive layer, green
sensitive layer and red sensitive layer, a combination of a green
sensitive layer, red sensitive layer and infrared sensitive
layer and so forth. These photosensitive layers may be provided
in various orders known in ordinary color photosensitive
materials. Further, each of these photosensitive layers may
consist of two or more layers as required. The photosensitive
material may be provided with various auxiliary layers, e.g., 
a protective layer, undercoat layer, intermediate layer,
antihalation layer, back layer and so forth. Further, various
filter dyes may also be added to the photosensitive material
in order to improve color separation property.</p><p num="0147">In the photothermographic material of the present
invention, it is sufficient that at least one photosensitive
layer is provided on the support. A typical example thereof
is a silver halide photographic material that comprises a
support having thereon at least one photosensitive layer
comprising a plurality of silver halide emulsion layers having
substantially the same spectral sensitivity but different
photosensitivities. That photosensitive layer is a unit
photosensitive layer having spectral sensitivity to any one of
blue light, green light and red light. In the case of a
multi-layer silver halide color photographic material, the unit
photosensitive layers are generally arranged so that a red
sensitive unit layer, green sensitive layer and blue sensitive
layer should be provided in this order from the support side.
However, depending on the purpose, the above arrangement order
may be reversed or a layer having different light sensitivity
may be present between layers having the same spectral
sensitivities. A non-photosensitive layer may be provided
between the aforementioned silver halide photosensitive layers,
or as an uppermost layer or as a lowermost layer. These layers
may contain the aforementioned couplers, developing agents, DIR
compounds, color mixing inhibitor, dyes and so forth. As for

decrease in sequence toward the support as mentioned in <ref type="patent">German

photosensitive materials. For the photographic material of the
present invention, various mechanisms for supplying base may be
used. For example, when a base-generating function is imparted
to the photosensitive material, a base precursor may be added
to the photosensitive material. Examples of such a base 
precursor include salts of organic acids with bases that are
decarboxylated by heat, compounds that release amines by
intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction, Lossen
rearrangement or Beckman rearrangement and so forth. Examples
thereof are mentioned in <ref type="patent">U.S. Patent Nos. 4,514,493, 4,657,848</ref>
and so forth.</p><p num="0166">In the present invention, when a reducing compound

represented by the aforementioned formulas (1) and (2), a
compound represented by the formula (2) is preferred.</p><p num="0168">The photosensitive silver halide used for the present
invention is not particularly limited as for the halogen
composition, and silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver
bromide, silver iodobromide, silver chloroiodobromide and so
forth may be used. Grain formation of the photosensitive
silver halide emulsion may be attained by the method mentioned
in <ref type="patent">JP-A-11-119374</ref>, paragraphs 0217-0224. However, the method
is not particularly limited to this method.</p><p num="0169">Examples of the form of silver halide grains include a
cubic form, octahedral form, tetradecahedral form, tabular form,
spherical form, rod-like form, potato-like form and so forth.
In particular, cubic grains and tabular grains are preferred
for the present invention. As for the characteristics of the
grain form such as aspect ratio and surface index of the grains,
they may be similar to those mentioned in <ref type="patent">JP-A-11-119374</ref>,
paragraph 0225. Further, the halide composition may have a
uniform distribution in the inner part and surface of the silver
halide grains, or the composition may change stepwise or
continuously in the grains. Silver halide grains having a
core/shell structure may also be preferably used. Core/shell
grains having preferably a double to quintuple structure, more
preferably a double to quadruple structure, may be used. A 
technique for localizing silver bromide on the surface of silver
chloride or silver chlorobromide grains may also be preferably
used.</p><p num="0170">When the photothermographic material of the present
invention is used as a photosensitive material for capturing
images, silver halide emulsion having sufficient sensitivity
for capturing images must be used.</p><p num="0171">The sensitivity of silver halide emulsion is generally
proportional to the light-receiving area of the grains as
light-receiving elements, i.e., the project area of the silver
halide grains. In the heat development process as used in the
present invention, since the development reaction amount
occurring in neighborhood of development starting points is
restricted compared with the conventional solution development
process, it is effective to increase the number of development
starting points per unit area of the photosensitive material
in order to obtain sufficient image density. To attain this,
it is effective to increase the number of silver halide grains
contained in per unit area of the photosensitive material.
However, there is simultaneously arisen a problem of increase
of the coated silver halide amount. This problem becomes
serious, in particular, when silver halide grains of a
relatively large size (about 0.4-2 µm of diameter as spheres)
having sensitivity for capturing images are used.</p><p num="0172">For this reason, it is preferable to use the so-called
tabular grains that have a small grain volume relative to the
light-receiving area. The form of tabular grains is usually
mentioned by using the so-called aspect ratio, which is obtained
by dividing diameter of a circle equivalent to a projected area
with grain thickness. Even when grains have the same
sensitivity, those having a larger aspect ratio can increase
the number of silver halide grains per unit amount of used silver,
and therefore they are more preferred.</p><p num="0173">The silver halide emulsion used for the photosensitive
material of the present invention preferably has such a grain 
composition that tabular grains having a thickness of 0.3 µm
or less, preferably 0.2 µm or less, and an aspect ratio of 2-100,
preferably 8-80, show 50% of the whole projected areas of grains.
If such silver halide emulsion is used, high sensitivity and
good graininess will be obtained with a small amount of coated
silver amount. The grain thickness is more preferably 0.15 µm
or less, most preferably 0.10 µm or less. If all of the silver
halide emulsions used for the photosensitive material are
designed to have such a thickness or smaller thickness, the
advantage of the present invention is obtained most markedly.</p><p num="0174">The aspect ratio is preferably 5 or more, more preferably
8 or more, most preferably 12 or more. When grains having a
relatively small grain size, i. e. , about 0.5 µm or less in terms
of a grain size represented with diameter of a sphere having
the same volume, are used, the grains preferably have a tabular
degree of 25 or more, which is calculated by further dividing
the aspect ratio with the grain thickness.</p><p num="0175">The techniques for using these tabular grains having a
high aspect ratio and characteristics of these tabular grains
having a high aspect ratio are disclosed in <ref type="patent">U.S. Patent Nos.
4,433,048, 4,434,226 and 4,439,520</ref>. Further, techniques
concerning the tabular grains having a grain thickness of less
than 0.07 µm and a very high aspect ratio are disclosed in <ref type="patent">U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,494,789, 5,503,970, 5,503,971 and 5,536,632</ref>,
<ref type="patent">European Patent Nos. 0699945, 0699950, 0699948, 0699944,
0701165, 0699946</ref> and so forth. In order to prepare tabular
grains having a small grain thickness and a high aspect ratio,
it is important to control parameters such as the concentration
of binder, temperature, pH, kind of excess halogen ion, ion
concentration of excess halogen ion, supply rate of reaction
solution and so forth during the nucleation. In order to
selectively grow the created tabular nuclei in the peripheral
direction, not in the direction of the thickness, it is
important to control the addition rate of a reaction solution
for growing the grains as well as to select the most suitable 
binder for the stages of from the grain formation to the growth
of grains. In this respect, gelatin having a low methionine
content and gelatin of which amino groups are modified with
phthalic acid, trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid and so forth
are advantageous.</p><p num="0176">The composition of silver halide that can be used for the
present invention is selected according to the characteristics
that should be imparted to the photosensitive silver halide.
When high sensitivity is imparted as photosensitive materials
for capturing images, it is advantageous to use silver bromide
or silver iodobromide. It is preferable to use high silver
chloride content emulsion having a silver chloride content of
50% or more, preferably and 80% or more, because it can reduce
haze of the photosensitive material after development.</p><p num="0177">In the present invention, while silver halide grains of
various shapes can be used, the grains preferably have
monodispersed grain size distribution. Silver halide emulsion
preferably used for the present invention preferably has a
variation coefficient for grain size distribution of 40% or less,
more preferably 30% or less, most preferably 20% or less.</p><p num="0178">When the silver halide grains are tabular grains, a
smaller variation coefficient for grain thickness distribution
is also preferred. This variation coefficient is preferably
40% or less, more preferably 30% or less, most preferably 20%
or less.</p><p num="0179">Silver halide grains are prepared so that they should have
various structures in grains, in addition to the devising of
the shapes thereof. A commonly used technique is a method of
constituting each grain with multiple layers with different
halogen compositions. For silver iodobromide grains used for
materials for capturing images, it is preferable to prepare
layers of different iodine contents. The so-called high iodine
content core type core/shell grains are known for the purpose
of controlling developability, in which a core having a high
iodine content is coated with a shell having a low iodine content. 
Contrary to the above, high iodine content shell type core/shell
grains are also known, which have a shell having a high iodine
content. These grains are effective for enhancing stability
of the shape, when the grain thickness of tabular grains is
reduced. There is also known a technique in which high
sensitivity is attained by covering a core having a low iodine
content with a first shell having a high iodine content and
depositing a second shell having a low iodine content thereon.
In silver halide grains prepared in such a manner, dislocation
lines are formed in the shell deposited on the high iodine
content phase (in a tabular grain, this corresponds to a fringe
portion at outer periphery of the grain) due to crystal
irregularity, and they contribute to obtaining high sensitivity.
For the deposition of the high iodine content phase, there can
be preferably used a method comprising adding a solution of
water-soluble iodide such as potassium iodide alone, or adding
it simultaneously with a solution of water-soluble silver salt
such as silver nitrate, a method comprising introducing silver
iodide microparticles into a system, a method comprising adding
a compound that releases an iodide ion upon reaction with an
alkali or a nucleophilic agent (for example, sodium
p-iodoacetamidobenzenesulfonate etc.) and so forth.</p><p num="0180">In the present invention, epitaxially grown projections
may be deposited on the surface of the aforementioned various
host grains.</p><p num="0181">In the present invention, the silver halide grains are
preferably doped with polyvalent metal ions such as transition
metal elements. Although such polyvalent metal ions can also
be introduced in the form of halide, nitrate or the like during
the grain formation, it is preferable to introduce the
polyvalent metal ions in the form of metal complex containing
the polyvalent metal ion as the center metal (halogeno complex,
ammine complex, cyano complex, nitrosyl complex etc.).</p><p num="0182">The metal complexes preferably used in the present
invention are complexes in which ligands that can significantly 
cleave d-orbital on spectral chemical series such as cyanide
ions are coordinated around a metal ion belonging to the first,
second or third transition series. It is preferred that the
coordination form of these complexes is a 6-coordinated complex
in which 6 ligands are coordinated to form an octahedron and
the number of cyane ligands among them is 4 or more.</p><p num="0183">Preferred ligands other than the cyane ligands can be
selected from inorganic ligands such as SCN, NCS and H<sub>2</sub>O and
organic ligands such as pyridine, bipyridine, phenanthroline,
imidazole and pyrazole, and used.</p><p num="0184">Examples of preferred center transition metals are iron,
cobalt, ruthenium, rhenium, osmium and iridium.</p><p num="0185">The photosensitive silver halide emulsion used in the
present invention can contain, in addition to the
aforementioned metal complexes, complexes comprising
ruthenium, rhodium, palladium or iridium carrying a halide ion
or thiocyanate ion as a ligand, complexes comprising ruthenium
having one or more nitrosyl ligands, complexes comprising
chromium having a cyanide ion ligand and so forth.</p><p num="0186">In the present invention, the silver halide grains are
preferably doped with divalent anions of so-called chalcogen
elements such as sulfur, selenium and tellurium in addition to
the aforementioned metal complexes. These dopants are also
useful for obtaining high sensitivity and improving exposure
condition dependency.</p><p num="0187">The preparation of silver halide grains used in the
present invention can be performed based on known methods, for
example, those methods described in <ref type="npl">P. Glafkides, Chimie et
Phisique Photographique, Paul Montel, 1967</ref>; <ref type="npl">G. F. Duffin,
Photographic Emulsion Chemistry, Focal Press, 1966</ref>; <ref type="npl">V. L.
Zelikman et al., Making and Coating of Photographic Emulsion,
Focal Press, 1964</ref> and so forth. That is, the preparation can
be performed in various pH regions by the acidic method, neutral
method, ammonia method and so forth. Further, the single
addition method, simultaneous addition method and so forth may 
be used alone in combination as a method for supplying reaction
solutions of water-soluble silver salt and water-soluble
halogen salt. It is also preferable to employ the controlled
double jet method in which the addition of reaction solutions
is controlled so that pAg should be maintained at a target value
during the reaction. Further, a method for maintaining pH
during the reaction at a constant value is also employed. When
the grains are formed, although the solubility of silver halide
can be controlled by varying the temperature, pH or pAg of the
system, thioethers, thioureas or rhodan salts can also be used
as a solvent. Examples of these are mentioned in, for example,
<ref type="patent">JP-B-47-11386</ref> and <ref type="patent">JP-A-53-144319</ref>.</p><p num="0188">The silver halide particle used for the present invention
is usually prepared by supplying a solution of water-soluble
silver salt such as silver nitrate and solution of water-soluble
halogen salt such as an alkali halide into an aqueous solution
of water-soluble binder such as gelatin under controlled
conditions. After the formation of the silver halide grains,
excessive water-soluble salts are preferably removed. For
this, a variety of means may be employed, which include the
noodle washing process comprising gelling a gelatin solution
containing silver halide grains, cutting the gel into strings
and then washing away the water-soluble salts from the strings
with cold water and the precipitation process comprising
coagulating the gelatin by adding to the solution an inorganic
salt comprising a polyvalent anion (e.g., sodium sulfate), an
anionic surfactant, an anionic polymer (e.g., sodium
polystyrenesulfonate) or a gelatin derivative (e.g., aliphatic
acylated gelatin, aromatic acylated gelatin, aromatic
carbamoylated gelatin etc.), and thereafter removing the excess
salts. The precipitation process is favorably used, because
the excessive salt can be rapidly removed.</p><p num="0189">In the present invention, it is normally preferable to
use silver halide emulsion subjected to chemical sensitization
comprising any of known sensitization methods each alone or as 
combination thereof. The chemical sensitization imparts high
sensitivity to the prepared silver halide grains and
contributes to impartation of stability of the silver halide
emulsion for exposure conditions and storage conditions.</p><p num="0190">As the chemical sensitization, preferably employed is
chalcogen sensitization utilizing a sulfur, selenium or
tellurium compound. As these sensitizers, there are used
compounds that release the chalcogen elements to form a silver
chalcogenide when they are added to silver halide emulsion.
Use of a combination of these sensitizers is also preferable
in view of achieving high sensitivity and reducing fog.</p><p num="0191">Noble metal sensitization utilizing gold, platinum,
iridium or the like is also preferred. In particular, gold
sensitization utilizing chloroauric acid alone or in
combination with a compound that can be a ligand of gold such
as thiocyanate ion can provide high sensitivity. A combination
of gold sensitization and chalcogen sensitization can provide
further higher sensitivity.</p><p num="0192">The so-called reductive sensitization is also preferably
used, in which reductive silver nuclei are introduced during
the grain formation by using a compound having appropriate
reducing property to obtain high sensitivity. Also preferred
is reductive sensitization in which an alkynylamine having an
aromatic ring is added to silver halide emulsion during the
chemical sensitization thereof.</p><p num="0193">When chemical sensitization is performed, it is also
preferable to control reactivity of silver halide grains by
using a compound that can be adsorbed on the silver halide grains.
It is particularly preferable to add a nitrogen-containing
heterocyclic compound or a mercapto compound, or a sensitizing
dye such as cyanine dye or merocyanine dye prior to the chalcogen
sensitization or gold sensitization.</p><p num="0194">Although the conditions for the chemical sensitization
vary depending on the purpose, the temperature is in the range
of 30-95°C, preferably in the range of 40-75°C, pH is in the 
range of 5.0-11.0, preferably in the range of 5.5-8.5, and pAg
is in the range of 6.0-10.5, preferably in the range of 6.5-9.8.</p><p num="0195">The techniques concerning chemical sensitization are

these chemical sensitization processes, it is also preferable
to form epitaxially grown projections.</p><p num="0196">In the present invention, photosensitive silver halide
emulsion is preferably subjected to the so-called spectral
sensitization, which imparts sensitivity in a desired
wavelength region to the silver halide emulsion. In particular,
color photosensitive materials comprise photosensitive layers
sensitive to blue, green and red, respectively, in order to
reproduce colors conforming to the original with high fidelity.
Such sensitivities can be imparted by spectrally sensitizing
silver halide with so-called spectral sensitizing dyes.</p><p num="0197">Examples of such dyes include cyanine dyes, merocyanine
dyes, complex cyanine dyes, complex merocyanine dyes, holopolar
cyanine dyes, hemicyanine dyes, styryl dyes, hemioxonol dyes
and so forth. Examples of these sensitizing dyes are disclosed
in, for example, <ref type="patent">U.S. Patent No. 4,617,257</ref>, <ref type="patent">JP-A-59-180550</ref>,

be used in a combination thereof. A combination of these
sensitizing dyes is used for adjustment of distribution of
spectral sensitivity as for wavelength or for
supersensitization. By using a combination of dyes exhibiting
a supersensitization effect, it is possible to obtain
sensitivity far greater than the sum of sensitivities that can
be obtained by using dyes individually.</p><p num="0199">Further, the photosensitive silver halide emulsion
preferably further contains a dye having no spectral
sensitization effect by itself or a compound which is
substantially incapable of absorbing visible light, but
exhibiting supersensitization effect. Examples of the 
compound exhibiting supersensitization effect include
diaminostilbene compounds. Examples of these compounds are
mentioned in <ref type="patent">U.S. Patent No. 3,615,641</ref>, <ref type="patent">JP-A-63-23145</ref> and so
forth.</p><p num="0200">These spectral sensitizing dyes or supersensitizing dyes
can be added to the silver halide emulsion at any stage of the
preparation of the emulsion. There are various methods
including, for examples, a method in which the addition is
performed when a coating solution is prepared from an emulsion
after the chemical sensitization thereof, a method in which the
addition is performed upon completion of the chemical
sensitization, a method in which the addition is performed
during the chemical sensitization, a method in which the
addition is performed before the chemical sensitization, a
method in which the addition is performed after the grain
formation but before desalting, a method in which the addition
is performed during the process of grain formation, a method
in which the addition is performed before grain formation and
so forth. These methods may be employed each alone, or in
combination. It is preferable to perform the addition in a
process before the chemical sensitization in view of obtaining
high sensitivity.</p><p num="0201">The amounts of the spectral sensitizing dye and
supersensitizing dye may significantly differ depending on the
form and size of the grains, and depending on the photographic

10<sup>-5</sup> to 10<sup>-2</sup> mole, per one mole of silver halide. These compounds

microscope image of organic silver salt dispersion. An example
of the method for determining monodispersibility is a method
comprising obtaining the standard deviation of a volume weight
average diameter of the organic acid silver salt. The percentage
of a value obtained by dividing the standard deviation by volume
weight average diameter (variation coefficient) is preferably
80% or less, more preferably 50% or less, particularly preferably
30% or less. As a measurement method, for example, the grain
size can be determined by irradiating organic acid silver salt

scattered light with time (volume weight average diameter). The
average grain size determined by this method is preferably from

metal salt, not a halide compound. Specifically, they are
preferably added in the form of nitrate or sulfate. Addition
of halide is not preferred, since it degrades image storability,

emulsion layer) can be selected from well known natural or
synthetic resins such as gelatin, polyvinyl acetal, polyvinyl
chloride, polyvinyl acetate, cellulose acetate, polyolefin,
polyester, polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile and polycarbonate.
Copolymers and terpolymers may also be used. Preferred
polymers are polyvinyl butyral, butyl ethyl cellulose,
methacrylate copolymer, maleic anhydride ester copolymer,
polystyrene and butadiene/styrene copolymer. Two or more of
these polymers can be used in combination, if required. The
polymers are used in an amount sufficient to hold other
components in the polymer, namely, they are used in an effective
range to function as a binder. Those skilled in the art can
appropriately determine the effective range. In order to hold
at least the organic silver salt, the ratio of the binder and
the organic silver salt may preferably range from about 15:1

present invention&quot;, and the polymer latex used for the binder
will be referred to as the &quot;polymer latex used in the present
invention&quot; hereinafter). The polymer latex may be used not 
only in the image-forming layer, but also in the protective
layer, back layer or the like. When the photothermographic
material of the present invention is used for, in particular,
printing use in which dimensional change causes problems, the
polymer latex should be used also in a protective layer and a
back layer. The term &quot;polymer latex&quot; used herein means a
dispersion comprising hydrophobic water-insoluble polymer
dispersed in a water-soluble dispersion medium as fine particles.
The dispersed state may be one in which polymer is emulsified
in a dispersion medium, one in which polymer underwent emulsion
polymerization, micelle dispersion, one in which polymer
molecules having a hydrophilic portion are dispersed in a
molecular state or the like. Polymer latex used in the present

of photographic elements during the heat development. Polymer
latex used for the protective layer or back layer preferably
has a glass transition temperature of 25-70°C, because these

consists of an organic compound (usually an organic solvent)
that lowers the minimum film forming temperature of the polymer
latex. It is explained in, for example, the aforementioned

average molecular weight of 5,000 to 1,000,000, preferably from

diatomaceous earth and so forth. The matting agent may be used
as a mixture of different substances as required. The size and
shape of the matting agent are not particularly limited and the
matting agent may have any particle size. A matting agent
having a particle size of from 0.1-30 µm may preferably used
to carry out the present invention. The matting agent may have
either a narrow or broad particle size distribution. However,
since the matting agent may greatly affect the haze or surface
gloss of the photosensitive material, the particle size, shape
and particle size distribution is preferably controlled to meet
a desired purpose at the preparation of the matting agent or
by mixing several matting agents.</p><p num="0266">The matting agent may preferably be incorporated in the
outermost surface layer or a layer which functions as the
outermost surface layer of the photosensitive material, or
alternatively, in a layer close to the outer surface or a layer
which acts as a so-called protective layer. The matting degree
on the surface protective layer for the emulsion layer can be
freely chosen so long as the star dust troubles do not occur.
The degree may preferably be within a range of 500-10,000 seconds,
most preferably 500-2,000 seconds, in terms of Beck's
smoothness.</p><p num="0267">According to the present invention, the
photothermographic material that is a single-sided
photosensitive material and has a back layer containing a matting
agent constitutes a preferred embodiment. The matting degree
of the back layer is 10-1,200 seconds, more preferably 50-700
seconds, in terms of Beck's smoothness.</p><p num="0268">The emulsion for photothermography used in the present
invention is coated on a support to form one or more layers. In
the case of a single layer, the layer must contain a silver salt 
of an organic acid, a silver halide, a developing agent, a binder,
and materials to be optionally added such as a color tone adjustor,
coating aid and other auxiliary agents. In the case of a
double-layer structure, the first emulsion layer (usually a
layer adjacent to the support) must contain a silver salt of an
organic acid and a silver halide, and the second layer or both
layers must contain some other components. However, a
double-layer structure comprising a single emulsion layer
containing all of the components and a protective topcoat may
also be contemplated. A multi-color photosensitive
photothermographic material may have a combination of the
above-mentioned two layers for each of the colors, or as mentioned
in <ref type="patent">U.S. Patent No. 4,708,928</ref>, a structure comprising a single
layer containing all components. In the case of a multi-dye

photothermographic material of the present invention. Typical
examples of the support include polyester film, undercoated
polyester film, poly(ethylene terephthalate) film, polyethylene
naphthalate film, nitrocellulose film, cellulose ester film,
poly(vinyl acetal) film, polycarbonate film, other related or
resinous material, glass, paper, metal and so forth. A flexible
substrate, particularly, a paper support coated with baryta
and/or partially acetylated α-olefin polymer, in particular,
a polymer of α-olefin having 2-10 carbon atoms, such as
polyethylene, polypropylene or ethylene/butene copolymer may
typically be used. The support may be either transparent or
opaque, and preferably be transparent. Among them, a biaxially
stretched polyethylene terephthalate (PET) having a thickness
of approximately from 75-200 µm is particularly preferred.</p><p num="0274">When a plastic film is passed through a heat development
apparatus and processed at 80°C or higher, the film generally
expands or contracts in the dimension. If the processed
materials are used as printing plates, such expansion or
contraction causes a serious problem at the time of precision
multi-color printing. Accordingly, in the present invention, 
it is preferable to use a film designed to cause little change
in the dimension by relaxing the internal strain remaining in
the film during the biaxial stretching and thereby eliminating
the heat shrinkage distortion that may be generated during the
heat development. For example, polyethylene terephthalate
heat-treated at 100-210°C before a photothermographic emulsion
is coated thereon is preferably used. A film having a high glass
transition point is also preferred, and for example, a film of
polyether ethyl ketone, polystyrene, polysulfone, polyether
sulfone, polyarylate or polycarbonate may be used.</p><p num="0275">The photothermographic material of the invention may have,

used for the heat development of the photothermographic
material of the present invention is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1
depicts a side view of a heat development apparatus. The heat
development apparatus shown in Fig. 1 comprises carrying-in
roller pairs 11 (lower rollers are heating rollers), which carry
a photothermographic material 10 into the heating section while
making the material in a flat shape and preheating it, and
carrying-out roller pairs 12, which carry out the
photothermographic material 10 after heat development from the
heating section while maintaining the material to be in a flat
shape. The photothermographic material 10 is heat-developed
while it is conveyed by the carrying-in roller pairs 11 and then
by the carrying-out roller pairs 12. A conveying means for
carrying the photothermographic material 10 under the heat
development is provided with multiple rollers 13 so that they
should be contacted with the surface of the image-forming layer
side, and a flat surface 14 adhered with non-woven fabric 
(composed of, for example, aromatic polyamide, Teflon etc.) or
the like is provided on the opposite side so that it should be
contacted with the opposite back surface. The
photothermographic material 10 is conveyed by driving of the
multiple rollers 13 contacted with the surface of the
image-forming layer side, while the back surface slides on the
flat surface 14. As heating means, heaters 15 are provided over
the rollers 13 and under the flat surface 14 so that the
photothermographic material 10 should be heated from the both
sides. Examples of the heating means include panel heaters and
so forth. While clearance between the rollers 13 and the flat
surface 14 may vary depending on the material of the flat surface
member, it is suitably adjusted to a clearance that allows the

each heater can be adjusted freely.</p><p num="0286">The heating section is constituted by a preheating section
A comprising the carrying-in roller pairs 11 and a heat
development section B comprising the heaters 15. Temperature
of the preheating section A locating upstream from the heat
development section B is preferably controlled to be lower than
the heat development temperature (for example, lower by about
10-30°C), and it is desired that temperature and heat
development time are adjusted so that they should be sufficient
for evaporating moisture contained in the photothermographic
material 10. The temperature is also preferably adjusted to 
be higher than the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the
support of the photothermographic material 10 so that uneven
development should be prevented.</p><p num="0287">Further, guide panels 16 are provided downstream from the
heat development section B, and a gradual cooling section C
