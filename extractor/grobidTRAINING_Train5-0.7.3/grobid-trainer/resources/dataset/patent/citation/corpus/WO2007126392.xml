In particular, the invention relates to analogs of hBD3, their derivatives or fragments thereof.</p><p>Background of the invention</p><p>Defensins are small 3-5 kDa cationic endogenous proteins constrained by three disulfide bonds and are primarily known for their antimicrobial activity (Raj P.A. and A.R. Dentino, 2002). Defensins have been shown to be key elements in the innate immune system of many organisms, the first line of defense against invading pathogens. They also act as chemoattractant agents for monocytes and dendritic cells in mammals (Yang et al, 2001). In humans, there are currently six [alpha]-defensins, human neutrophil peptides (hNP1 to hNP6) and four [beta]-defensins (hBD1 to hBD4).</p><p>As a class of peptides, defensins have broad anti-microbial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeast, and some enveloped viruses including HIV, although specific defensins often have defined spectra of activity (Schroder J. M., 1999). hBD3 has a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and adenovirus with hBD3 consistently being the most potent. Additionally, hBD3 has significant bactericidal activity against multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at physiological salt concentrations (David et al, 2002), and has shown activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Burkholderia cepacia and the yeast Candida albicans (Harder et al, 2001 ; Garcia et al, 2001 ).</p><p>It is generally assumed that the antimicrobial activity of defensins is determined by the existence of an amphiphilic molecular structure and the extent and distribution of cationic and hydrophobic regions on the folded peptide surface (Yeaman and Yount, 2003; Hwang and Vogel, 1998). The presence and the position of disulfide bridges and N-terminal sequence variations/fragments seem to have a marginal influence on the antibacterial effect of [beta]-defensins (Zucht et al, 1998). Only little is known about the influence of structural factors of [beta]-defensins on the interaction with eukaryotic membranes.</p><p>Selectivity of effects of antibacterial peptides including [beta]-defensins on bacterial and eukaryotic cells may be determined by the balance of positively charged and hydrophobic surface regions. Disulfide bonds in hBD3, although required for binding and activation of chemokine receptor CCR6 for chemotaxis, appear to be dispensable for its antibacterial function, and a linear structure of [Abu]- hBD3 appears to have abolished the chemotactic activity of hBD3, but the bacterial activity remained unaffected in the absence of any disulfide bond. Despite the significant progress in recent years, the structure-activity relationships for human defensins remain largely unexplored. The sequence rules and structural determinants in human defensins that govern a great variety of biological functions and mechanisms of their action continue to remain poorly understood.</p><p><bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gordon, Y. Jerold, et al (in Current Eye Research, 2005, 30, 505-15)</bibl> commented that, among disadvantages, systemic and local toxicity and high manufacturing costs are two major disadvantages for development of antimicrobial peptides as anti-infective drugs. Efforts to develop better defensins have yielded some results suggesting that it is feasible to increase the killing ability, but host cytotoxicity may also increase under these circumstances Accordingly, cytotoxicity may be considered a major challenge for ophthalmic development. Accordingly, there is a need in this field of technology of further investigation and development of effective, improved and less cytotoxic products.

The whole content of such bibliographic references is herein incorporated by reference.</p><p>In the present invention, a series of linear analogs of hBD3 were designed, and synthesised, and the influence of the overall hydrophobicity, charge distribution/density, the ratio of the positively charged surface regions to hydrophobic ones on the antibacterial activity, cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity were investigated. It was found that the linear backbone structure of hBD3 analogs with different overall hydrophobicity in presence of any disulfide bridge is a key structural determinant to decrease cytotoxicity to mammalian cells, particularly epithelial cells. This provided defensin derivative antibiotics with increased bactericidal activity and with reduced mammalian cell cytotoxicity. The present invention therefore relates to an isolated antimicrobial peptide.</p><p>According to a first aspect, the present invention provides an isolated antimicrobial peptide, wherein the peptide is a linear analog of hBD3 or a fragment thereof, provided that the analog is not SEQ ID NO:28 and the fragment is not any one of SEQ ID NOs:31 to 36.</p><p>"Peptide" as used herein refers to and encompasses any amino acid molecule, a peptide or polypeptide. The "peptide" can be obtained as a gene product, a purified and/or isolated product, an expression product, from fragmentation of protein(s) or a synthetic peptide. An "isolated peptide" encompasses naturally occurring, a gene expression product and a synthetic peptide. Peptide Production - peptide of the invention may be produced by any method known in the art. One method of producing the disclosed peptides is to link two or more amino acid residues together by protein chemistry techniques. For example, peptides are chemically synthesized using currently available laboratory equipment using either Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) or Boc (tert- butyloxycarbonoyl) chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, Calif.). A peptide can be synthesized and not cleaved from its synthesis resin, whereas the other fragment of a peptide or protein can be synthesized and subsequently cleaved from the resin, thereby exposing a terminal group, which is functionally blocked on the other fragment. By peptide condensation reactions, these two fragments can be covalently joined via a peptide bond at their carboxyl and amino termini, respectively, (<bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Grant G A (1992) Synthetic Peptides: A User Guide. W. H. Freeman and Co., N.Y. (1992)</bibl>; <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bodansky M and Trost B., Ed. (1993) Principles of Peptide Synthesis. Springer-Verlag Inc., NY</bibl>). Alternatively, the peptide is independently synthesized in vivo. Once isolated, these independent peptides may be linked to form a peptide or fragment thereof via similar peptide condensation reactions.</p><p>It is contemplated that specific modifications may be made within the peptide that maintain the peptides antimicrobial properties of the claimed sequence, but also confers some additional desirable property to the peptide. It is well known in the art that certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids in a protein structure without appreciable loss of peptide activity. Since it is the interactive capacity and nature of a peptide that defines that peptide's biological functional activity, certain amino acid sequence substitutions can be made in a sequence and nevertheless obtain a peptide with like properties. It is thus contemplated by the inventors that various changes may be made in the sequence of the isolated antimicrobial peptide, without appreciable loss of biological activity and perhaps may enhance desired activities.</p><p>The amino acid abbreviations used herein are conventional one letter codes for the amino acids and are expressed as follows: A or Ala, alanine; B, asparagine or aspartic acid; C or Cys, cysteine; D or Asp, aspartic acid; E or GIu, glutamic acid; F or Phe, phenylalanine; G or GIy, glycine; H or His, histidine; I or lie, isoleucine; K or Lys, lysine; L or Leu, leucine; M or Met, methionine; N or Asn, asparagine; P or Pro, proline; Q or GIn, glutamine; R or Arg, arginine; S or Ser, serine; T or Thr, threonine; V or VaI, valine; W or Trp, tryptophan; Y or Tyr, tyrosine; Z, glutamine or glutamic acid.</p><p>For example, in designing peptide constructs with antimicrobial properties, substitutions may be used which modulate one or more properties of the molecule. Such variants typically contain the exchange of one amino acid for another at one or more sites within the peptide. For example, certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids in a peptide structure in order to enhance the interactive binding capacity of the structures. Since it is the interactive capacity and nature of a protein that defines a protein's biological functional activity, certain amino acid substitutions can be made in a protein sequence, and its underlying DNA coding sequence which potentially create a peptide with superior characteristics. Accordingly, a particular aspect of the present invention provides that the cysteine residues of hBD3 may be replaced with any other amino acid (as listed above) or a derivative thereof, or may be replaced with a protected cysteine residue or derivative thereof, or the cysteine residue may be deleted.

The isolated peptide may comprise the amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 13 to 25. According to a preferred aspect, the six cysteine residues in hBD3 were uniformly replaced by six residues with different polarity, e.g., F, W, Y, C(Acm), A and S, to form corresponding linear analogs of hBD3 [coded as F6, W6, Y6, C(Acm)6, A6 and S6] with different overall hydrophobicity Accordingly, the present invention provides at least one isolated linear peptide comprising the amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 13 to 18, or a fragment thereof.

The peptide may be at least one analog to hBD3. The design principle may be (but not limited to) the following: the decreased cytotoxicity to human cells can be controlled by the rational design of linear analogs of defensins peptides by molecular modelling and theory calculation in terms of overall hydrophobicity and charge density. Overall hydrophobicity is a basic physiochemical property of peptide as a result of folding in water. The overall hydrophobicity (the change of free energy, [Delta]G, kcal/mol) was calculated based on the hydrophobicity scale of Wilmley and White. Greater hydrophobicity is represented by a more positive [Delta]G. The overall hydrophobicity and charge density are associated with 3D structure of the peptides. Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention.</p><p>MATERIALS AND METHODS</p><p>Solid-phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)</p><p>Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-protected L-amino acids and resin were purchased from Advanced ChemTech (now advanced automated peptide protein TECHNOLOGIES, aappTEC) (KY, U.S.A.) and were used with the following side-chain protective groups: Arg (pbf)&lt;1&gt; or Arg(pmc), Lys(Boc), Tyr(But), Trp(Boc), Thr(But), Ser(But), Gln(Trt), Glu(OBut), Asn(Trt), Cys(Acm), and Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-Wang resin (substitution 0.72mmol/g). Syntheses of six linear analogs of hBD3 were carried out on Apex 396 by Fmoc-chemistry. Acylation (coupling reaction) was carried out with HBTU-HOBT (HBTU is N-[MH- benzotriazol-1-yl)-(dimethylamino)methylene]-/V-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate [Lambda]/-oxide, and HOBT is N-hydroxybenzotriazole) in DMF (N,N-Dimethylformammide) at a synthesis scale of 0.04 mmol. Fmoc deprotection was carried out with 20% piperidine in DMF. The resulting peptidyl resins were treated with a freshly prepared mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/triisopropylsilane (TIS)/phenol/Thionisole/water (90/1/2.5/5/1.5, the ratio of volume percent) for 2-3 h at room temperature. The crude peptides were precipitated by filtration into ice-cold diethyl ether, separated by centrifugation, washed three times with ice-cold ether and dried by automated evaporation of ether and other remaining/residual solvents in crude solid products in fume hood or dried under vacuum at room temperature. For further purification, the crude products were dissolved into mixture solvents of 5% CAN, 0.1% TFA in H2O, and loaded onto a semi-preparative column (Waters, a Delta PAK &lt;"&gt;C18,</p><p>300 mm x 7.8 mm, 15 [mu]m, 100 A, , flow rate 3 ml/min; eluant A, 0.01% TFA in Dl water; eluant B, 0.01 % TFA in CAN; gradient 20-35% of eluant B in 20 min; UV detection at 210 nm (Waters 2695 separations module with an auto-sampler and 996 photodiode array detector (PDA). Purified peptides were characterized by analytical HPLC-MS coupled system (Micromass Platform LCZ, Waters Associates using a Delta PAK C18, 150 mm x 3.9 mm, 5 [mu]m, 100 A, flow rate 0.2 ml/min; gradient 18-38% of eluant B in 32 min. The molecular weight characterization by use of Mass Spectrometry of six linear analogs is provided in Figures 8-13.</p><p>Molecular Hvdrophobicitv</p><p>Molecular hydrophobicity of peptides was measured by HPLC-MS at the same experimental conditions, e.g., the same peptide concentration (500 or 100 [mu]g/ml), loading (5 [mu]l) and flow rate of 0.2 ml/min in the same gradient 18-38% of eluant A in 32 min and relatively compared in term of retention time (Rt) of product peak.</p><p>CD Spectroscopy</p><p>Circular dichroism spectroscopy was conducted on Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter in aqueous solution (pH of 5.0-5.5) and other different media, e.g., 10 mM and 20 mM SDS, 20, 50, 70% (volume) TFE in Dl water. The six analogs were at the concentration of 125 [mu]g/ml and wild-type hBD3 was in 100 [mu]g/ml. CD measurements were performed at 27 &lt;0&gt;C within a wavelength range of 196-260 nm. Every sample and solvent was scanned three times and CD of solvent was deducted from that of sample solution. The results are shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4.</p><p>Antimicrobial Assay for Defensins Analogs</p><p>Materials</p><p>The bacteria assayed included Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Bacillus cereus</p><p>NCTC 2599. Sterile flat-bottom, 96-well tissue culture plates (92096, TPP) was used for assay. The inner surface of microplate cover was treated with 0.05% Triton X-100 in 20% ethanol to prevent condensation of water droplets. Growth kinetics in 96-well microplates was monitored (as turbidity) with the Tecan Genios Plus microplate reader using software Magellan v5.03 and 620-nm filter. Seed culture was monitored on Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 2000 UV[Lambda]/isible spectrophotometer using 600-nm wavelength. Antibacterial activities of the analogs and wild-type hBD3 were determined for E. coli, B. cereus, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa by measuring bacteria growth in liquid broth in the presence of the serially diluted peptides. The LD50 is the concentration of peptide at which 50% of the viable cells are killed. The results are reported in Figures 7(A1B, C and D).</p><p>Calibration</p><p>The bacteria were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB) from overnight plate culture. The cell suspension was diluted to OD 0.1 (600nm, Pharmacia Biotech Ultropec 2000 UV/Visible spectrophotometer) in mixture of 1OmM Pot Phos buffer/MHB (equal volume (PMH). This cell suspension gave a concentration of 10&lt;7&gt; CFU/ml. Colony count was done for confirmation. A 10-fold dilution series of this suspension ranging from 10&lt;7&gt; to 10&lt;1&gt; CFU/ml was made in PMH (in sextuplicate for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Bacillus cereus NCTC 2599; in quadruplicate for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and in triplicate for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). The final volume per well was 20OuI. For negative control well, 200 ul of uninoculated PMH was added.</p><p>Cytotoxicity Assay</p><p>Cytotoxicity of these analogs was analyzed on primary cultured human normal conjunctiva epithelial cells by measuring cell viability using CellTiter-blue. Wild type hBD3 was used as a control in all analyses. Figure 5. Hemolysis Assay</p><p>The release of hemoglobin from fresh rabbit erythrocytes was used as a measurement for the membranolytic activity of tested peptides. Figure 6.</p><p>RESULTS</p><p>Example 1: linear analogs with 45 residues of hBD3</p><p>Synthesis of analogs of hBD3. The solid-phase synthesis of six linear analogs with 45 residues of hBD3 was performed using Fmoc-chemistry as described in detailed in Table 1. (sequence, total residue, hydrohophobicity, net charge, overall hydrohopbicity). Yields of crude product and pure product based on synthesis scale was reported, see supporting information Table 1.</p><p>Table 1. the basic physicochemical property of peptides</p><p> </p><p>a. The overall hydrophobicity ([Delta]G, kcal/mol) was calculated based on the hydrophobicity scale of Wimley and White, 1996. Greater hydrophobicity is represented by a more positive [Delta]G; b. Calculated by the Hopp-Woods scale (1983); n.c, not calculated. Molecular Hydrophobicity</p><p>In comparison with native hBD3, this series of linear analogs of hBD3 with full- length and 11 net positive charge are structurally homogenous as they are designed and synthesized only by uniform replacement of six bridging cysteine residues in hBD3 with other six residues with different hydrophobicity, e.g., A1 S, C(Acm), F, Y and W. These linear analogs provide a well-defined model for testing the effect of overall hydrophobicity, second structure and linearity/or constraint imposed by three disulfide bridges on antibacterial, cytotoxicity and hemolytic activities. We have measured the relative molecular hydrophobicity by HPLC-MS in term of retention time (tR) at 500 ug/ml and 100 ug/ml (Table 2) and overall hydrophobicity were calculated based on the hydrophobicity scale of Wilmley and White and Hopp-Woods Scale, respectively. The change trend of overall hydrophobicity, which is calculated based on two different scale, generally fits well, and the HPLC result matches the calculations very well. The general order for the relative molecular hydrophobicity of peptides is as following: W6 &gt; F6 &gt; Y6 &gt; native hBD3 &gt; A6 &gt; S6 &gt; C(Acm)6. However the order for the hydrophobicity of replacement residue is as following: Phe &gt; Tyr = Trp &gt; Cys &gt; Ala &gt; Ser (the data for C(Acm) is unavailable) [Black, S. D. and Mould, D. R.

In many instances, hydrophobic interactions have been reported to control hemolytic activities; whereas electrostatic interactions are suggested to be more important for antibacterial activity (Harder et al., 2001). These results show that the presence of proper hydrophobic residues, e.g. W, F and S. and balance of hydrophobic to hydrophilic surface area are key structural determinants which indicate the antibacterial and hemolytic activities.</p><p>CD Spectroscopy and Peptide Secondary Structure</p><p>Previous X-ray and NMR studies [some publications, including hBD2, <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sawai et ah, Biochemistry, 2001 , 40, 3810-16</bibl>; hBD3, <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Schibli et al., JBC 2002, 277(10), 8279-89</bibl>] have shown that the tertiary structures of human [beta]- defensins (hBD1- 3) are similar with a short [alpha]-helical segment proceeding a triple-stranded anti- parallel [beta]-sheet held rigidly by three disulfide bonds. However, in the absence of constraints imposed by three disulfide bonds, linear analogs of hBD3 are likely to be flexible and random in aqueous solution, adopting conformations dictated by the environment. Therefore, it was of interest to systemically determine the solution conformations of the linear peptides by CD spectroscopy. An analysis of the structural characteristics of hBD3 derivatives was performed by CD spectrometry in an aqueous solution and in the presence of the organic modifier trifluoroethanol (TFE) or membrane mimetic SDS micelle. (Figures 2-4). TFE has been widely used in protein structure study since it can induce the adoption of stable, protein-like conformations from otherwise unstructured/random peptides in aqueous solution. The CD spectra of six linear analogs and wild- type hBD3 in aqueous solution are very similar, and agree very well with the CD spectrum of native hBD3. All analogs and wild-type hBD3 in water had a strong minima at 196-200 nm in accordance with a predominantly unordered structure, showing largely random coil structure in aqueous solution. This result shows that the existence of three disulfide bonds or their absence and the type of replacement for the amino acid residues has no significant effect on the secondary structure of hBD3 derivatives, thus, the secondary structure seems to be dictated independently of the presence of multiple disulfide bridges or the replacement residues of the six cysteine residues. In the presence of different amounts of an organic modifier, TFE, in water, e.g., 20, 50, 70% (only CD spectra in 50% TFE was reported here), all analogs and native hBD3 undergo amarked conformational transition, their CD spectra were red-shifted with clearly observable double minima at wavelengths of 205-222 nm and a strong positive peak at around 190-193 nm. Such a spectrum is characteristic of [alpha]-helical structures and therefore it is possible to conclude that the presence of TFE increases the proportion of helical conformation in these peptides solutions. The [alpha]-helix content of the six analogs and wild-type hBD3, especially for W6, S6, F6, wild-type hBD3 and Y6, greatly increased in the presence of THF, which is known to stabilize this type of conformation, their difference in [alpha]-helix content may arise from possible stacking of aromatic ring side groups of residues in W6, F6, Y6, or possible hydrogen-bonding between side groups of residues in A6 or the stabilization force of three disulfide bonds to the well-defined conformations of [alpha]-helix in/for wt-h B D3. In some cases (W6, S6, C(Acm)6), the higher the concentration of TFE, the higher [alpha]-helix content. This CD transition also occurs in 10 mM and 20 mM SDS micelles, which better mimic the anisotropic lipid environment of membranes, the [alpha]-helix content of the six analogs and wild-type hBD3, especially for W6, S6, wild-type hBD3, F6 and Y6, also increased to some extent due to the same effect of structural determinants as they do in the presence of TFE. In most cases, especially for W6 and Y6, [alpha]-helix content is higher at 10 mM rather than 20 mM SDS. Furthermore, if the molecule is rigid, it would be expected to be resistant to any major solvent-induced conformational changes. However, in the presence of TFE and SDS, the CD spectrum appears to change dramatically, indicating the strong interactions of the peptides with the solvents.</p><p>The molecular weight of six linear analogs was characterized by use of Mass Spectrometry according to standard technique known to any skilled person in the art. The results are reported in Figures 8-13.</p><p>It was reported that no correlation has been generally been observed between degree of helicity and antibacterial activity; high helicity often correlates with high hemolytic properties, albeit not with antibacterial activity [<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Oren et al., Biochemistry, 1997, 36, 1826-35</bibl>].

W6, S6 and F6 are the most potent analogs in comparison with hBD3, while Y6, C(Acm)6 and A6 have relatively less potency. W6 has lower LD50, being lower than 5[mu]g/ml, against E. co// and S. aureus and it has comparable LD50, being less than 8[mu]g/ml, against P. aeruginosa and [beta]. cereus. S6 and F6 also have comparable level LD50s (less than 10 [mu]g/ml) against the four pathogens. For C6, Y6 and A6, most LD50s against pathogens are in the range of 10-20 [mu]g/ml. The result show this series of linear analogs, especially W6, S6 and F6 have high activity to kill E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus compared with the cyclic or noncylic 40-reside hBD3 derivatives [<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Enno Kluver et al., Biochemistry, 2005</bibl>], which were measured in terms of the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC). LD90s of S6, W6 and F6 are in the range of 5-20 [mu]g/ml, they have comparable activity in comparison with wt hBD3 and other cyclic or linear hBD3 analogs, which have most potent activity [<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hoover et al., Antimicrobial Agents and chemotherapy, 2003, 47(9), 2804-09</bibl>].</p><p>The fact that the 45-residue full-length linear variants are as active as their wild type hBD3 with multi disulfide bridges shows that the presence of three disulfide bonds is not a necessary requirement for antimicrobial activity. In contrast, reduced hBD2 was earlier reported to be inactive as a anti-microbial [<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Enno Kluver et al., Biochemistry, 2005</bibl>]. The tryptophan-rich derivative, W6, is the most potent antimicrobial. This high activity can be assigned to the presence of six tryptophan residues. The tryptophan-rich variant can be compared with other tryptophan-containg antimicrobial peptides such as tachyplesin W4, tritrpticin, indolicidin and lactoferricin, in which tryptophan has been reported to be an essential constituent. The aromatic indolyl side chain of tryptophan is capable of [pi]-[pi] stacking interactions and can participate in hydrogen bonding, particularly in an interfacial environment. For tyrosine- and phenylalanine- rich variants Y6 and F6 may also be capable of [pi]-[pi] stacking interactions and/or can participate in hydrogen bonding, just as the tachyplesin derivatives, Y4 and F4 were found.</p><p>The antimicrobial activity of hBD3 derivatives depends on their ability to contact the pathogen cell membrane by electrostatic interactions between cationic hBD3 analogs and negative membrane of the pathogen, and for the antimicrobial molecule to insert into the membrane by hydrophobic interactions. The major determining structural factors are the net positive charge and the overall hydrophobicity. The overall hydrophobicity of peptides was calculated and measured by HPLC. Among the linear analogs and wild type hBD3, the most hydrophobic W6 and most hydrophilic S6 are potent antimicrobials, it shows that the third key structural determinant, the balance between hydrophilic surface area and hydrophobic surface area, thus maintaining an amphiphilic conformation, is of importance to maintaining high antibacterial activity.</p><p>In medium of low ionic strength, three linear 45-reside hBD3 derivatives were of similar potency compared to their disulfide bridged counterparts. No dependence on substitution of the cysteine residues was found, that is the replacement of cysteine by alanine (A), tryptophan (W) or carboxamidomethylated cysteine [C(Cam)] did not significantly change antibacterial activity compared to that of fully disulfide-bridged hBD3 peptides.</p><p>Cytotoxicity to Mammalian Cells and Hemolytic Activity</p><p>The potent anti-microbial linear analogs and wild-type hBD3 were tested regarding their cytotoxicity to human cells. Cytotoxicity of these analogs was analyzed on primary cultured human normal conjunctiva epithelial cells by measuring cell viability using CellTiter-blue. See Figure 5. Wild type hBD3 was used as a control in all analyses. It is well established that cationic peptides not only interact with pathogen cells, but can also display toxic potential to mammal cells and eukaryotic cells. Microbial cell membranes consist of anionic phosphatidylcholine glycerol as a major component, however, eukaryotic cell membranes contain mainly zwitterionic, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine susceptible to hydrophobic interactions [<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Yeaman and Yount, Biochemistry, 2005</bibl>]. Therefore, it has been proposed that hemolytic activity of cationic antimicrobial peptides are directly connected with the hydrophobicity of peptides. [<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hwang and Vogel, Biochemistry, 2005</bibl>]. The cytotoxicity of each of the six linear peptides was much lower than that of wild- type hBD3 in the concentration of 6-100 ug/ml. The result clearly shows that it does not matter too much if the hydrophobicity of linear hBD3 analogs is high or low, they have decreased cytotoxicity in comparison with wild type hBD3. As the main 1 -dimensional structural difference between linear analogs and the wild type hBD3 lies in the cyclic structure formed by disulfide bonds or its linearity due to the replacement of six cysteine residues by other residues, thus, it means the natural three disulfide-bond pattern in wild type hBD3 should be the main structural determinant for its high cytotoxicity. In other words, the linear polypeptide backbone is a key structural factor to the reduced cytotoxicity of the analogs. The difference in cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity of linear analogs are due to the sequence, which led different hydrophobicity. A6 S6 and C(Acm)6 with low hydrophobicity had the lowest cytotoxicity at a high concentration of 25-100 ug/ml, Y6 with medium hydrophobicity had mid-level cytotoxicity while F6 and W6 with high hydrophobicity had relatively the highest cytotoxicity. As there is no obvious difference in second structural conformation in pure water, the effect of second structural parameters of hBD3 and its derivatives on cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity is minor.</p><p>As human [beta] defensin 3 (hBD3) are structurally characteristic of being cationic amphiphilic with three dimensional folding and even quaternary structures, many structural determinants (1 D, 2D, 3D and quaternary structural factors, e.g., highly net positive charge, sequence and residue distribution, amphiphilic conformation, hydrophobicity, 3D folding and dimmers formation) on antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity. We have designed and synthesized a series of structurally homogenous full-length linear analogs of hBD3, providing a good model to further investigate effect of native three disulfide bonds pattern, amino acid residue with different hydrophobicity and molecular hydrophobicity of peptide on antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity of peptides. Our results of hBD3 derivatives show that high antimicrobial activity, especially for W6 and S6 and F6, have been achieved and the decreased cytotoxicity to human cells was found for the six linear analogs and it can be controlled by the design of peptides in term of hydrophobicity, it shows that the native three disulfide bonds pattern in human [beta] defensins is a key structural determinant to it high cytotoxicity. This finding provides an alternative and new design concept of antimicrobial peptide, and have implication for academic and even commercial research and development of defensins peptides antibiotics, which can be produced at relatively low cost on large scale as the selective formation of disulfide bonds and complicated separation of defensins analogs with three disulfide bonds can be avoided or unnecessary. Correspondingly, potent antimicrobial defensins derivatives with little or no toxic effects on host cells might be designed and developed. As these analogs are potent anti-microbials but have low mammalian cell cytotoxicity they have diverse applications, for example, they may be added to contact lens solutions to prevent infections or added to OTC eye care solutions to give them more potency in warding off infections.</p><p>Example 2: C terminal fragment analogs (10 residues) of hBD3</p><p>The two cysteine residues at the C-terminus of the 10-residue fragment of native hBD3 were uniformly replaced by residues of differing hydrophobicity, viz., phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, cysteine and histidine, to form the corresponding short peptides, the second series of hBD3 analogs, [coded as W2, F2, Y2, L2, 12, C2 (or C(Acm)2)] with varying overall hydrophobicities.</p><p>RGRKCCRRKK 10-residue C-terminus fragment of SEQ ID NO: 37 hBD3</p><p>RGRKUVWRRKK W2 SEQ ID NO: 38</p><p>RGRKFFRRKK F2 SEQ ID NO: 39</p><p>RGRKYYRRKK Y2 SEQ ID NO: 40</p><p>RGRKLLRRKK L2 SEQ ID NO: 41</p><p>RGRK//RRKK I2 SEQ ID NO: 42</p><p>RGRKWRRKK V2 SEQ ID NO: 43</p><p>RGRKHHRRKK H2 SEQ ID NO: 44</p><p>RGRKCf/4cm)CfAc/T?)R RKK C2 Tor CfAcmtel SEQ ID NO: 45</p><p>This series of engineered short peptides are designed, synthesized and structurally characterized by mass spectra and molecular hydrophobicity analysis using experimental and theoretical methods as described above. Molecular hydrophobicity</p><p>The overall molecular hydrophobicity of the C-terminus hBD3 analogs were measured by RP-HPLC-MS in terms of retention time at 1 mg/ml (Table 4 and Figure 14). RP- HPLC is an approach that is commonly employed for such comparisons of peptides or amino acid side chains among antibacterial peptides. Since the stationary phase of C18-modified silica is hydrophobic and the mobile phase (water-acetonitrile) is hydrophilic, longer retention times should be correlated with higher hydrophobicity. The measured order for the molecular hydrophobicity of the peptides is as follows: W2 &gt; F2 &gt; L2 &gt; I2 &gt; Y2 &gt; V2 &gt; C2 &gt; H2.</p><p>Table 4.

Order for The order for overall hydrophobicity of peptides: W2 &gt; F2 &gt; L2 &gt; I2 &gt; Y2 &gt; V2 &gt; C2 &gt; H2</p><p>The relative hydrophobicities of the peptides were also calculated based on the Hopp- Woods hydrophilicity scale (Table 5). The order for overall hydrophobicity of this series of peptides: W2 &gt; F2 &gt; Y2 &gt; L2 = I2 &gt; V2 &gt; H2. This scale is a hydrophilic index where apolar residues have been assigned negative values, and is typically used to identify antigenic regions based on hydrophilic patches. For each peptide, we summed the values corresponding to each residue separately in each peptide to gauge the peptide's relative hydrophobicity with respect to the remaining analogs. The trend in hydrophobicity of peptides computed using this scale generally matches that of the experimental HPLC retention time data, except for the order for Y2, L2 and 12. C2 [C(Acm)2], was excluded as Acm does not have a corresponding value in the Hopp- Woods scale. The eight peptides show relatively high hydrohphilicity, however, the overall molecular hydrophobicity varies in a large range (Table 4 and Figure 14).</p><p>Table 5.

The primary results of the cytotoxicity tests (Figure 15) show that four peptides show decreased cytotoxicity in the concentration range of 6.25-200 [mu]g/ml in comparison with native hBD3, as did the first series of six linear full-length analogs of hBD3 [F6, W6, Y6, A6, S6 and C(Acm)6] . Thus, when comparing Table 4 and Figure 15, this series of peptides corroborates our earlier conclusions that hydrophobicity correlate well with cytotoxicity. We have shown the new peptide designs reduces cytotoxicity and this is particularly important, considering that these peptides will be directed to mucosal surfaces which are covered by epithelial cells. </p><p>References</p><p>1. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ganza, T.
