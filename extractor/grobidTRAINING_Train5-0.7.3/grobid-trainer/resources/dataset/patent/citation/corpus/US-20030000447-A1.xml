Field of the Invention </p><p>[0003] This invention relates generally to mooring systems for offshore floating terminals. In particular, the invention relates to an apparatus and method by which a steel catenary riser is connected to a turret of a floating storage and/or production vessel while simultaneously fluidly coupling the riser to a flowline in the turret. </p><p>[0004] 2. Description of the Prior Art </p><p>[0005] Flexible riser hang-off systems have been proposed for hanging off Steel Catenary Risers (SCRs) from offshore terminals. FIG. 1 of the attached drawings shows a typical prior art receptacle/flexjoint assembly <b>10</b> for an SCR <b>12</b> where a “flexjoint” (a proprietary product of Oil States Industries Inc.) assembly <b>11</b> is hung off the side <b>14</b> of a production platform by a receptacle frame <b>13</b>. A sealed fluid coupling between riser <b>12</b> and a platform flowline <b>7</b> is accomplished. Other prior art riser hang-off assemblies <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>C with pull-in hardware <b>16</b> are illustrated in FIGS. 2 through 4. FIG. 2 shows a prior art hang-off arrangement known as a LYNX™ system. An I-tube <b>60</b> is mounted in an opening of a mono-buoy structure <b>150</b>. A pull in head <b>16</b> is secured to a frustro-conical shaped connecter <b>8</b> and flex joint <b>11</b>A secured to the top of the riser <b>12</b>. A sealed connection is made at I-tube seal <b>9</b>, when the riser is pulled up into the I-tube <b>60</b>. </p><p>[0006]FIG. 3 shows another prior art hang-off arrangement where a riser <b>12</b> is pulled alongside a platform <b>14</b> for sealed fluid connection to a platform flowline. The arrangement of FIG. 3, known as an Alligator Rigid Riser Pull-on System, also includes a flex joint assembly <b>11</b>A, a pull-in head <b>16</b> and coupling devices for sealingly coupling riser <b>12</b> to a platform flow line. </p><p>[0007]FIG. 4 shows a prior art hang-off system known as a hydraulic rigid riser pull-in system, also having a flex-joint assembly <b>11</b>B, a pull-in head <b>16</b> and an arrangement for providing a sealed connection between the riser <b>12</b> and flow lines of the structure. </p><p>[0008] While flexible riser hang-off systems such as <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B and <b>10</b>C have been proposed for production platforms, a problem remains for pulling in and connecting SCRs to flowlines of a turret of an offshore terminal such as a Floating Storage and Offloading vessel (FSO) or Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO). The problem concerns connection of the Steel Catenary Riser to the flowline within the mooring turret without costly and dangerous intervention by deep sea divers. </p><p>[0009] 3. Identification of Objects of the Invention </p><p>[0010] A primary object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for connecting a SCR to a flowline within a turret of a FSO/FPSO that will minimize intervention by divers. </p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading><p>[0011] The object identified above, along with other features and advantages of the invention, is embodied in an arrangement with a flexjoint and a hydraulic connector hung from the bottom end of the turret and fluidly coupled to production piping (e.g., a flowline) within the turret. A pull-in line run through the production piping, flexjoint and hydraulic connector, includes a riser pull-in head which latches to a riser connector hub installed in the upper end of the riser. In operation, the pull-in line pulls the riser (SCR) to the hydraulic connector for operational securement to the end of the turret flowline.</p><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading><p>[0012] The invention is described by reference to attached drawings of which: </p><p>[0013] FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> illustrate prior art receptacle/flexjoint interfaces for a Steel Catenary Riser used with offshore production platforms; </p><p>[0014]FIG. 5 illustrates a turret mooring arrangement according to the invention with an SCR riser secured to a bottom end of the turret and fluid coupling to production piping with a flexjoint providing limited flexibility at the connection of the riser to the flowline within the turret; </p><p>[0015]FIG. 6 is an enlarged illustration showing the riser being pulled up for fluid communication with a turret flowline by a pull-in line which runs through the flowline; </p><p>[0016]FIG. 7 is an enlarged illustration showing the riser connected by means of a connector and flex joint to a turret flowline with a pull-in line still attached thereto; </p><p>[0017] FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>13</b>, and <b>13</b>A-<b>17</b> illustrate a method according to the invention for pulling in the riser and for connection of the riser to a flowline in the turret of the vessel. </p><heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading><p>[0018] The arrangement of a flexjoint <b>30</b> with a connector <b>20</b> used to attach a riser <b>10</b> such as a SCR to a flowline <b>40</b> of a turret <b>200</b> of a FSO or FPSO is illustrated in FIGS. 5, 6 and <b>7</b>. FIG. 5 illustrates a broad view of a turret mooring arrangement <b>500</b> in one embodiment of the invention where a riser <b>10</b> such as an SCR is secured at the bottom end of a chain table <b>240</b> with a flexjoint <b>30</b> providing limited flexibility at the connection of the riser <b>10</b> to the flowline <b>40</b> within the turret <b>200</b>. The turret mooring arrangement <b>500</b> includes many components which are generally known in the art, including but not limited to the turret <b>200</b>, anchor chains <b>220</b>, chain table <b>240</b>, and production equipment <b>210</b>. Of particular relevance for this embodiment of the invention is a hoisting mechanism, such as winch <b>50</b>, for “pulling in” the riser <b>10</b> by means of the pull-in line <b>45</b> through flowline <b>40</b> as seen in FIGS. 5, 6, and <b>7</b>. </p><p>[0019]FIG. 6 is an enlarged illustration of FIG. 5 showing the details of the coupling of riser <b>10</b> to pull-in line <b>45</b> while being pulled into a connector <b>20</b>. The pull-in line <b>45</b> passes through turret <b>200</b> and chain table <b>240</b> via flowline <b>40</b> to which a flexjoint <b>30</b> is secured at the lower end of the chain table <b>240</b>. The flexjoint <b>30</b> can be one of many of those known in the art, including, but not limited to those described with reference to prior art arrangements above. A connector <b>20</b> fluidly and sealingly coupled to the flexjoint <b>30</b>A is arranged and designed to receive a connector hub <b>25</b> (better seen in FIG. 13A), which is secured to the upper end of riser <b>10</b>. Connector <b>20</b> and connector hub <b>25</b> cooperatively operate to connect riser <b>10</b> to connector <b>20</b> and to establish fluid-tight communication therebetween. Connector <b>20</b> (such as manufactured by FMC Technologies and known as the FMC TORUS™ connector) preferably includes actuators, which when activated and after hub <b>25</b> is pulled within opening <b>19</b> of connector <b>20</b>, move the coupling members <b>21</b> radially inwardly into groove <b>24</b> of connector hub <b>25</b>. The flexjoint <b>30</b> is placed above the connector <b>20</b> in order to provide alignment of the connector to the riser <b>10</b> during installation. Once connected, a fluid seal is established between seal <b>26</b> of hub <b>25</b> and shoulder <b>27</b> of connector <b>20</b> and flexjoint <b>30</b> thereafter provides flexible alignment of riser <b>10</b> with turret <b>200</b>. </p><p>[0020] As illustrated in FIG. 6, the pull-in line <b>45</b> is lowered through flowline <b>40</b>, flexjoint <b>30</b> and connector <b>20</b>, and is connected to a pull-in head <b>15</b>. The pull-in head <b>15</b> is releasably coupled within the upper end of connector hub <b>25</b> of the riser <b>10</b>. The outer diameter of the pull-in head <b>15</b> is slightly smaller that the internal diameter of flowline <b>40</b>, flexjoint <b>30</b> and connector <b>20</b>, such that it can pass through the bore of those three devices (flowline <b>40</b>, flexjoint <b>30</b>, and connector <b>20</b>). In operation, pull-in line <b>45</b> (with the pull-in head <b>15</b> attached) is lowered through flowline <b>40</b>, flexjoint <b>30</b> and connector <b>20</b>. The pull-in head is then releasably coupled to the connector hub <b>25</b> of the riser <b>10</b>, and a hoist mechanism <b>50</b> or the like (see FIG. 5) is activated to “pull-in” the pull-in line <b>45</b>, pull-in head <b>15</b>, and riser <b>10</b> so that connector hub <b>25</b> of riser <b>10</b> is coupled within connector <b>20</b> as shown in FIG. 7. After the connector hub <b>25</b> is coupled within connector <b>20</b>, the pull-in head <b>15</b> is released from riser <b>10</b> and pulled up together with the pull-in line <b>45</b> through the flowline <b>40</b>. Further operational details are described below. The pull-in line <b>45</b> can be a tensioning member such as, a chain, wire rope, and the like. </p><p>[0021] In operation, once the riser <b>10</b> has been coupled to the connector <b>20</b>, fluid communication can be established with production piping <b>230</b> (see FIG. 5), allowing the passage of fluid (such as hydrocarbons from a subsea well) and the like to and from a seabed <b>2</b> (FIG. 12). </p><p>[0022] The preferred method for installing the riser <b>10</b> is illustrated in FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>17</b>. FIGS. 8, 9, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> illustrate conventional installation steps of the riser <b>10</b> by means of an installation vessel <b>100</b>. FIG. 8 illustrates laying the flowline (riser) away from the position of a FPSO and shows a riser empty and without buoyancy. An acoustic positioning system is used for positioning using a long base line. FIG. 9 shows the next step prior to buoyancy modules being pre-installed on riser joints. FIG. 10 shows the riser <b>10</b> with buoyancy modules <b>11</b>, and FIG. 11 illustrates continuation steps of adding pipe segments to the riser <b>10</b> and with a FSO or FPSO <b>300</b> brought into position near pipeline installation vessel <b>100</b>. Tugs are provided (not shown) to hold the FSO or FPSO in lateral and rotational position. </p><p>[0023]FIGS. 12 and 13 show hand over of the riser <b>10</b> to the FSO/FPSO <b>300</b>. The steps illustrated in FIGS. 12 and 13 include one method for installing the riser pull-in head (or connector hub <b>25</b>) on the top of the riser <b>10</b> (see also FIG. 13A) and installing a clamp <b>70</b> and installation vessel winch line <b>66</b> on the riser. Hand over is completed by disconnecting winch line <b>66</b> from the riser by Remote Operated Vessel (ROV) or by other means. </p><p>[0024] FIGS. <b>13</b>A, <b>14</b>-<b>17</b> illustrate final installation steps where a ROV is used to activate the hydraulic connector <b>20</b>. FIG. 13A illustrates a preferred arrangement for connecting pull-in line <b>45</b> to riser <b>10</b> where the pull-in line <b>45</b> (with pull-in head <b>15</b> attached thereto) has been lowered (see also FIG. 6) through flowline <b>40</b>, flexjoint <b>30</b>, and connector <b>20</b>. As mentioned above, the pull-in head <b>15</b> preferably is arranged and designed to pass through the bore of these devices (flowline <b>40</b>, flexjoint <b>30</b>, and connector <b>20</b>). The pull-in head <b>15</b> is inserted within the upper end of riser <b>10</b> for releasable coupling. The riser <b>10</b>/pull-in head <b>15</b> coupling is accomplished by a retainer <b>14</b> on pull-in head <b>15</b>, which is arranged and designed to fit within a groove <b>26</b> inside of the upper end of riser <b>10</b> and within the connector hub <b>25</b>. The retainer <b>14</b> on the pull-in head <b>15</b> is preferably a spring actuated coupler or similar device which is capable of being compressed when entering the female receptacle portion <b>9</b> of the riser <b>10</b> and then expanding when the coupler reaches the groove <b>26</b>. Attached to an outer portion of the connector hub <b>26</b> is a head releaser <b>27</b>, which when activated releases the pull-in head <b>15</b>. For example, where the pull-in head <b>15</b> is a spring-actuated coupler <b>14</b>, the coupler releaser <b>27</b> squeezes the spring coupler thereby releasing the pull-in head <b>15</b>. </p><p>[0025] By reference to FIGS. 12 and 13, the riser <b>10</b> and pull-in head <b>15</b> can be coupled on a deck of a vessel <b>110</b> (FIG. 13) by pulling the pull-in line <b>45</b> and riser end <b>5</b> to a deck portion of vessel <b>100</b> for coupling. The releasably coupled riser <b>10</b>/pull-in head <b>15</b> is then lowered back into the sea for the remaining operations. </p><p>[0026]FIG. 14 shows pull-in head <b>15</b> releasably coupled to the riser <b>10</b> at its upper end. After coupling is made, a hoist mechanism (FIG. 5) or the like pulls in the pull-in line <b>45</b>, pull-in head <b>15</b>, and riser <b>10</b>. As described above this “pull-in” is accomplished through the flowline <b>40</b> through which the pull-in line <b>45</b> and pull-in head <b>15</b> were lowered. The “pull-in” helps engage connector hub <b>25</b> of riser <b>10</b> within connector <b>20</b>. The flexjoint <b>30</b>, as described above, helps provide alignment of the connector <b>20</b> to the riser <b>10</b> during installation. The connector hub <b>25</b> is prevented from entering an upper portion of the connector and the flexjoint because (1) engagement with the parts of the connector <b>20</b> is arranged and designed to receive the connector hub <b>25</b> and (2) the connector hub <b>25</b> has a larger diameter than the bore diameters of connector <b>20</b>, flexjoint <b>30</b>, and flowline <b>40</b>. </p><p>[0027]FIG. 15 shows connector hub <b>25</b> of riser <b>10</b> engaged with connector <b>20</b>. Upon engagement, ROV <b>110</b> hydraulically activates the connector <b>20</b> (as described above with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7) on the connector <b>20</b>. The activation of the actuators can include engagement of pins or rods <b>21</b> into the groove <b>24</b> (described, by reference to FIG. 6). Such actuation can include spring actuation, hydraulic actuation, and the like. Actuation of pins <b>21</b> into groove <b>24</b> couples the connecter <b>20</b> to hub <b>25</b> and establishes sealing contact between seal <b>21</b> and surface <b>27</b>. </p><p>[0028]FIG. 16 shows the complete coupling of hub <b>25</b> of riser <b>10</b> and connector <b>20</b>. After such coupling, ROV <b>1000</b> engages the head releaser <b>27</b> (described with reference to FIG. 13A) on the connector hub <b>25</b> for releasing the pull-in head <b>15</b>. As mentioned above, such release can include the compression of spring actuators or the like for the release of retainer <b>14</b> on pull-in head <b>15</b> from groove <b>26</b> in connector hub <b>25</b>. </p><p>[0029] After the release of pull-in head <b>15</b>, the pull-in line <b>45</b> and pull-in head <b>15</b> are pulled through flowline <b>40</b> via a hoisting mechanism <b>40</b> (FIG. 5) or the like and removed from the flowline <b>40</b>. Then, if desired, fluid communication between the riser <b>10</b> and production piping <b>230</b> can be hydrotested. </p><p>[0030]FIG. 17 shows the completion of the coupling of the riser <b>10</b> and turret mooring arrangement <b>500</b>. Upon completion, winch line <b>66</b> can be removed via a ROV <b>1000</b>. </p><p>[0031] It should be understood that the invention is not limited to the exact details of construction, operation, or embodiments shown and described, because certain modifications and equivalents will be apparent to one skilled in the art. The invention is accordingly limited only by the scope of the claims. </p></description><claims load-source="us" status="new" lang="EN"><claim-statement>What is claimed is: </claim-statement><claim id="US-20030000447-A1-CLM-00001" num="1"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
