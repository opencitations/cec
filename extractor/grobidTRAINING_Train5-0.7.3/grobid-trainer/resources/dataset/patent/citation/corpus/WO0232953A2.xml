Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A)
PAPP-A was first isolated in 1974 from pregnancy serum along with other proteins believed to be of placenta origin (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lin et al.,  1974, Am J Obstet Gvnecol 118,22336</bibl>). The concentration in serum-reaches about 50 mg/liter  at the end of pregnancy (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Folkersen  et al.,  1981,  Am J Obstet Gvnecof  139,  910-4</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Oxvig et al.,  1995, J Biol
Chem 270,13645-51</bibl>). PAPP-A was originally characterized as a high molecular weight homotetramer (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bischof, 1979, Arch Gvnecol 227,315-26</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lin et al.,  1974,
Am J Obstet Gynecol 118,223-36</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sinosich, 1990, Electrophoresis  11,  70-8</bibl>), but it has now been demonstrated that PAPP-A primarily exists in pregnancy serum and plasma as a covalent, heterotetrameric 2: 2 complex with the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (proMBP), PAPP-A/proMBP (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Oxvig et al.,  1993, J Biol Chem 268,12243-6</bibl>). Only about 1%  of PAPP-A in pregnancy serum and plasma is present as a homodimer, as recently demonstrated (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Overgaard et al.,  2000, J Biol
Chem</bibl>). The existence of the PAPP-A/proMBP complex was revealed, in part, by the isolation of a PAPP-A and a proMBP peptide, linked together by a disulfide bond, from a digest of purified PAPP-A/proMBP (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Oxvig et al.,  1993, J Biol Chem 268, 12243-6</bibl>).</p><p>The subunits of the PAPP-A/proMBP complex can be irreversibly separated by reduction of disulfide bonds and denaturation (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Oxvig et al.,  1993, J Biol Chem 268, 12243-6</bibl>). In reducing SDS-PAGE, the PAPP-A subunit has an apparent molecular weight of 200 kDa (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Oxvig et al., 1994, Biochim Biophvs  Acta 1201,415-23</bibl>), and its 1547-residue sequence is known from cloned cDNA  (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kristensen et al.,  1994, Biochemistry 33,1592-8</bibl>). PAPP-A  is synthesized as a pre-pro-protein (preproPAPP-A), including a 80-residue pre-pro-piece (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Haaning et al.,  1996, Eur J Biochem 237,15963</bibl>). No proteins with global homology to PAPP-A has been reported in the literature, but PAPP-A contains sequence motifs, including an elongated zinc binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) at position 482-492 (numbering according to <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kristensen et al.,  1994, Biochemistry 33,1592-8</bibl>). This motif and a structurally important methionine residue, also thought to reside in PAPP-A at position 556, are strictly conserved within the metzincins, a superfamily of zinc peptidases: astacins, adamalysins (or reprolysins), serralysins  and matrixins (matrix metalloproteinases or MMP's)  (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bode et al.,  1993, FEBS Lett 331,134-40</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Stocker et al.,  1995, Protein Sci 4,823-40</bibl>).</p><p>The proMBP subunit has a calculated peptide mass of 23 kDa (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Barker et al.,  1988, J

PAGE, however, proMBP migrates as a smear of 50-90 kDa that is not visible in
Coomassie-stained gels (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Oxvig et al.,  1993, J Biol Chem 268,12243-6</bibl>), probably due to its strong and unusual glycosylation (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Oxvig et al.,  1994, Biochem Mol Biol Int 33,329-36</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Oxvig et al.,  1994, Biochim Biophvs  Acta 1201,415-23</bibl>). PAPP-A and proMBP are both produced in the placenta during pregnancy, but mainly in different cell types as shown by in situ hybridization (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bonno et al.,  1994, Lab Invest 71,5606</bibl>). Analyses by RT-PCR revealed that both PAPP-A and proMBP mRNA  are pres ent in several reproductive and nonreproductive tissues, although the levels are lower than in the placenta (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Overgaard et al.,  1999, Biol Reprod 61,1083-9</bibl>).</p><p>Clinical use of PAPP-A
Clinically, depressed serum levels of PAPP-A are increasingly being used as a predictor of Down's syndrome pregnancies (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Brambati et al.,  1993, Br J Obstet Gynae-  col 100,324-6</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Haddow et al.,  1998, N Engl  J Med 338,955-61</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wald et al.,  1992, Bai 305,  28</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wald et al.,  1999, N Enql  J Med 341,461-7</bibl>), and it has been shown that PAPP-A serum levels are also depressed in other fetal abnormalities (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Biagiotti  et al.,  1998, Prenat Diagn 18,907-13</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Spencer et al.,  2000, Prenat Diagn 20,411-6</bibl>;

Only recently, the putative metalloproteinase  activity of PAPP-A has been experimentally confirmed (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lawrence et al.,  1999, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 96,3149-53</bibl>).</p><p> PAPP-A was partially purified from human fibroblast-conditioned medium (HFCM) and shown to be responsible for the proteolytic activity of HFCM against insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-4.

IGF bound to IGFBP-4  cannot interact with its receptor, but bioactive IGF is released once the binding protein is cleaved.

Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A2
The novel nucleic acid according to the invention has been isolated from human placenta and characterised by means of sequencing analysis. The novel nucleotide sequence encodes a new polypeptide, PAPP-A2.</p><p>The amino acid sequence of PAPP-A2 is composed of a 233-residue pre-pro-piece and a 1558-residue mature portion. The mature portion of PAPP-A2 is homologous with the mature portion of PAPP-A (approx. 45 % identity), but the prepro-pieces do not show any similarity between the two proteins. Like PAPP-A, PAPP-A2 contains conserved amino acid stretches that classify it as a putative metalloproteinase  of the metzincin superfamily.</p><p> PAPP-A2 has been expressed in a mammalian expression system, and it has been demonstrated that PAPP-A2 is an active enzyme. Further, it has been shown that
 PAPP-A2 cleaves IGFBP-5, Insulin Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5. In com parison, the cleavage of IGFBP-4  by PAPP-A has previously been demonstrated.</p><p>A complementary DNA (cDNA)  which encodes the full length form of PAPP-A2 is identified, sequenced and isolated. The cDNA  or portions of the cDNA  is cloned into expression vectors for expression in a recombinant host. The cDNA  is useful to produce recombinant full-length PAPP-A2 or fragments of PAPP-A2. The cDNA  and the recombinant PAPP-A2 protein derived therefrom are useful in the production of antibodies, diagnostic kits, laboratory reagents and assays.</p><p>The cDNA  and the recombinant PAPP-A2 protein may also be used to identify compounds that affect PAPP-A2 function. PAPP-A2 antisense oligonucleotides or antisense mimetics may be clinically useful for reducing the expression of PAPP-A2 protein and thereby antagonizing the effects of PAPP-A. Similarly, the PAPP-A2 coding sequence can be used for gene therapy to introduce PAPP-A2 into target cells thereby enhancing the effects of PAPP-A2.</p><p>The invention furthermore pertains to PAPP-A2 for use as a therapeutic target for the reduction or elimination of IGFBP-5  proteolytic activity in a cell.</p><p>It is furthermore an objective of the present invention to provide methods for use of
PAPP-A2 for diagnostic purposes.</p><p>Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following drawings and description hereof, from the following detailed description, and from the claims.</p><p>DEFINITIONS
As used herein, PAPP-A2 refers to an isolated PAPP-A2 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence listed in Fig. 1 (SEQ ID NO : 2), or a variant thereof as defined herein. The PAPP-A2 according to the invention, or a variant thereof, may be produced by recombinant DNA technology, or the PAPP-A2 may be naturally occurring.</p><p>A PAPP-A2 encoding nucleotide sequence refers to an isolated nucleic acid having the sequence listed in Fig. 1 (SEQ ID NO : 1), or a variant thereof as defined herein.</p><p>"Active"refers to those forms of PAPP-A2 which retain the biological and/or immunological activities of any naturally occurring PAPP-A2. </p><p>"Naturally occurring PAPP-A2"refers to PAPP-A2 produced by human cells that have not been genetically engineered and specifically contemplates various PAPP
A2s arising from post-translational modifications of the polypeptide including but not limited to acetylation, carboxylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, lipidation, acyla-  tion, or complex formation, covalent or noncovalent, with other polypeptides.</p><p>An"isolated polypeptide"is a protein, or a variant or fragment thereof, which constitutes 90% or more of the protein contents of a given preparation as evaluated by standard methods known in the art of protein chemistry.</p><p>"Derivative"refers to polypeptides derived from naturally occurring PAPP-A2 by chemical modifications such as ubiquitination, labeling (e. g., with radionuclides,  various enzymes, etc.), pegylation  (derivatization with polyethylene glycol), or by insertion (or substitution by chemical synthesis) of amino acids (amino acids) such as ornithine, which do not normally occur in human proteins.</p><p>"Recombinant variant"refers to any polypeptide differing from naturally occurring
PAPP-A2 by amino acid insertions, deletions, and substitutions, created using recombinant DNA techniques. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues may be replaced, added or deleted without abolishing activities of interest, such as proteolytic activity or cell adhesion, may be found e. g. by comparing parts of the sequence of PAPP-A2 with structurally similar proteins (e. g. other metzincin family proteinases), with locally homologous proteins of known disulfide structure, or by secondary structure predictions.</p><p>Preferably, amino acid"substitutions"are the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties, such as, but not limited to, the replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, replacement of an aspartate with a glutamate, or replacement with a threonine with a serine, i. e., conservative amino acid replacements. Further examples and definitions falling within the meaning of the term"substitutions"as applied herein are provided in the detailed description of the invention herein below.</p><p>Amino acid"insertions"or"deletions"are typically in the range of from about about 1 amino acid to about 50 amino acids, such as from about 1 amino acid to about 20 amino acids, for example from about 1 amino acid to about 20 amino acids, such as from about 1 amino acid to about 10 amino acids. The variation allowed may be ex perimentally  determined by systematically making insertions, deletions, or substitutions of amino acids in a PAPP-A2 molecule using recombinant DNA techniques and assaying the resulting recombinant variants for activity.</p><p>Where desired, a"signal or leader sequence"can direct the polypeptide (full length
PAPP-A2, or portions of the PAPP-A2 polypeptide) through the membrane of a cell.</p><p>Such a sequence may be naturally present on the polypeptides of the present invention or provided from heterologous  protein sources by recombinant DNA techniques.</p><p>A polypeptide"fragment","portion", or"segment"is a stretch of amino acid residues of at least about 5 amino acids, often at least about 7 amino acids, typically at least about 9 to 13 amino acids, such as at least about 17 or more amino acids in various embodiments. It may also be a longer stretch of residues up to intact PAPP-A2 in length. To be active, any PAPP-A2 polypeptide or PAPP-A2 polypeptide fragment must have sufficient length to display biologic and/or immunologic activity on their own, or when conjugated to a carrier protein such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin.</p><p>An"oligonucleotide"or polynucleotide"fragment","portion", or"segment"is a stretch of the PAPP-A2 encoding sequence which is useful in the expression of PAPP-A2 polypeptide fragments. It may also be a stretch of nucleotide residues capable of being used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or a hybridization procedure, typically for amplifying or revealing related parts of mRNA  or DNA molecules. In particular, one or both oligonucleotide probes will comprise sequence that is identical or complementary to a portion of PAPP-A2 where there is little or no identity or complementarity with any known or prior art molecule. For this purpose, such oligonucleotide probes will generally comprise between about 10 nucleotides and 50 nu cleotides,  and preferably between about 15 nucleotides and about 30 nucleotides.</p><p>"Animal"as used herein may be defined to include human, domestic or agricultural (cats, dogs, cows, sheep, etc) or test species (mouse, rat, rabbit, etc). </p><p> "Recombinant"may also refer to a polynucleotide which encodes PAPP-A2 and is prepared using recombinant DNA techniques. The DNAs which encode PAPP-A2 may also include allelic  or recombinant variants and mutants thereof.</p><p>"Nucleic acid probes"are prepared based on the cDNA  sequences which encode
 PAPP-A2 provided by the present invention. Nucleic acid probes comprise portions of the sequence having fewer nucleotides than about 6 kb, usually fewer than about
1 kb. After appropriate testing to eliminate false positives, these probes may be used to determine whether mRNAs encoding PAPP-A2 are present in a cell or tis sue or to isolate similar nucleic acid sequences from chromosomal DNA extracted from such cells or tissues as described in (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Walsh  et al.,  1992, PCR Methods Appl  1,
241-50</bibl>). Probes may be derived from naturally occurring or recombinant single-or double-stranded nucleic acids or be chemically synthesized. They may be labeled by nick translation, Klenow  fill-in reaction, PCR or other methods well known in the art. Probes of the present invention, their preparation and/or  labeling are elaborated in (Sambrook et al.,  1989); or (Ausubel et al.,  1989).</p><p> Alternatively, recombinant variants encoding these PAPP-A2 or similar polypeptides may be synthesized or selected by making use of the"redundancy"in the genetic code. Various codon substitutions, such as the silent changes which produce vari ous restriction sites, may be introduced to optimize cloning into a plasmid or viral vector or expression in a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic system. Mutations may also be introduced to modify the properties of the polypeptide, including but not lim ited to activity, interchain affinities, or polypeptide degradation or turnover rate. One example involves inserting a stop codon into the nucleotide sequence to limit the size of PAPP-A2 so as to provide a molecule of smaller molecular weight.</p><p> "Expression vectors"are defined herein as DNA sequences that are required for the transcription of cloned copies of genes and the translation of their mRNAs in an ap propriate host. Such vectors can be used to express eukaryotic genes in a variety of hosts such as bacteria, yeast, bluegreen  algae, plant cells, insect cells and animal cells.</p><p> The term"antibody"as used herein includes both polyclonal and monoclonal anti bodies, as well as fragments thereof, such as, Fv, Fab and F (ab) 2 fragments that are capable of binding antigen or hapten. It includes conventional murine mono clonal  antibodies as well as human antibodies, and humanized forms of non-human antibodies, and it also includes'antibodies'isolated from phage antibody libraries.</p><p>"Ribozymes"are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. The mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence specific hybridization of the ribozyme molecule to complementary target RNA, followed by a endonucleolytic cleavage. Within the scope of the invention are engineered hammerhead motif ribozyme molecules that specifically and efficiently catalyze endonucleolytic cleavage of PAPP-A2 RNA sequences. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within any potential RNA target are initially identified by scanning the target molecule for ribozyme cleavage sites which include the following sequences, GUA, GUU and GUC.</p><p>Once identified, short RNA sequences of between fifteen (15) and twenty (20) ribonucleotides corresponding to the region of the target gene containing the cleavage site may be evaluated for predicted structural features such as secondary structure that may render the oligonucleotide sequence unsuitable. The suitability of candidate targets may also be evaluated by testing their accessibility to hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides,  using ribonuclease  protection assays.</p><p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Isolation of a nucleotide sequence encoding PAPP-A2
The present invention in one aspect relates to a novel cDNA  sequence encoding a protein with global homology to pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A).</p><p>This protein has been denoted PAPP-A2. The complete nucleotide sequence of
PAPP-A2 has been obtained from mRNA  isolated from human placenta (Example 1). The complete nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO : 1)  and translated amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO : 2) of PAPP-A2 are both shown in Figure 1.</p><p>Homology of PAPP-A2 with PAPP-A is evident upon alignment of the two amino acid sequences as shown in Figure 3. PAPP-A2 and PAPP-A share approximately 45% of their amino acid residues. Sequence motifs known to be important for the function of PAPP-A (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kristensen et al.,  1994, Biochemistry 33,1592-8</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lawrence et al.,  1999,  Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 96,  3149-53</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Overgaard et al., 2000, J Biol 
Chem</bibl>) are also found in PAPP-A2.  Principally, PAPP-A2 contains an elongated zinc binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH, amino acids shown by one letter code) at position 733-743 (Figure 2). This motif and a structurally important methionine residue, are strictly conserved within the metzincins, a superfamily  of zinc peptidases (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bode et al.,  1993, FEBS Lett 331,134-40</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Stocker et al.,  1995, Protein Sci 4,823-40</bibl>).</p><p>Like PAPP-A, PAPP-A2 is synthesized as a prepro-protein. PreproPAPP-A2 has 1791 amino acids (Figure 1). There is no homology between the prepro-portions of
PAPP-A and PAPP-A2. Further, the prepro-portions of the two proteins differ significantly in length. The PAPP-A2 prepro-peptide has 233 residues (Figure 3); the
PAPP-A prepro-peptide has 80 residues (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Haaning et al.,  1996, Eur J Biochem 237, 159-63</bibl>).</p><p>Uses of the nucleotide sequence encoding PAPP-A2
The nucleotide sequence encoding PAPP-A2 (or its complement) have numerous applications in techniques known to those skilled in the art of molecular biology.</p><p>These techniques include use as hybridization probes, use in the construction of oligomers for PCR, use in the recombinant production of PAPP-A2 or fragments hereof, and use in generation of anti-sense DNA or RNA, their chemical analogs (e. g. PNA or LNA) and the like. Uses of nucleotides encoding PAPP-A2 disclosed herein are exemplary of known techniques and are not intended to limit their use in any technique known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences disclosed herein may be used in molecular biology techniques that have not yet been developed, provided the new techniques rely on properties of nucleotide sequences that are currently known, e. g., the triplet genetic code, specific base pair interactions, etc.</p><p>It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a multitude of PAPP-A2-encoding nucleotide sequences, some bearing minimal homology to the nucleotide sequence of any known and naturally occurring gene may be produced. The invention has specifically contemplated each and every possible variation of nucleotide sequence that could be made by selecting combinations based on possible codon choices. These combinations are made in accordance with the standard triplet genetic code as applied to the nucleotide se quence of naturally occurring PAPP-A2, and all such variations are to be considered as being specifically disclosed.</p><p>Although the nucleotide sequences which encode PAPP-A2 and/or its variants are preferably capable of hybridizing to the nucleotide sequence of the naturally occurring PAPP-A2 under stringent conditions, it may be advantageous to produce nucleotide sequences encoding PAPP-A2 or its derivatives possessing a substantially different codon usage. Codons can be selected to increase the rate at which expression of the peptide occurs in a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression host in accordance with the frequency with which particular codons are utilized by the host. Other reasons for substantially altering the nucleotide sequence encoding
PAPP-A2 and/or its derivatives without altering the encoded amino acid sequence include the production of RNA transcripts having more desirable properties, such as a greater half-life, than transcripts produced from the naturally occurring sequence.</p><p>Nucleotide sequences encoding PAPP-A2 may be joined to a variety of other nucleotide sequences by means of well established recombinant DNA techniques (Sambrook et al.,  1989). Useful nucleotide sequences for joining to PAPP-A2 include an assortment of cloning vectors, e. g., plasmids, cosmids, lambda phage derivatives, phagemids, and the like, that are well known in the art. Vectors of interest include expression vectors, replication vectors, probe generation vectors, sequencing vectors, and the like. In general, vectors of interest may contain an origin of replication functional in at least one organism, convenient restriction endonuclease sensitive sites, and selectable markers for the host cell.</p><p>Another aspect of the subject invention is to provide for PAPP-A2-specific nucleic acid hybridization probes capable of hybridizing with naturally occurring nucleotide sequences encoding PAPP-A2. Such probes may also be used for the detection of similar PAPP-A2 encoding sequences and should preferably contain at least 50% of the nucleotides from the conserved region or active site. The hybridization probes of the subject invention may be derived from the nucleotide sequences of the SEQ ID 
NO : 1  or from genomic sequences including promoters, enhancer elements and/or possible introns of the respective naturally occurring PAPP-A2. Hybridization probes may be labeled by a variety of reporter groups, including radionuclides such as 32P or 35S, or enzymatic labels such as alkaline phosphatase coupled to the probe via avidin/biotin  coupling systems, and the like.</p><p>PCR as described (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Pat. Nos 4,683,195; and 4,965,188</bibl>) provides additional uses for oligonucleotides based upon the nucleotide sequence which encodes
PAPP-A2. Such probes used in PCR may be of recombinant origin, may be chemically synthesized, or a  mixture of both and comprise a discrete nucleotide sequence for diagnostic use or a degenerate pool of possible sequences for identification of closely related genomic sequences.</p><p>Other means of producing specific hybridization probes for PAPP-A2 DNAs include the cloning of nucleic acid sequences encoding PAPP-A2 or PAPP-A2 derivatives into vectors for the production of mRNA  probes. Such vectors are known in the art and are commercially available and may be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by means of the addition of the appropriate RNA polymerase as T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase and the appropriate radioactively labeled nucleotides.</p><p>It is possible to produce a DNA sequence, or portions thereof, encoding PAPP-A2 and their derivatives entirely by synthetic chemistry, after which the gene can be inserted into any of the many available DNA vectors using reagents, vectors and cells that are known in the art at the time of the filing of this application. Moreover, synthetic chemistry may be used to introduce mutations into the PAPP-A2 sequences or any portion thereof.</p><p>The nucleotide sequence can be used in an assay to detect disease associated with abnormal levels of expression of PAPP-A2. The nucleotide sequence can be labeled by methods known in the art and added to a fluid or tissue sample from a patient under hybridizing conditions. After an incubation period, the sample is washed with a compatible fluid which optionally contains a dye (or other label requiring a developer) if the nucleotide has been labeled with an enzyme. After the compatible fluid is rinsed off, the dye is quantitated and compared with a standard. Alternatively, levels of PAPP-A2 mRNA  can be measured by micro array techniques using immobilized probes. Expression in samples can also be evaluated by (semi-quantitative) RT
PCR. Expression in samples can alternatively be evaluated by techniques based on hybridization. For example, in situ hybridization can be used to detect PAPP-A2 mRNA. This technique has the advantage that it locates the cells that synthesize the mRNA,  but also is less sensitive than RT-PCR.</p><p>Included in the scope of the invention are oligoribonucleotide  sequences, that include antisense RNA and DNA molecules and ribozymes that function to inhibit translation of PAPP-A2. Antisense techniques are known in the art and may be applied herein. Both antisense RNA and DNA molecules and ribozymes of the invention may be prepared by any method known in the art for the synthesis of RNA molecules. These include techniques for chemically synthesizing oligodeoxyribonu cleotides  well known in the art such as for example solid phase phosphoramidite chemical synthesis. Alternatively, RNA molecules may be generated by in vitro and in vivo transcription of DNA sequences encoding the antisense RNA molecule. Such
DNA sequences may be incorporated into a wide variety of vectors which incorporate suitable RNA polymerase promoters such as the T7 or SP6 polymerase promoters. Alternatively, antisense cDNA  constructs that synthesize antisense RNA constitutively or inducibly, depending on the promoter used, can be introduced stably into cell lines.</p><p>The invention also relates to unknown PAPP-A2 genes isolated from other species and alleles of the PAPP-A2 gene, in which PAPP-A2 orthologues or homologues exists. A bacteriophage cDNA  library may be screened, under conditions of reduced stringency, using a radioactively labeled fragment of the human PAPP-A2 clone described herein. Alternatively the human PAPP-A2 sequence can be used to design degenerate or fully degenerate oligonucleotide probes which can be used as PCR probes or to screen bacteriophage cDNA  libraries. The PCR product may be subcloned and sequenced to insure that the amplified sequences represent the PAPP
A2 sequences. The PCR fragment may be used to isolate a full length PAPP-A2 clone by radioactively  labeling the amplified fragment and screening a bacteriophage cDNA  library. Alternatively, the labeled fragment may be used to screen a genomic library. For a review of cloning strategies which may be used, see e. g., (Ausubel et al.,  1989; Sambrook et al.,  1989).</p><p>Expression of recombinant PAPP ; A2  
In order to express a biologically active proteinase, the nucleotide sequence coding for the protein, or a functional equivalent, can be inserted into an appropriate expression vector, i. e., a vector which contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted coding sequence. For example, recombinant protein can be used for immunization to obtain antibodies, as a laboratory reagent, and in diagnostic kits.</p><p>More specifically, methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the PAPP-A2 sequence and appropriate transcriptional/translational control signals. These methods include in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques and in vivo recombination/genetic recombination. See e. g., the techniques described in (Ausubel et al.,  1989; Sambrook et al., 1989).</p><p>Further, expression vectors containing fragments of the PAPP-A2 encoding sequence may also be constructed. In particular, this may be relevant for the use of portions of the PAPP-A2 polypeptide as an antigen for immunization. In addition, the coding sequence of PAPP-A2 or fragments hereof may be cloned in frame with a coding nucleotide sequence present in the vector to result in a fusion protein or a 'tagged'PAPP-A2  protein. For example, such a fusion protein may be composed of
PAPP-A2 and GST, and such tag may be a c-myc tag (for detection) and/or a histidine tag (for purification).</p><p>A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the PAPP-A2 coding sequence or fragments hereof. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing the PAPP-A2 coding sequence; yeast transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing the PAPP-A2 coding sequence; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e. g., baculovirus)  containing the PAPP-A2 coding sequence; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e. g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV  ; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e. g.,  Ti plasmid) containing the PAPP-A2 coding sequence; or animal cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e. g., adenovirus, vaccinia virus, human tumor cells) including cell lines engineered to contain multiple copies of the PAPP-A2 DNA either stably amplified (CHO/dhfr) or unstably amplified in double-minute chromosomes (e. g., murine cell lines).</p><p>The expression elements of these systems vary in their strength and specificities.</p><p>Depending on the host/vector system utilized, any of a number of suitable transcription and translation elements, including constitutive and inducible promoters, may be used in the expression vector. For example, when cloning in bacterial systems, inducible promoters such as pL of bacteriophage lambda, plac,  ptrp, ptac (ptrp-lac hybrid promoter) and the like may be used; when cloning in insect cell systems, promoters such as the baculovirus polyhedron promoter may be used; when cloning in plant cell systems, promoters derived from the genome of plant cells (e. g., heat shock promoters ; the promoter for the small subunit of RUBISCO  ; the promoter for the chlorophyll a/b binding protein) or from plant viruses (e. g., the 35S RNA promoter of CaMV  ; the coat protein promoter of TMV) may be used; when cloning in mammalian cell systems, promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e. g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e. g., the CMV promotor, the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter) may be used; when generating cell lines that contain multiple copies of the PAPP-A2 DNA SV40-,
BPV-and EBV-based vectors may be used with an appropriate selectable marker.</p><p>The expression vector may be introduced into host cells via any one of a number of techinques including but not limited to transformation, transfection, infection, protoplast fusion, and electroporation. The expression vector-containing cells are clonally propagated and individually analyzed to determine whether they produce PAPP-A2 protein. Identification of PAPP-A2 expressing host cell clones may be done by several means, including but not limited to immunological reactivity with anti-PAPP-A2 antibodies, and the presence of host cell-associated PAPP-A2 activity.</p><p>In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the PAPP-A2 expressed. For example, when large quantities of PAPP-A2 are to be produced, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be de sirable.  Such vectors include but are not limited to the E. coli expression vector pUR278 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ruther and Muller-Hill, 1983, Embo J 2,1791-4</bibl>), in which the PAPP-A2 coding sequence may be ligated into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a hybrid AS-lac Z protein is produced. pGEX  vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione  S-transferase (GST).  In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells  by adsorption to glutathione-agarose  beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX  vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned polypeptide of interest can be released from the GST moiety. In yeast, a number of vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters may be used. For a review, see (Ausubel et al.,  1989; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bitter et al.,  1987, Methods Enzvmol 153,516-44</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Rosenfeld, 1999, Methods Enzvmol 306,154-69</bibl>).</p><p>In cases where plant expression vectors are used, the expression of the PAPP-A2 coding sequence may be driven by any of a number of promoters. For example, viral promoters such as the 35S RNA and 19S RNA promoters of CaMV  may be used (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gmunder and Kohli, 1989, Mol Gen Genet 220,  95-101</bibl>); alternatively, plant promoters such as the small subunit of RUBISCO (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Broglie et al.,  1984, Science 224, 838-43</bibl>). </p><p>An alternative expression system which could be used to express PAPP-A2 is an insect system. In one such system, Baculovirus is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus then grows in the insect cells. The PAPP-A2 coding sequence may be cloned into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedron gene) of the virus and placed under control of a Baculovirus  promoter. These recombinant viruses are then used to infect insect cells in which the inserted gene is expressed. For example, see (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Smith et al.,  1983, Mol Cell Biol 3,2156-65</bibl>).</p><p>A variety of mammalian expression vectors may be used to express recombinant
PAPP-A2 in mammalian cells. Commercially-available mammalian expression vectors which may be suitable for recombinant PAPP-A2 expression, include but are not limited to, pMC1 neo (Stratagene), pXT1 (Stratagene), pSG5 (Stratagene), EBOpSV2-neo (ATCC 37593), pBPV-1 (8-2) (ATCC 37110), pcDNA3.1 and its derivatives (Stratagene). Cell lines derived from mammalian species which may be suitable and which are commercially available, include but are not limited to, CV-1,
COS-1, COS-7, CHO-K1,  3T3, NIH3T3, HeLa, C1271, BS-C-1, MRC-5, and 293.</p><p>Further, in mammalian host cells, a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the
PAPP-A2 coding sequence may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription/translation  control complex, e. g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e. g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing PAPP-A2 in infected hosts. See for example (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Logan and Shenk, 1984, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A  81,3655-9</bibl>). Alternatively, the vaccinia 7.5K promoter may be used. See for example (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mackett et al.,  1982, Proc Natl  Acad Sci U S A 79,7415-9</bibl>).</p><p>For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express PAPP-A2 may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with PAPP-A2 DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e. g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and  a selectable marker. Following the introduction of foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines.</p><p>Some applications of the recombinant PAPP-A2 may require the protein to be in purified or partially purified form. Recombinantly expressed PAPP-A2 or fragments of the PAPP-A2 polypeptide can be isolated by liquid chromatography. Various methods of protein purification well known in the art include those described in for example (Scopes, 1987). Alternatively, recombinant PAPP-A2 fusion proteins or'tagged'
PAPP-A2 may be purified by affinity chromatography. Further, antibodies raised against PAPP-A2 may be used for purification by immunoaffinity  chromatography.</p><p>Recombinant variant of PAPP-A2 may be produced by site directed mutagenesis. In some applications of PAPP-A2 such variants may be preferred due to for example increased protein stability, or changes in activity. </p><p>Production and uses of antibodies against PAPP-A2
The recombinant protein may be used to generate antibodies. Monospecific antibodies to PAPP-A2 can be purified from mammalian antisera containing antibodies reactive against PAPP-A2 or can be prepared as monoclonal antibodies reactive with PAPP-A2 using standard techniques.</p><p>Monospecific antibody as used herein is defined as a single antibody species or multiple antibody species with homogenous binding characteristics for PAPP-A2.</p><p>Homogenous binding as used herein refers to the ability of the antibody species to bind to a specific antigen or epitope, such as those associated with the PAPP-A2, as described above. PAPP-A2 specific antibodies are raised by immunizing animals such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, goats, horses and the like, with rabbits or mice being preferred, with an appropriate concentration of PAPP-A2 either with or without an immune adjuvant. For example, antibodies specific against PAPP-A2 can be used for the purification of native and recombinant PAPP-A2, as a laboratory reagent, and in antibody based diagnostic kits.</p><p>Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) reactive with PAPP-A2 can be prepared by conventional methods, such as by immunizing inbred mice with PAPP-A2. The mice are immunized with about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg, preferably about 1 mg, of PAPP-A2 in about 0.5 mi buffer or saline incorporated in an equal volume of an acceptable adjuvant. Freund's complete adjuvant is preferred. The mice receive an initial immunization on day 0 and are rested for about 3 to about 30 weeks. Immunized mice are given one or more booster immunizations of about 0.1 to about 10 mg of PAPP-A2 in a buffer solution such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by the intravenous (IV)  route. Lymphocytes from antibody-positive mice are obtained by removing spleens from immunized mice by standard procedures known in the art. Hybridoma cells are produced by mixing the splenic  lymphocytes with an appropriate fusion partner under conditions which will allow the formation of stable hybridomas. Fused hybridoma cells are selected by growth in hypoxanthine, thymidine and aminopterin supplemented Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) by procedures known in the art. Supernatant fluids are collected form growth positive wells on about days 14,18, and 21 and are screened for antibody produciton by an immunoassay such as solid phase immunoradioassay (SPIRA) using PAPP-A2 as the antigen. The culture fluids are also tested in the Ouchterlony  precipitation assay to determine the isotype of the mAb. Hybridoma cells from antibody positive wells are then cloned. For details, see (Peters and Baumgarten, 1992).</p><p>In vitro production of anti-PAPP-A2 is carried out by growing the hydridoma in
DMEM containing about 2% fetal calf serum to obtain sufficient quantities of the specific mAb. The mAb are purified by techniques known in the art.</p><p>Antibody titers of ascites or hybridoma culture fluids are determined by various serological or immunological assays which include, but are not limited to, precipitation, passive agglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent antibody (ELISA) technique (Crowther, 1995).</p><p>The"monoclonal antibodies"may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clackson  et al.,  1991, Nature 352,624-8</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Marks et al.,  1991,  J Mol Biol 222,581-97</bibl>), for example. Identified phage antibodies can be produced by expression in bacteria.</p><p>Methods such as those described above may be used to produce monospecific antibodies specific for PAPP-A2 polypeptide fragments or full-length nascent PAPP-A2 polypeptide.</p><p>PAPP-A2 antibody affinity columns can be made by adding the antibodies to a gel support, such as Affigel-10  (Biorad), a gel support which is pre-activated with N hydroxysuccinimide  esters such that the antibodies form covalent linkages with the agarose gel bead support. The antibodies are then coupled to the gel via amide bonds with the spacer arm. The remaining activated esters are then quenched with
 1 M ethanolamine HCI  (pH 8). The column is washed with water followed by 0.23 M glycine HCI (pH  2.6) to remove any non-conjugated antibody or extraneous protein.</p><p>The column is then equilibrated in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.3) and the cell culture supernatants or cell extracts containing PAPP-A2 or PAPP-A2 fragments are slowly passed through the column. The column is then washed, and the protein is eluted. The purified PAPP-A2 protein is then dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline. </p><p>Native PAPP-A2  from sources such as human plasma or serum, tissue extracts, or media from nontransfected cell lines (that endogenously secrete PAPP-A2) may also be purified by use of an antibody affinity column.</p><p>Using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against PAPP-A2 a number of assays may be constructed for measurement of PAPP-A2 antigen in body fluids or tissue and cell extracts. Kits based on antibodies may be used for diagnostic purposes.</p><p>The assays include, but are not limited to, precipitation, passive agglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  techniques, and radioimmunoassay (RIA) techniques.</p><p>For example, in one such ELISA,  a sandwich assay can be constructed where antigen present in an sample is caught by immobilized polyclonal anti (PAPP-A2). Detection is then performed by the use of one or more monoclonal PAPP-A2 antibodies and peroxidase conjugated anti (murine IgG).  In another assay, antigen present in an sample is caught by immobilized polyclonal anti (PAPP-A2), and detected using biotinylated polyclonal anti (PAPP-A2). For further examples and details, see (Crowther, 1995). Assays can be calibrated using purified PAPP-A2 to construct a standard curve by serial dilution. The concentration of PAPP-A2 in solution in a purified form can be accurately measured by amino acid analysis (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sottrup-Jensen, 1993, Biochem Mol Biol Int  30,789-94</bibl>).</p><p>Polyclonal antibodies may be used to inhibit the biological activity of PAPP-A2. Specifically, in analogy with the inhibition of the IGFBP-4  proteolytic activity of PAPP-A by polyclonal PAPP-A antibodies (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lawrence et al.,  1999, Proc Natl  Acad Sci U S A 96,3149-53</bibl>), anti (PAPP-A2) may be used to inhibit the proteolytic activity of PAPP
A2. Certain monoclonal antibodies may also be inhibitory towards the activity of
PAPP-A2. Such monoclonal antibodies are likely to recognize an epitope in close proximity to the active site of PAPP-A2, but the inhibitory activity may also be based on binding to epitopes other than those close to the active site. Inhibitory mono clonal  antibodies can be obtained by immunization with PAPP-A2, PAPP-A2 fragments, with peptides derived from PAPP-A2.</p><p>Inhibitory (monoclonal) antibodies may have therapeutic value in conditions of pathologies in which it may be desirable to decrease the activity of PAPP-A2. </p><p>Activity of PAPP-A2
Like PAPP-A, PAPP-A2 contains conserved amino acid stretches that classify it as a putative metalloproteinase  of the metzincin superfamily (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Stocker et al.,  1995, Protein
Sci 4,823-40</bibl>). It has been experimentally verified that PAPP-A2 does exhibit proteolytic activity by demonstrating its cleavage of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-5 (Example 6.7).</p><p>In general, proteolytic activity of PAPP-A2 against potential protein substrates may be evaluated by the incubation of purified or partially purified PAPP-A2 with the potential substrate under a variety of experimental conditions (such as for example temperature, buffer composition, ionic strength, and pH). Enzymatic activity of
PAPP-A2 against the protein in question can be evaluated by SDS-PAGE (in which degradation or release of well defined proteolytic fragment (s) will be evident), or by high-pressure liquid chromatographic detection of released peptide (s). By means of such procedures, other substrate targets of PAPP-A2 may be identified. Incubation with a variant of PAPP-A2 where, for example, a residue in the active site has been substituted to obtain an inactive enzyme, serves as a proper negative control.</p><p>Random peptide libraries consisting of all possible combinations of amino acids attached to a solid phase support may be used to identify peptides that can be cleaved by PAPP-A2. Identification of such peptides may be accomplished by screening a peptide library with recombinant soluble PAPP-A2. Methods for expression and purification of the enzyme are described above and may be used to express recombinant full length PAPP-A2 or fragments, analogs, or derivatives thereof depending on the functional domains of interest. For further details, see (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Meldal, 1998, Methods Mol Biol 87,65-74</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Meldal, 1998, Methods Mol Biol 87,51-7</bibl>). Alternatively, peptide substrates may be derived from identified protein substrates of PAPP-A2.  </p><p>Alternatively, phage display of peptide libraries may be used to identify peptides that can be cleaved by PAPP-A2 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Matthews and Wells, 1993, Science 260,1113-7</bibl>).</p><p>Peptides that function as PAPP-A2 substrates may function in assays for the detection of PAPP-A2 proteolytic activity in body fluids or tissue and cell extracts. Substrate peptides may be derivatized to function in an assay based on quenchedfluorescence (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Meldal, 1998, Methods Mol Biol 87,65-74</bibl>). Kits based on such, or other, techniques may be used for diagnostic purposes in pathologies where measurement of PAPP-A2 activity is relevant.</p><p>Identification of agents that modify the activity of PAPP-A2
An assay for the detection of PAPP-A2 proteolytic activity, as described above, provides a method for the identification of molecules that modify the activity of PAPP-
A2. Such molecules may be, for example, peptides, derivatized peptides, hydroxamic acid derivatized peptides, small organic molecules, or antibodies.</p><p>The screening of peptide libraries can be used to discover pharmaceutical agents that act to modulate and/or inhibit the biological activity of PAPP-A2. Methods for expression and purification of the enzyme are described above and may be used to express recombinant full length PAPP-A2 or fragments, analogs, or derivatives thereof depending on the functional domains of interest. Random peptide libraries consisting of all possible combinations of amino acids attached to a solid phase support may be used to identify peptides that are able to modulate and/or inhibit
PAPP-A2 activity by binding to the active site or other sites of PAPP-A2. For example, see (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Meldal,  1998, Methods Mol Biol 87,75-82</bibl>).</p><p>Similarly, combinatorial chemistry may be used to identify low molecular weight organic molecules that affect the activity of PAPP-A2.</p><p>Measurement of complexes of PAPP-A or PAPP-A2
 PAPP-A primarily exists in pregnancy serum as a disulfide bound 2: 2 complex with the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (proMBP), PAPP-A/proMBP. In addition to the PAPP-A/proMBP complex, proMBP exists in the circulation as a disulfide bound 2: 2 complex with angiotensin (ANG), proMBP/ANG, and a fraction of this complex is further complexed to a fragment of complement component C3dg (PROMBP/ANG/C3dg) (Oxvig, 1995; Christiansen, 2000).</p><p>The level of complexes comprising PAPP-A and/or PAPP-A2 and/or proMBP in body fluids of an individual may be indicative of predisposition to a clinical condition or indicative of the presense of a clinical condition. Accordingly, the present invention in one embodiment is directed towards a method of diagnosing a clinical condition or diagnosing predisposition to said clinical condition in an individual comprising the steps of a) providing a body sample from said individual ; and b) measuring the level of a complex selected from the group consisting of
PAPP-A/proMBP, PAPP-A2/proMBP, PAPP-A/PAPP-A2, PAPP-A/PAPP
A2/proMBP, proMBP/ANG and proMBP/ANG/C3dg  in said body fluid sam ple ; and c) diagnosing the clinical condition or diagnosing predisposition to the clinical condition, wherein the level of the complex above or below a predetermined value is indicative of the clinical condition or predisposition to the clinical condition.</p><p>Furthermore, the levels of complexes comprising PAPP-A and/or PAPP-A2 and/or proMBP in body fluids of a mammalian mother may be indicative of predisposition to a clinical condition or indicative of the presense of a clinical condition in a fetus of said mother. Hence, the present invention provides methods of diagnosing a clinical condition or diagnosing predisposition to said clinical condition in a mammalian fetus comprising the steps of a) providing a body fluid sample from the mother of said fetus; and b) measuring the level of a complex selected from the group consisting of
PAPP-A/proMBP, PAPP-A2/proMBP, PAPP-A/PAPP-A2, PAPP-A/PAPP
A2/proMBP, proMBP/ANG and proMBP/ANG/C3dg in said body fluid sam ple ; and c) diagnosing the clinical condition or diagnosing predisposition to the clinical condition, wherein the level of the complex above or below a predetermined value is indicative of the clinical condition or predisposition to the clinical condition.</p><p>In particular, according to the present method the level of one or more of the following complexes may be determined:
PAPP-A/proMBP
PAPP-A2 and proMBP (PAPP-A2/proMBP)
PAPP-A2 and PAPP-A (PAPP-A/PAPP-A2)
PAPP-A/PAPP-A2 with proMBP (PAPP-A/PAPP-A/proMBP) proMBP/ANG proMBP/ANG/C3dg 
The level of complexes comprising PAPP-A and/or PAPP-A2 and/or proMBP in a body fluid sample may be determined by any conventional method known to the person skilled in the art. For example, the level can be measured by a method comprising the use of immunospecific reagents specifically interacting with one or more components of the complex desirable to measure, such as immunospecific reagents specifically interacting with PAPP-A, PAPP-A2, proMBP, ANG or C3gd. Immuno-  specific reagents may for example bemonoclonal  antibodies, polyclonal antibodies and/or antigen binding fragments thereof, specific towards the individual components of the complex.</p><p>Such methods include but are not limited to sandwich ELISA,  wherein an immunospecific reagent specifically recognising one component of the complex is employed as catching antibody and another immunospecific reagent specifically recognising another component if the complex is employed as detection antibody. The detection antibody is preferably either directly or indirectly detectable, for example the detection antibody may be directly coupled to a detectable label or the detection antibody may be capable of interacting with another agent which is coupled to a detectable label.</p><p>A detectable label may for example be a fluorescent label, a chromatophore, a ra-  dioactive label, a heavy metal or an enzyme. </p><p>For example, the level of PAPP-A/proMBP complexes in a body fluid sample may be determined by sandwich ELISA using a PAPP-A specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibody for catching and a proMBP specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibody for detection or the level of proMBP/ANG in a body fluid sample may be determined by sandwich ELISA using a proMBP specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibody for catching and a ANG specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibody for detection.</p><p>The clinical condition may be any clinical condition which may be diagnosed by the level of complexes comprising PAPP-A and/or PAPP-A2 and/or proMBP or wherein predisposition may be diagnosed by the level of complexes comprising PAPP-A and/or PAPP-A2 and/or proMBP. The clinical condition may for example be selected from the group comprising Down's syndrome, preeclampsia  and acute coronary syndrome, including unstable angina and myocadial  infarction.</p><p>The body fluid sample may be any usefull  body fluid sample, such as a blood sample including a serum sample, a urine sample, a saliva sample or an amniotic fluid sample.</p><p>In particular, the level of PAPP-A/proMBP may be determined when the clinical condition is selected from the group consisting of Down's syndrome, and acute coronary syndrome including unstable angina and myocardial infarction.</p><p>In one embodiment of the present invention diagnosing Down's syndrome or diagnosing predisposition to Down's syndrome, comprises determining the level of
PAPP-A/proMBP, wherein the level of PAPP-A/proMBP below a predetermined value is indicative of the Down's syndrome or predisposition to Down's syndrome.</p><p>In another embodiment of the present invention diagnosing acute coronary syndrome, including unstable angina and myocardial infarction or diagnosing predisposition to acute coronary syndrome, including unstable angina and myocardial infarction, comprises determining the level of PAPP-A/proMBP, wherein the level of PAPP-A/proMBP  above a predetermined value is indicative of the acute coronary syndrome, including unstable angina and myocardial infarction or predisposition to acute coronary syndrome, including unstable angina and myocardial infarction. </p><p>In yet another embodiment the level of proMBP/ANG may be determined to diagnose predisposition to Down's syndrome or to diagnose Down's syndrome.</p><p>All the above mentioned methods of diagnosis may also be performed in combination with one or more other methods of diagnosis. In addition, more than one different diagnosis according to the present invention may be performed, for example it is possible to measure the level of more than one complex or to measure the level of one complex in different body samples.</p><p>Use of PAPP-A2 to generate natural proteolytic  fragments
PAPP-A2 may be used to generate natural fragments of proteins that are specifically cleaved by PAPP-A2. As in the case of IGFBP-5  (see Examples 6.7 and 6.9), such fragments may have biological effects different from intact IGFBP-5. Fragments can be purified by standard chromatography after cleavage with purified PAPP-A2 (see
Example 6.9).</p><p>Design of fragments of PAPP-A2 for expression
Because all cysteine residues found in mature PAPP-A are also found in mature
PAPP-A2 (see Figure 3), the pattern of disulfide bonds can be assumed to be the same for PAPP-A2 for those common cysteine residues. Therefore, knowledge of the disulfide structure of the PAPP-A subunit (see Figure 8) can be used to rationally design fragments of PAPP-A2 in which pairing of all cysteine residues is possible.</p><p>Putative domain boundaries of PAPP-A2 can be defined based on the disulfide structure shown in Figure 8. Those domains can be expressed separately or in combination. In the event that a domain contains a cysteine residue known to form an inter-chain disulfide bridge to another PAPP-A subunit or to proMBP (see Figure 8), it may be required that this cysteine is mutated to for example a serine or an alanine residue
Thus, possible boundary regions are between Cys-403 and Cys-499, between Cys828 and Cys-881, between Cys-1048  and Cys-1115,  between Cys-1390  and Cys1396, between Cys-1459 and Cys-1464, between Cys-1521 and Cys-1525, between Cys-1590  and Cys-1595,  between Cys-1646  and Cys-1653,  and between Cys-1729  and Cys-1733 (numbering of preproPAPP-A2, as in Figure 1 and 3).</p><p>Pharmaceutical Compositions
Identification of PAPP-A2 as the IGFBP-5  protease provides methods for affecting growth and differentiation in vivo by using PAPP-A2 as a therapeutic target.</p><p>Inhibitors of PAPP-A2 is believed to decrease the amount of bioavailable IGF-I  and IGF-II.  For example, inhibition of PAPP-A2 activity can be useful in disorders such as restenosis, atherosclerosis, and fibrosis. Activators, or agents that increase the activity of PAPP-A2, is believed to increase the amount of bioavailable IGF-I  and IGF-II. </p><p>Agents that alter PAPP-A2 activity or that alter adherence of PAPP-A2 to cell surfaces can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions. Such agents may be incorporated together with agents that alter PAPP-A activity or that alter adherence of PAPP-A to cell surfaces. A combination of PAPP-A2  specific agents and PAPP-A specific agents may be more effective than traditional agents directed against PAPP-A. There is also provided a method of treatment comprising the step of administreing to an individual in need thereof a combination of PAPP-A2 specific agents and PAPP-A specific agents in pharmaceutically  effective amounts.</p><p>As an example, an antibody such as anti-PAPP-A2 polyclonal or monoclonal, can be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition by admixture with pharmaceutically  acceptable non-toxic excipients or carriers. Such compounds and compositions may be prepared for parenteral administration, particularly in the form of liquid solutions or suspensions in aqueous physiological buffer solutions; for oral administration, particularly in the form of tablets or capsules; or for intranasal administration, particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols. Compositions for other routes of administration may be prepared as desired using standard methods.</p><p>Formulations for parenteral administration may contain as common excipients (i. e., pharmaceutically acceptable carriers) sterile water or saline, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, hydrogenated naphthalenes, and the like. In particular, biocompatible, biodegradable lactide  polymer, lactide/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers are examples of excipients for controlling the release of a compound of the invention in vivo. Other suitable parenteral delivery systems include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposoms.</p><p>Formulations for inhalation administration may contain excipients such as lactose, if desired. Inhalation formulations may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or they may be oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops. If desired, the compounds can be formulated as gels to be applied intranasally. Formulations for parenteral administration may also include glycocholate for buccal administration
Medical Devices
The invention also features a medical device for placement in a patient (e. g., an implant) that includes an agent that inhibits or activates PAPP-A2 protease activity.</p><p>Suitable agents are readily identified using the methods described herein. The device can be impregnated with the agent or can be coated with the agent. Nonlimiting examples of inhibitors include an antibody such as anti-PAPP-A2 polyclonal or monoclonal, or a metalloprotease  inhibitor such as 1,10-phenanthroline.</p><p> IGFBP-5  protease activity of PAPP-A2 is potently inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, but is not inhibited by tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases (TIMP'S).  Other inhibitors include small molecules such as derivatives of hydroxamic acid. Anti
PAPP-A2 polyclonal  IgG  may also inhibit IGF-dependent-or IGF-independent IGFBP-5  specific PAPP-A2 protease activity in HFCM in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p>In addition, polypeptides (i. e., any chain of amino acids, regardless of length or posttranslational modification), including modified polypeptides, can function as inhibitors. Any inhibitor of the IGFBP-5  protease activity of PAPP-A2 can be used for coating or impregnating a medical device according to the invention. Modified polypeptides include amino acid substitutions, deletions, or insertions in the amino acid sequence as compared with a corresponding wild-type sequence, as well as chemical modifications. Although protease-resistant IGFBP-5  is not an inhibitor per se of the IGFBP-5  protease activity of PAPP-A2, similar results are expected when it is used for coating or impregnating a medical device. </p><p>As an example, coating or impregnating the medical device with a PAPP-A2 inhibitor, optionally in combination with a PAPP-A inhibitor, can help prevent the development of restenosis following balloon angioplasty, or can prevent a further increase in size of an atherosclerotic plaque. Coronary angioplasty with stent placement is currently the leading therapeutic approach for coronary atherosclerosis. An important goal of angioplasty of coronary artery disease is to prevent both acute and chronic complications. Modern procedures are quite successful in eliminating immediate problems. Unfortunately, restenosis still occurs in 20-30% of stented patients. No known pharmacological intervention is available to prevent the restenosis.</p><p>Without being bound by a particular mechanism, it is thought that an increase in IGFBP-5  protease expression by coronary smooth muscle cells precedes neointimal formation in response to angioplasty in humans.</p><p>For example, enhanced PAPP-A2 activity can be useful for wound healing, fractures, osteoporosis, or ovulation. Osteoporosis or other conditions of bone loss may benefit from increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption. Agents that enhance PAPP-A2 activity can be, for example, a modified IGF,  i. e., an IGF analog.</p><p>Analogs include IGF  polypeptides containing amino acid insertions, deletions or substitutions, as well as chemical modifications. Amino acid substitutions can include conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions replace an amino acid with an amino acid of the same class, whereas non-conservative amino acid substitutions replace an amino acid with an amino acid of a different class. Non-conservative substitutions result in a change in the hydrophobicity of the polypeptide or in the bulk of a residue side chain. In addition, non-conservative substitutions can make a substantial change in the charge of the polypeptide, such as reducing electropositive charges or introducing electronegative charges. Examples of non-conservative substitutions include a basic amino acid for a non-polar amino acid, or a polar amino acid for an acidic amino acid. Amino acid insertions, deletions and substitutions can be made using random mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis, or other recombinant techniques known in the art. </p><p>The medical device can be, for example, bone plates or bone screws that are used to stabilize bones, or a stent, which typically is used within the body to restore or maintain the patency of a body lumen. Blood vessels, for example, can become obstructed due to an atherosclerotic plaque that restricts the passage of blood. A stent typically has a tubular structure defining an inner channel that accommodates flow within the body lumen. The outer walls of the stent engage the inner walls of the body lumen. Positioning of a stent within an affected area can help prevent further occlusion of the body lumen and permit continued flow. A stent typically is deployed by percutaneous insertion of a catheter or guide wire that carries the stent.</p><p>The stent ordinarily has an expandable structure. Upon delivery to the desired site, the stent can be expanded with a balloon mounted on the catheter. Alternatively, the stent may have a biased or elastic structure that is held within a sheath or other restraint in a compressed state. The stent expands voluntarily when the restraint is removed. In either case, the walls of the stent expand to engage the inner wall of the body lumen, and generally fix the stent in a desired position.</p><p>STATEMENTS OF INVENTION

There is also provided a polynucleotide, the complementary strand of which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, with a polynucleotide according to the invention.</p><p>Stringent conditions as used herein shall denote stringency as normally applied in connection with Southern blotting and hybridization as described e. g. by <bibl next="bibl35" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Southern E. M., 1975, J. Mol. Biol. 98: 503-517</bibl>. For such purposes it is routine practise to include steps of prehybridization and hybridization. Such steps are normally performed using solutions containing 6x SSPE, 5% Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide, 100 ) lg/ml den turated salmon  testis DNA (incubation for 18 hrs at 42 C),  followed by washings with 2x SSC and 0.5% SDS (at room temperature and at 37 C),  and a washing with 0.1x SSC and 0.5% SDS (incubation at 68 C  for 30 min), as described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sambrook et al.,  1989, in"Molecular Cloning/A  Laboratory Manual", Cold Spring
Harbor</bibl>), which is incorporated herein by reference. </p><p>The DNA sequences are used in a variety of ways. They may be used as probes for identifying homologs of uHAse (e. g., homologs of huHAse). Mammalian homologs have substantial sequence similarity to one another, i. e. at least 75%, usually at least 90%,  more usually at least 95% sequence identity. Sequence similarity is cal culated  based on a reference sequence, which may be a subset of a larger sequence, such as a conserved motif, coding region, flanking region, etc. A reference sequence will usually be at least about 18 nt long, more usually at least about 30 nt long, and may extend to the complete sequence that is being compared. Algorithms for sequence analysis are known in the art, such as BLAST, described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Altschul et al. 1990 J Mol Biol 215: 403-10</bibl>.</p><p>Nucleic acids having sequence similarity are detected by hybridization under low stringency conditions, for example, at 50. degree. C. and 10.  times. SSC (0.9 M sa line/0.  09 M sodium citrate) and remain bound when subjected to washing at 55. degree. C. in 1.  times. SSC. Sequence identity may be determined by hybridization under high stringency conditions, for example, at 50. degree. C. or higher and 0.  1.  times. SSC (9 mM saline/0. 9 mM sodium citrate). By using probes, particularly labeled probes of DNA sequences, one can isolate homologous or related genes.</p><p>The source of homologous genes may be any species, e. g. Primate species, particularly human; rodents, such as rats and mice, canines, felines, bovine, opines, equine, yeast, Drosophila, Caenhorabditis, etc.</p><p>In a further embodiment there is provided a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence which is degenerate to a polynucleotide  capable of hybridising to SEQ ID
NO : 1, or a fragment thereof.</p><p>Degeneracy as used herein is defined in terms of the activity or functionality associated with the polypeptide expressed from said degenerate polynucleotide, said polynucleotide is either i) comprising a proteolytic activity specific at least for Insulin
Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5 (IGFBP-5)  ; and/or ii) recognised by an antibody, or a binding fragment thereof, which is capable of recognising a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO : 2; and/or iii) competing with a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO : 2 for binding to a cell surface receptor having an affinity for said polypeptide. </p><p>In a further embodiment there is provided a polynucleotide comprising the complementary strand of a polynucleotide according to the invention.</p><p>The polynucleotide according to the invention may be operably linked to a further polynucleotide comprising nucleic acid residues corresponding to the 3'untranslated region of PAPP-A2, or a fragment thereof. As used herein the 3'untranslated region comprises nucleic acid residues 5377 to 8527 of SEQ ID NO : 1. </p><p>There is also provided a recombinant DNA molecule in the form of an expression vector comprising an expression signal operably linked to a polynucleotide according to the invention.</p><p>In a further embodiment there is provided a host organism transfected or transformed with the polynucleotide according to the invention, or the vector according to the invention. The host organism is preferably a mammalian organism such as e. g. a mammalian cell line. However, a microbial eukaryote such as yeast or fungi may also be used, as may a microbial prokaryote such as Bacillus or E. coli. The person skilled in the art will know how to select expression signals, including leader sequences and/or signal peptides suitable for expression in a given cell. The person skilled in the art will also know how to determine the level of expression in a given cell by using standard molecular biology techniques.</p><p>In a further aspect the invention relates to an isolated polypeptide comprising or essentially consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO : 2, or a fragment thereof, wherein said fragment a) has a proteolytic activity specific at least for Insulin. Like Growth Factor
Binding Protein 5 (IGFBP-5)  ; and/or b) is recognised by an antibody, or a binding fragment thereof, which is capable of recognising a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence as shown in
SEQ ID NO : 2; and/or c) competes with a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence as shown in
SEQ ID NO : 2 for binding to a cell surface receptor with an affinity for said polypeptide.</p><p>In one preferred embodiment of the invention there is also provided variants of SEQ ID N0 :  2, and variants of fragments thereof. Variants are determined on the basis of their degree of identity or their homology with a predetermined amino acid sequence, said predetermined amino acid sequence being SEQ ID NO : 2, or, when the variant is a fragment, a fragment of SEQ ID NO : 2.</p><p>Accordingly, variants preferably have at least 75% sequence identity, for example at least 80% sequence identity, such as at least 85 % sequence identity, for example at least 90 % sequence identity, such as at least 91 % sequence identity, for example at least 91 % sequence identity, such as at least 92 % sequence identity, for example at least 93 % sequence identity, such as at least 94 % sequence identity, for example at least 95 % sequence identity, such as at least 96 % sequence identity, for example at least 97% sequence identity, such as at least 98 % sequence identity, for example 99% sequence identity with the predetermined sequence.</p><p>Variants are also determined based on a predetermined number of conservative amino acid substitutions as defined herein below. Conservative amino acid substitu-  tion as used herein relates to the substitution of one amino acid (within a predetermined group of amino acids) for another amino acid (within the same group), wherein the amino acids exhibit similar or substantially similar characteristics.</p><p>Within the meaning of the term"conservative amino acid substitution"as applied herein, one amino acid may be substituted for another within the groups of amino acids indicated herein below : i) Amino acids having polar side chains (Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg, His, Asn, Gln, Ser,
Thr, Tyr, and Cys,) ii) Amino acids having non-polar side chains (Gly,  Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, Trp,
Pro, and Met) iii) Amino acids having aliphatic side chains (Gly, Ala Val, Leu, lle)  iv) Amino acids having cyclic side chains (Phe, Tyr, Trp, His, Pro) v)  Amino acids having aromatic side chains (Phe, Tyr, Trp) vi) Amino acids having acidic side chains (Asp, Glu) vii) Amino acids having basic side chains (Lys, Arg, His) viii) Amino acids having amide side chains (Asn, Gln) ix) Amino acids having hydroxy side chains (Ser, Thr) x)  Amino acids having sulphor-containing side chains (Cys, Met), xi) Neutral, weakly hydrophobic amino acids (Pro, Ala, Gly, Ser, Thr) xii) Hydrophilic, acidic amino acids (Gln,  Asn, Glu, Asp), and xiii) Hydrophobic amino acids (Leu,  Ile,  Val)
Accordingly, a variant or a fragment thereof according to the invention may comprise, within the same variant of the sequence or fragments thereof, or among different variants of the sequence or fragments thereof, at least one substitution, such as a plurality of substitutions introduced independently of one another.</p><p>It is clear from the above outline that the same variant or fragment thereof may comprise more than one conservative amino acid substitution from more than one group of conservative amino acids as defined herein above.</p><p>The addition or deletion of an amino acid may be an addition or deletion of from 2 to 10 amino acids, such as from 10 to 20 amino acids, for example from 20 to 30 amino acids, such as from 40 to 50 amino acids. However, additions or deletions of more than 50 amino acids, such as additions from 10 to 100 amino acids, addition of 100 to 150 amino acids, addition of 150-250 amino acids, are also comprised within the present invention.</p><p>The polypeptide fratments according to the present invention, including any functional equivalents thereof, may in one embodiment comprise less than 250 amino acid residues, such as less than 240 amino acid residues, for example less than 225 amino acid residues, such as less than 200 amino acid residues, for example less than 180 amino acid residues, such as less than 160 amino acid residues, for example less than 150 amino acid residues, such as less than 140 amino acid residues, for example less than 130 amino acid residues, such as less than 120 amino acid residues, for example less than 110 amino acid residues, such as less than 100 amino acid residues, for example less than 90 amino acid residues, such as less than 85 amino acid residues, for example less than 80 amino acid residues, such as less than 75 amino acid residues, for example less than 70 amino acid residues, such as less than 65 amino acid residues, for example less than 60 amino acid residues, such as less than 55 amino acid residues, for example less than 50  amino acid residues.</p><p> "Functional equivalency"as used in the present invention is according to one preferred embodiment established by means of reference to the corresponding functionality of a predetermined fragment of the sequence. More specifically, functional equivalency is to be understood as the ability of a polypeptide fragment to exert IGFBP-5 specific protease activity and/or to be recognised by an antibody capable of recognising PAPP-A2 and/or to compete with PAPP-A2 for binding to a receptor having affinity for PAPP-A2.</p><p>Functional equivalents or variants of PAPP-A2 will be understood to exhibit amino acid sequences gradually differing from the preferred predetermined PAPP-A2 sequence, as the number and scope of insertions, deletions and substitutions including conservative substitutions increases. This difference is measured as a reduction in homology between the preferred predetermined sequence and the fragment or functional equivalent. </p><p>All fragments or functional equivalents of SEQ ID NO : 2 are included within the scope of this invention, regardless of the degree of homology that they show to a preferred predetermined sequence of PAPP-A2 as reported herein. The reason for this is that some regions of PAPP-A2 are most likely readily mutatable, or capable of being completely deleted, without any significant effect on the binding activity of the resulting fragment.</p><p>A functional variant obtained by substitution may well exhibit some form or degree of native PAPP-A2 activity, and yet be less homologous, if residues containing functionally similar amino acid side chains are substituted. Functionally similar in this respect refers to dominant characteristics of the side chains such as hydrophobic, basic, neutral or acidic, or the presence or absence of steric bulk. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, the degree of identity is not a principal measure of a fragment being a variant or functional equivalent of a preferred predetermined fragment according to the present invention.</p><p>The homology between amino acid sequences may be calculated using well known algorithms such as BLOSUM 30, BLOSUM 40,  BLOSUM 45, BLOSUM 50,
BLOSUM 55, BLOSUM 60, BLOSUM 62, BLOSUM 65, BLOSUM 70, BLOSUM 75,
BLOSUM 80, BLOSUM 85, or BLOSUM 90. </p><p>Fragments sharing at least some homology with fragments of SEQ ID NO : 2 are to be considered as falling within the scope of the present invention when they are at least about 90 percent homologous, for example at least 92 percent homologous, such as at least 94 percent homologous, for example at least 95 percent homologous, such as at least 96 percent homologous, for example at least 97 percent homologous, such as at least 98 percent homologous, for example at least 99 percent homologous with said fragments of SEQ ID NO : 2. According to one embodiment of the invention the homology percentages refer to identity percentages.</p><p>Additional factors that may be taken into consideration when determining functional equivalence according to the meaning used herein are i) the ability of antisera to detect a PAPP-A2 fragment according to the present invention, or ii) the ability of the functionally equivalent PAPP-A2 fragment to compete with PAPP-A2 in a binding assay. One method of determining a sequence of immunogenically  active amino acids within a known amino acid sequence has been described by Geysen in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 5,595,915</bibl> and is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>A further suitably adaptable method for determining structure and function relationships of peptide fragments is described by <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 6,013,478</bibl>, which is herein incorporated by reference. Also, methods of assaying the binding of an amino acid sequence to a receptor moiety are known to the skilled artisan.</p><p>Conservative substitutions may be introduced in any position of a preferred predetermined fragment of SEQ ID NO : 2, and it may also be desirable to introduce non-conservative substitutions in any one or more positions.</p><p>A non-conservative substitution leading to the formation of a functionally equivalent fragment of PAPP-A2 would for example i) differ substantially in polarity, for example a residue with a non-polar side chain (Ala, Leu, Pro, Trp, Val, live,  Leu, Phe or Met) substituted for a residue with a polar side chain such as Gly, Ser, Thr, Cys,
Tyr, Asn, or Gln or a charged amino acid such as Asp, Glu, Arg, or Lys, or substituting a charged or a polar residue for a non-polar one; and/or  ii) differ substantially in its effect on polypeptide backbone orientation such as substitution of or for Pro or Gly by another residue; and/or iii) differ substantially in electric charge, for example substitution of a negatively charged residue such as Glu or Asp for a positively charged residue such as Lys, His or Arg (and vice versa); and/or iv) differ substantially in steric bulk, for example substitution of a bulky residue such as His,
Trp, Phe or Tyr for one having a minor side chain, e. g. Ala, Gly  or Ser (and vice versa).</p><p>Variants obtained by substitution of amino acids may in one preferred embodiment be made based upon the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity values and the relative similarity of the amino acid side-chain substituents, including charge, size, and the like. Exemplary amino acid substitutions which take various of the foregoing characteristics into consideration are well known to those of skill in the art and include: arginine and lysine ; glutamate and aspartate; serine and threonine; glutamin and asparagine; and valine, leucine and isoleucine. </p><p>In addition to the variants described herein, sterically similar variants may be formulated to mimic the key portions of the variant structure and that such compounds may also be used in the same manner as the variants of the invention.</p><p>This may be achieved by techniques of modelling and chemical designing known to those of skill in the art. It will be understood that all such sterically similar constructs fall within the scope of the present invention.</p><p>In a further embodiment the present invention relates to functional comprising substituted amino acids having hydrophilic or hydropathic indices that are within +/-2.5, for example within +/-2.3, such as within +/-2.1, for example within +/-2.0, such as within +/-1.8, for example within +/-1.6, such as within +/-1.5, for example within +/-1.  4, such as within +/-1.3 for example within +/-1.2, such as within +/-1.1, for example within +/-1.0, such as within +/-0.9, for example within +/-0.8, such as within +/-0.7, for example within +/-0.6, such as within +/-0.5, for example within +/-0.4, such as within +/-0.3, for example within +/-0.25, such as within +/-0.2 of the value of the amino acid it has substituted.</p><p>The importance of the hydrophilic and hydropathic amino acid indices in conferring interactive biologic  function on a protein is well understood in the art (Kyte &amp; Doolittle, 1982 and Hopp, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. Pat. No. 4,554,101</bibl>, each incorporated herein by reference).</p><p>The amino acid hydropathic index values as used herein are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine  (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.  5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.  8); glycine (-0.4); threonine (-0.7); serine (-0.8); tryptophan (0.9); tyrosine (-1.3); proline  (-1.6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate (-3.5); glutamin (-3.5); aspartate (-3.5); asparagine (-3.5); lysine (-3.9); and arginine (-4.5) (Kyte &amp;  Doolittle,  1982).</p><p>The amino acid hydrophilicity values are: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0. +-. 1) ;  glutamate (+3.0. +-. 1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamin (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (-0.4); proline (-0.5. +-. 1); alanine (-0.5); histidine (-0.5); cysteine (-1.0); methionine (-1.3); valine (-1.5); leucine (-1.8); isoleucine (-1.8); tyrosine (-2.3); phenylalanine  (-2.5); tryptophan (-3.4) (<bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U. S. 4,554,101</bibl>). </p><p>In addition to the peptidyl compounds described herein, sterically similar compounds may be formulated to mimic the key portions of the peptide structure and that such compounds may also be used in the same manner as the peptides of the invention.</p><p>This may be achieved by techniques of modelling and chemical designing known to those of skill in the art. For example, esterification and other alkylations may be employed to modify the amino terminus of, e. g., a di-arginine peptide backbone, to mimic a tetra peptide structure. It will be understood that all such sterically similar constructs fall within the scope of the present invention.</p><p>Peptides with N-terminal alkylations and C-terminal esterifications are also encompassed within the present invention. Functional equivalents also comprise glycosylated and covalent or aggregative conjugates formed with the same or other PAPP
A2 fragments and/or PAPP-A2 molecules, including dimers or unrelated chemical moieties. Such functional equivalents are prepared by linkage of functionalities to groups which are found in fragment including at any one or both of the N-and Ctermini, by means known in the art.</p><p>Functional equivalents may thus comprise fragments conjugated to aliphatic or acyl esters or amides of the carboxyl terminus, alkylamines or residues containing carboxyl side chains, e. g., conjugates to alkylamines at aspartic acid residues; O-acyl derivatives of hydroxyl group-containing residues and N-acyl derivatives of the amino terminal amino acid or amino-group containing residues, e. g. conjugates with fMet-Leu-Phe or immunogenic proteins.

The reactive groups preferably are difunctional compounds known per se for use in cross-linking proteins to insoluble matrices through reactive side groups.</p><p>Covalent or aggregative functional equivalents and derivatives thereof are useful as reagents in immunoassays or for affinity purification procedures. For example, a fragment of PAPP-A2-according to the present invention may be insolubilized by'co-  valent bonding to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose by methods known per se or adsorbed to polyolefin surfaces, either with or without glutaraldehyde  crosslinking, for use in an assay or purification of anti-PAPP-A2 antibodies or cell surface receptors.

Figure 1 shows the cDNA  sequence (in 5'-43'orientation)  corresponding to the mRNA  that encodes preproPAPP-A2. Only the coding part of the sequence and the terminal stop codon (*) is shown and is numbered 1-5376. The translated polypetide sequence of preproPAPP-A2 is also shown. The signal peptide cleavage site was predicted using SignalP  V2.0 to be after the alanine residue encoded by nt. 64 66 ( <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Nie) sen  et al.,  1997, Protein Eng 10,1-6</bibl>), WWW prediction server is located at http ://genome. cbs. dtu. dkl).  The signal peptide of preproPAPP-A2 (nt. 1-66,22 residues) is shown in bold. The nucleotide sequence of this figure represents nt. 1 to 5376 of SEQ ID NO : 1.  The protein sequence of this figure is illustrated as SEQ ID
NO : 2.</p><p>Figure 2 is a schematic drawing of the relationship between PAPP-A (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kristensen et al.,  1994, Biochemistry 33,1592-8</bibl>), and sequence stretches contained within two genomic clones with homology to the N-terminal end (hom-N, coding portion of accession number AL031734) and the C-terminal end (hom-C, coding portion of accession number AL031290) of PAPP-A, when translated into amino acid sequence.</p><p>This figure also illustrates the method by which a cDNA  sequence with homology to the midregion of PAPP-A was obtained. Hom-N, hom-C, and the midregion together encodes the complete sequence of a novel protein, PAPP-A2, which is a homolog of
PAPP-A. The midregion was obtained by PCR using specifically primed (primer RT
N-mid), reversed transcribed human placenta mRNA  as the template, and primers
PR-mid5 and PR-mid3 for the PCR (Table 1). To obtain a cDNA  construct encoding the full-length PAPP-A2, cDNA  clones corresponding to the genomic clones hom-N and hom-C were also obtained using cDNA  synthesized with specifically primed placental mRNA  as the template (primers not shown, see Table 1). This required identification of a signal peptide stretch (in hom-N) and a stop codon (at the 3'end of hom-C), as detailed in the main text. All primers used are shown in Table 1. Note:
The relative positions of the sequences depicted here are in accordance with the experiments performed, but the figure is not accurately drawn to scale.</p><p>Figure 3 shows the amino acid sequence of preproPAPP-A2 (SEQ ID NO : 2) aligned with preproPAPP-A. The deduced amino acid sequence of preproPAPP-A2 (PA2) was aligned with the sequence of preproPAPP-A (PA) ( (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Haaning  et al.,  1996, Eur J
Biochem 237,159-63</bibl>), AAC50543)  using CLUSTAL W (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Thompson et al.,  1994, Nucleic Acids Res 22,4673-80</bibl>). Because the prepro-portion of PAPP-A did not show significant identity with the corresponding region of PAPP-A2, the alignment was manually adjusted to emphasize difference in length of pro-peptides. Arrows indicate the N-termini of the mature proteins as found earlier for PAPP-A (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kristensen et al.,  1994, Biochemistry 33,1592-8</bibl>) (Glu-81),  and here for PAPP-A2 (Ser-234). Putative signal peptides, strongly predicted using SignalP  V2.0 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nielsen  et al.,  1997, Protein 
Eng 10,1-6</bibl>) are shown with lower case letters. The pro-portion of PAPP-A2 contains one other candidate initiation codon corresponding to Met-168,  but no signal peptide was predicted following this residue using SignalP.  The sequence motifs of
PAPP-A (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kristensen et al.,  1994, Biochemistry 33,1592-8</bibl>) are also found in PAPP
A2: The catalytic zinc binding motif and residues of-the putative Met-turn are underlined and bolded in both sequences. Lin-notch motifs (LNR1-3)  and short consensus repeats (SCR-1-5) are boxed. Cysteine residus are shaded. All cysteines of mature
PAPP-A are also found in PAPP-A2. In addition, the secreted form of PAPP-A2 has four cysteine residues (Cys-343, Cys-533, Cys-618, and Cys-1268) with no counterpart in PAPP-A.</p><p>Figure 4 shows PAPP-A2 by Western blotting and Coomassie staining. Medium from trarisfected  293T cells was Western blotted using monoclonal anti-c-myc. Lane 1, cells transfected with empty vector; lane 2, cells transfected with cDNA  encoding wild-type PAPP-A2 C-terminally tagged with the c-myc peptide (pPA2-mH), nonreduced; lane 3, cells transfected with or cDNA  encoding PAPP-A2 with an inactivating E734Q mutation (pPA2-KO-mH), non-reduced ; lane 4, as lane 2, but reduced. Recombinant PAPP-A2 was purified by nickel affinity chromatography from serum free medium of cells transfected with pPA2-KO-mH,  to eliminate possible autocatalysis (lane 5, reduced).</p><p>Figure 5 shows the activity of PAPP-A2 against BP-1-6.  Medium from 293T cells transfected with empty vector (-), or cDNA  encoding PAPP-A2 (pPA2) (+) was incubated with each of the six IGFBPs (BP1-BP6), and the activity was assessed by ligand blotting using radiolabeled IGF-II.  Complete cleavage of IGFBP-5  is evident from the absence of a signal in the BP5+ lane. Partial degradation of IGFBP-3  is also evident.</p><p>Figure 6 shows proteolytic activity of PAPP-A2 against IGFBP-5.  Medium from 293T cells transfected with empty vector (lane 1), cDNA  encoding PAPP-A2 with an inactivating E734Q mutation (pPA2-KO) (lane 2), or cDNA  encoding wild-type PAPP-A2 (pPA2) (lanes 3-6) was incubated with C-terminally c-myc  tagged rlGFBP-5.  Proteolytic activity was assessed by Western blotting using anti-c-myc.'i'denotes  intact rlGFBP-5  ;'c'denotes  the detectable C-terminal c-myc tagged cleavage product. In the absence of inhibitors, wild-type PAPP-A2 degraded all rlGFBP-5 (lane  3). The 
PAPP-A2 activity was abolished by 10 mM phenantroline (lane 4) and 5 mM EDTA (lane 5), but  not affected by 100, uM 3, 4-DCI (lane  6). Coomassie-stained SDS
PAGE of purified rlGFBP-5  is shown before (lane 7) and after (lane 8) digestion with purified PAPP-A2. A Western blot of the same digest, using anti-c-myc, is also shown (lane 9). Sequence analysis revealed that PAPP-A2 cleaves IGFBP-5  at one site, between Ser-142 and Lys-143.</p><p>Figure 7 shows the cDNA  sequence of the PAPP-A2 mRNA  coding region directly followed by the sequence of the 3'UTR. The sequence of the 3'UTR was obtained as detailed in Example 6.3 The first 5376 nucleotides of this sequence (nt. 1-5376) represents the coding sequence as illustrated in Figure 1 and SEQ ID NO : 1  (nt. 15376). Nucleotides 5377-8527 of this sequence corresponds to the 3'UTR of the
PAPP-A2 mRNA  as illustrated in SEQ ID NO : 3 (nt. 5377-8527).</p><p>Figure 8 shows the disulfide structure of the PAPP-A subunit in the PAPP-A/proMBP complex (upper bar). Cysteine containing peptides originating from the PAPP
A/proMBP complex were isolated by degrading PAPP-A/proMBP complex with proteinases and cyanogen bromide followed by standard HPLC. Peptides were identified by amino acid analysis, N-terminal sequence analysis, and by mass spectrometry (Overgaard, M. T., Oxvig, C., unpublished). Disulfide bonds are shown by thin lines. Two cysteine residues form inter-chain disulfide bridges to proMBP, and one forms an inter-chain bridge to PAPP-A causing it to be a dimer (as indicated).</p><p>Asterisks mark a cysteine residue to which no partner has been found. The cysteine residues present in mature PAPP-A is also present in mature PAPP-A2 (see Figure 3). It is reasonable to assume that the disulfide pairing of PAPP-A2 is the same.</p><p>Thus, this information is valuable in determination of boundary regions for expression of isolated domains (fragments) of PAPP-A2. The gene structure of PAPP-A is also show (lower bar). Exon/intron  boundaries are based on comparison of PAPP-A cDNA  (AN X68280) with genomic sequences (ANs AB020878, AL353141, and AL137024).  The central bar shows putative domains of PAPP-A based on information of the upper and lower bars. </p><p>EXAMPLES 6.1. Identification of a nucleotide sequence encoding PAPP-A2

A ((<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kristensen et al.,  1994, Biochemistry 33,1592-8</bibl>), AN CAA48341) when translated into polypeptide sequence revealed two genomic clones with the ANs
AL031734 and AL031290. Both originate from the human chromosome 1 (1 q24).</p><p>The search was performed against the"nr"collection of databases using the pro gram tblastn at http ://www. ncbi. nim. nih. gov/BLAST/ with default settings. In this ex-  ample, PAPP-A is numbered with the N-terminal Glu as residue 1, as in (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kristensen et al.,  1994, Biochemistry 33,1592-8</bibl>). In the deposited sequence record (AN X68280)  this Glu is residue 5.</p><p>The sequence reported in AL031734 contains 168835 base pairs. Two noncontiguous sequence stretches (nt. 103432-103566, and 140846-141919) of the total sequence together aligned with residues 16-59, and 59-413 of the PAPP-A polypetide sequence when translated. The sequence reported in AL031290 contains
121780 base pairs. Four noncontiguous sequence stretches (nt. 10209-10358,
11752-11901,20531-20463, and 60536-60652) of the total sequence together aligned with residues 1313-1362,1376-1425,1457-1479, and 1. 470-1506 of the 
PAPP-A polypeptide sequence when translated. The sequence stretches between the coding regions of both of the genomic sequences represent noncoding genomic
 DNA (introns) or coding regions that do not align.</p><p> Based on these findings, we hypothesized the existence of a novel protein, PAPP
A2, with homology to PAPP-A. It was then established the complete coding se quence of the regions of PAPP-A2 that were partially covered by the two genomic sequences reported in AL031734 and AL031290. We denote those contiguous sequences hom-N and hom-C, respectively (Figure 2). But first, we established the existence of a coding cDNA  sequence that also showed homology to PAPP-A, and that connected the sequence of hom-N and hom-C (Figure 2). All essential primers used are described in Table 1. The entire cDNA  sequence encoding the 1791residue preproPAPP-A2 is shown in Figure 1. Standard cloning techniques were used, and all DNA constructs were analyzed by sequencing. The methodology used is described below. The name PAPP-A2 is used for the protein encoded by this DNA sequence.</p><p>Cloning of a contiguous coding cDNA  stretch corresponding to the midregion between hom-N and hom-C: To obtain the midregion (Figure 2), cDNA  was synthesized using human placenta mRNA  as a template and a primer, RT-N-mid, derived from AL031290 (Table 1, Figure 2). This cDNA  was used as a template in a PCR to obtain a cDNA  corresponding to the midregion of the hypothesized PAPP-A2. PCR primers were PR-mid5 and PR-mid3 (Table 1, Figure 2). The coding sequence of the midregion obtained corresponds to residues 665-1572 of Figure 3 (SEQ ID

PAPP-A2 (hom-C): Searching available databases (using the program blastn at http  ://www. ncbi. nim.  nih. ov/BLAST/with default  settings) for human EST sequences matching the genomic sequence of AL031290 revealed an EST sequence overlapping with some of the coding regions of AL031290 already defined by the stretch nt. 60536-60652 (cf.  above). Nt. 62790-62995 of AL031290 also matched the sequence of the human EST sequence AA368081 originating from placenta.</p><p>When translated into polypeptide sequence, this EST sequence showed homology to the C-terminal end of PAPP-A. Further, a stop codon was present within the coding sequence corresponding to amino acid 1537 of PAPP-A. That is, PAPP-A2 does not extend C-terminally beyond PAPP-A when the two sequences are aligned.</p><p>Based on this, cDNA  was synthesized using human placental mRNA  as a template and a primer originating from AL031290 (Table 1). This cDNA  was used as a template in a PCR to obtain the contiguous cDNA  of hom-C using PCR primers PR-C5 and PR-C3 (Table 1, Figure 2). </p><p>All PCRs were carried out with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The three overlapping
PAPP-A2 cDNA  fragments (hom-N, the novel midregion, and hom-C) were all cloned into the vector pCR-Bluntll-TOPO (Invitrogen). Several clones were sequenced in both orientations. The constructs are referred to as p2N, p2Mid, and p2C, respectively. The entire nucleotide sequence encoding PAPP-A2 is shown in
Figure 1 (and SEQ ID. NO :  1).</p><p>6.2. Analyses of the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of PAPP-A2
Of the 1547 residues of mature PAPP-A, 708 residues (45.8%) are identical in preproPAPP-A2. There is no significant degree of identity between the prepro portion of
PAPP-A and the remaining (N-ternimal) portion of PAPP-A2 (Figure 3). In this example, PAPP-A is numbered according to ( (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Haaning  et al.,  1996, Eur J Biochem 237,159-63</bibl>), AAC50543).</p><p>The sequence motifs recognized in PAPP-A (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kristensen et al.,  1994, Biochemistrv 33,1592-8</bibl>) are also present PAPP-A2: An elongated zinc binding consensus sequence, three lin-notch repeats (LNR1-3),  and five short consensus repeats (SCR15) (Figure 3). Further, all 82 cysteine residues of PAPP-A are conserved between the two proteins, and an additional 4 cysteines are present in the PAPP-A2 polypetide sequence.</p><p>6.3. Identification of human EST sequences originating from the PAPP-A2 mRNA 
A cluster of EST sequences matching the genomic sequence of AL031290 were identified around nt 64000-66000 of AL031290, starting approximately 1.2 kb from the end of the PAPP-A2 encoding sequence. The existence of mRNA  connecting the coding region of PAPP-A2 and this cluster was verified in a PCR using primers from AL031290 (5'-GGAAAGAGCAGAGTTCACCCAT-3',  nt. 64900-64879  of
AL031290) and the PAPP-A2 encoding sequence (5'
CCGTCTTAGTCCACTGCATCC-3', nt. 20499-20519 of AL031290, nt 5171-5191 of
AF311940), and oligo-dT primed placenta cDNA  as a template (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Overgaard et al.,  1999, Biol Reprod 61,1083-9</bibl>). As expected, the size of the resulting product was 2.2 kb, further demonstrating the existence of a PAPP-A2 mRNA  with a 3'UTR of about 3 kb.  The distribution among tissues is shown in Table 2.</p><p>TABLE 2. Expression of PAPP-A2 mRNA  in human tissues evaluated by available

PAPP-A2 mRNA  sequence. The distribution among tissues is based on the annota tions of individual database entries (not listed). b EST sequences originated from pools of tissue, or from tissue represented by only one EST sequence.</p><p>6.4. Expression in mammalian cells of recombinant PAPP-A2 and variants of PAPP
A2
The following plasmid constructs were made: a) pPA2: The cDNA  sequence of pre-pro-PAPP-A2 encoding amino acids 1-1791 in expression vector pcDNA3.1 +. b) pPA2-KO: As pPA2, but Glu-734 of the active site of PAPP-A2 substituted with a
 Gln residue (E734Q). c) pPA2-mH: The expression vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (-) A containing the cDNA  sequence of pre-pro-PAPP-A2 encoding amino acids 1-1791, not followed by a stop codon, but rather a c-myc and a His tag. d) pPA2-KO-mH: As pPA2-mH, but with the E734Q substitution of pPA2-KO.</p><p> The three overlapping PAPP-A2 cDNA  fragments (hom-N, the midregion, and hom
 C) were used for the construction of a single contiguous cDNA  sequence encoding
PAPP-A2. The overlapping fragments were all contained in the vector pCR-Bluntll- 
 TOPO (Invitrogen)  and referred to as p2N, p2Mid, and p2C, as detailed above (ex ample 6.1). Clones of p2N and p2C were selected that had the proper orientation of the cDNA  insert.</p><p> Construction of pPA2: The Notl-BamHl fragment  was excised from p2C and cloned into pBluescriptilSK+  (Stratagene) to obtain p2CBlue. The Notl-Spel fragment was excised from p2N, and the Spel-Bcll fragment was excised from p2Mid. Those two fragments were ligated into the Notl/Bcil sites  of p2CBlue  in one reaction to obtain  p2NMidCBlue,  containing the entire PAPP-A2 cDNA.  The Notl-Apal fragment  of  pBluescriptilSK+  was excised and ligated into the NotllApal sites  of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) to obtain a modified version of this vector, pcDNA-NA. The full length cDNA  was then excised from p2NMidCBlue  with MoM  and Xhol and cloned into pcDNA-NA to obtain pPA2. All restriction sites used are in the multi cloning sites of the vectors, except for Spel and Bcll, both located in each of the two overlapping regions of the coding PAPP-A2 sequence stretches of p2N, p2Mid, and p2C (nt.  2365 and nt. 4203, respectively, of Figure 3).</p><p> Construction of pPA2-KO  : The construct pPA2-KO is a variant of the pPA2 expres sion construct in which residue Glu-734 of the active site of PAPP-A2 was substi tuted with a  Gln residue. Thus, the mutant is E734Q. The pPA2-KO construct was made by site directed mutagenesis using the method of overlap extension PCR (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ho et al.,  1989, Gene 77,51-9</bibl>) with pPA2 as the template. in brief, outer primers were  5'-CGCTCAGGGAAGGACAAGGG-3'  (5'end primer, nt. 976-995 of SEQ ID NO : 1)  and 5'-CTAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGGC-3'  (3'end primer, nt. 1040-1021, sequence of vector pcDNA3.1. +). Overlapping internal primers were 5'
TGTCCCACTTGATGGATCATGGTGTCGGTGTGG-3' (nt. 2210-2178 of SEQ ID 
NO : 1,  nt. 2200 not C, but G resulting in E734Q) and 5' CCATCAAGTGGGACATGTTCTGGGAC-3'  (nt. 2196-2221 of SEQ ID NO  : 1,  nt.</p><p>2200 not G, but C resulting in E734Q). The resulting mutated fragment was digested with Xbal and Xhol and  swapped into pPA2 to generate pPA2-KO. All PCRs were carried out with Pfu DNA polymerase  (Stratagene), and all constructs were verified by sequence analysis.</p><p>Construction of pPA2-mH: Two primers (5'-GAGGGCCTGTGGACCCAGGAG-3', nt. </p><p>4906-4926 of SEQ ID NO  : 1,  and 5'
GACGTAAAGCTTCTGATTTTCTTCTGCCTTGG-3', nt. 5373-5354 of SEQ ID NO  : 1,  preceded by a Hindlil  site, AAGCTT,  and nt. GACGTA to facilitate cleavage of the
PCR product) were used in a PCR with pPA2 as the template to generate a nucleotide fragment encoding the C-terminal 156 residues of PAPP-A2 with the stop codon replaced by a Hindlll site  for in-frame ligation to expression vector. In brief, the PCR product was digested with EcoRl and Hindlil and cloned  into the EcoRllHindlll sites  of the vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (-) A to generate pPA2C-mH. The Notl-Xbal frag-  ment (encoding the N-terminal portion of PAPP-A2), and the Xbal-EcoRl fragment  (encoding the remaining central portion of PAPP-A2) were excised from pPA2 and ligated in one reaction into the NotllEcoRl sites of pPA2C-mH. The resulting construct, pPA2-mH, encoded PAPP-A2 followed by residues KLGP, the myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL),  residues NSAVD, and six H-residues (amino acids are given as one letter code). A stop codon follows immediately after the six histidine residues.</p><p>Construction of pPA2-KO-mH  : A variant of pPA2-mH was constructed with residue Glu-734  substituted into a Gin residue: The Notl-Kpnl fragment of pPA2-KO was excised and swapped into the Notl-Kpnl sites of pPA2-mH, to generate pPA2-KO-mH.</p><p>Expression in mammalian cells : All constructs (pPA2, pPA2-KO, pPA2-mH, and pPA2-KO-mH) as well as empty expression vectors (pcDNA3.1+ and pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (-) A) were transiently  transfected into mammalian cells for expression of recombinant PAPP-A2 protein. Briefly, human embryonic kidney 293T cells (293tsA1609neo)  (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">DuBridge et al.,  1987, Mol Cell Biol 7,379-87</bibl>) were main tained in high glucose DMEM medium supplemented with 10%  fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and gentamicin (Life Technologies). Cells were plated onto 6 cm tissue culture dishes, and were transfected 18 h later by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Pear et al.,  1993, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 90, 8392-6</bibl>) using 10 ug of plasmid DNA prepared by QlAprep  Spin Kit (Qiagen). After a further 48 h the supernatants were harvested, and replaced by serum-free medium (293 SFM II,  Life Technologies) for another 48 h. The serum-free medium was harvested and cleared by centrifugation.</p><p>Analysis by Western blotting of recombinant protein resulting from transfection with the constructs pPA2-mH and pPA2-KO-mH, demonstrated that PAPP-A2 is secreted as a protein of 220 kDa (See Figure 2). Reduction of disulfide bonds did not cause a visible change in band migration. Thus, in contrast to PAPP-A, PAPP-A2 is secreted as a monomer.</p><p> 6.  5. Purification by affinity chromatography of tagged PAPP-A2
A metal chelate affinity colum  (2 mi,  Pharmacia) was charged with nickel ions and loaded with serum-free medium (50 ml)  from cells transiently  transfected with pPA2 KO-mH  (see example 6.4). After washing in PBS containing 1 M NaCI, bound protein was eluted with 10 mM EDTA in PBS in fractions of 0.5 ml. PAPP-A2 containing fractions were located by SDS-PAGE (Figure 4, lane 5). This protein was not seen from medium of cells transfected with empty vector (mock transfectants) and treated in a parallel manner.</p><p>6.6. N-terminal sequence analysis of PAPP-A2
C-terminally tagged PAPP-A2 purified from medium of cells transfected with construct pPA2-KO-mH (see examples 6.4 and 6.5) was reduced and run on a 10-20%
SDS gel, and further blotted onto PVDF membrane (ProBlott, Applied Biosystems).</p><p>Bands of 4 lanes were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis on an
Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer equipped with an on-line HPLC (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sottrup
Jensen, 1995, Anal Biochem 225,187-8</bibl>). The N-terminal sequence observed at a level of approximately 20 pmol was: Ser-Pro-Pro-Glu-Glu-Ser-Asn (SPPEESN), re sulting  from cleavage before Ser-234 of the PAPP-A2 polypeptide after R (230) VKK. </p><p>This confirms the prediction, that PAPP-A2, like PAPP-A, is synthesized as a prepro protein. The absence of an arginine residue in the P1 position, indicates that the proprotein processing enzyme responsible for this cleavage is not furin, but likely another proprotein  convertase (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nakayama, 1997, Biochem J 327,625-35</bibl>). Cleavage of proPAPP-A2 might have been predicted after R (196)  QRR, which archetypicaly markes furin cleavage (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nakayama, 1997, Biochem J 327, 625-35</bibl>).  We cannot exclude that cleavage occurred at this site, and that the observed N-terminus results from further processing.</p><p>6.7. Cleavage of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-5 
Ligand blotting (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Conover et al., 1993, J Clin Invest 91,  1129-37</bibl>) with radiolabeled IGF-II  (Bachem) was used to assay for activity against IGFBP-1  (from HepG2 conditioned medium), rlGFBP-2  (GroPep), rlGFBP-3  (gift of D. Powell), rlGFBP-4  (Austral), riGFBP-5 (gift of D. Andress), and rlGFBP-6 (Austral).  Of the six binding proteins, IGFBP-5 showed complete cleavage (Figure 5). IGFBP-3  was partially degraded (Figure 5). This cleavage was independent of the presence of IGF.  Experiments were carried out with media from cells transfected with pPA2 or empty vector.</p><p>For further analysis, recombinant IGFBP-5  was produced in mammalian cells. In brief, human placenta oligo-dT  primed cDNA  (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Overgaard et al.,  1999, Biol Reprod 61,1083-9</bibl>) was used as a template to amplify cDNA  encoding human IGFBP-5  (Accession number M65062). Specific primers containing an Xhol site (5'
TCCGCTCGAGATGGTGTTGCTCACCGCGGT-3') and a Hindlll site  (5' CGATAAGCTTCTCAACGTTGCTGCTGTCG-3')  were used, and the resulting PCR product was digested and cloned into the XhollHindlll sites of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His ( ) A (Invitrogen).  The construct encoded the full-length prolGFBP-5,  immediately followed by residues KLGP, the myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL),  residues NSAVD, and six H-residues (amino acids are given as one letter code). The construct was verified by sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared by QlAprep 
Spin Kit (Qiagen). Cell culture and expression of recombinant IGFBP-5  was performed as described above in Example 6.4. </p><p>Cleavage analysis was performed by Western blotting (Figure 6). Briefly, recombinant IGFBP-5  as contained in 5 microL  cell culture medium was incubated with culture supernatants (10 microL)  from cells transfected with pPA2, pPA2-KO,  or empty expression expression vectors (see example 6.4). Phosphate buffered saline was added to a final volume of 50 microL. After incubation at 37 degrees Celsius for 12 hours, 15 microL  of the reaction mixture was separated by reducing 16% SDS
PAGE, blotted onto a PVDF membrane, and the C-terminal cleavage product was detected with monoclonal anti-c-myc (clone 9E19,  ATTC) using peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies (P260, DAKO), and enhanced chemiluminescence  (ECL, Amersham).</p><p>6.8. Inhibition of the activity of PAPP-A2
Various agents were analyzed for their ability to inhibit the proteolytic activity of
PAPP-A2 against IGFBP-5. The experimental conditions were essentially as described in Example 6.7, except the agents to be tested were added (Figure 6).</p><p>Agents found to have no effect on the proteolytic activity of PAPP-A2 further included PMSF and aprotinin.</p><p>6.9. Identification of the cleavage site in IGFBP-5 
For cleavage site determination, purified rlGFBP-5  (Fig. 6, lane 7) was digested with purified PAPP-A2 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6, lane 8). Edman degradation of blotted material showed that both distinct, visible degradation products (fig. 6, lane 8) contained the N-terminal sequence K (144) FVGGA (IGFBP-5  is numbered with the N-terminal Leu of the mature protein as residue 1). The two bands both represent intact C-terminal cleavage fragments, because they also contain the Cterminal c-myc tag (Fig. 6, lane 9) ; they are likely to be differently glycosylated, in accordance with the heterogeneity of purified rlGFBP-5  (Figure 6, lane 7). Both bands contained a second sequence at lower level (45%), L (1) GXFVH, corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of IGFBP-5, The absence of Ser, expected in the third cycle, was taken as evidence for carbohydrate substitution of Ser-3. Olinked glycan on the N-terminal cleavage fragment is likely to cause it to smear around the two distinct, C-terminal fragments. Sequence analysis on the reaction mixture ( &gt; 100 pmol)  without SDS-PAGE separation showed only the same two IGFBP-5  sequences in equimolar amounts. Thus, PAPP-A2 cleaves IGFBP-5  at one site, between Ser-143 and Lys-144.</p><p>6.10. Tissues where PAPP-A2 may cause proteolysis of IGFBP-5
Proteolyctic activity against IGFBP-5  has been widely reported from several sources, e. g. pregnancy serum (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Claussen et al.,  1994, Endocrinolog 134,  1964-6</bibl>), seminal plasma (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lee et al.,  1994, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 79,1367-72</bibl>), culture media from smooth muscle cells (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Imai et al.,  1997, J Clin Invest 100,2596-605</bibl>), granulosa  cells (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Resnick et al.,  1998, Endocrinology  139, 1249-57</bibl>), osteosarcoma cells (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Conover and Kiefer, 1993, J  Clin Endocrinol Metab 76,1153-9</bibl>), and also from osteoblasts (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Thrailkill et al.,  1995, Endocrinology  136, 3527-33</bibl>), and fibroblasts (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Busby et al.,  2000, J Biol Chem</bibl>). In general, the proteinase responsible for cleavage of IGFBP-5  has remained unidentified.</p><p>The recent identification of PAPP-A as the IGFBP-4 proteinase in fibroblasts  and osteoblasts (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lawrence et al.,  1999, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 96,3149-53</bibl>), ovarian follicular fluid (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Conover et al.,  1999, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 84,4742-5</bibl>), pregnancy serum (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Overgaard et al.,  2000, J Biol Chem</bibl>),  and vascular smooth muscle cells (Bayes-Genis, A., Schwartz, R. S., Ashai, K., Lewis, D. A., Overgaard, M. T., Christiansen, M., Oxvig, C., Holmes, D. R., Jr., and Conover, C. A. Arterioscler. Thromb.</p><p>Vasc. Biol.,  in press) firmly establishes PAPP-A and IGFBP-4  as an important functional pair in several systems. No other substrate as has been found for PAPP-A, and no other proteinase has been shown to cleave IGFBP-4  physiologically. It is therefore likely that the pair of PAPP-A2 and IGFBP-5  plays an analogous role in a number of the tissues mentioned above and/or elsewhere. Interestingly, incubating IGFBP-5  with smooth muscle cells conditioned medium resulted in cleavage between Ser-143 and Lys-144 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Imai et al.,  1997, J Clin Invest 100,2596-605</bibl>), the same cleavage site as found here with PAPP-A2. This immediately suggests PAPP
A2 as an obvious candidate IGFBP-5  proteinase for this tissue. </p><p>Cited references
