Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other elements are desirable and/or required in order to implement the present invention. However, because such elements are well known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, a discussion of such elements is not provided herein. The disclosure herein is directed to all such variations and modifications to such apparatus, systems and methods known to those skilled in the art. </p><p num="P-0018"> Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, by way of non-limiting example only, there is shown a roll <b>10</b> of tablet-like product <b>20</b> in a stacked configuration. Product <b>20</b> may be provided within an encasing substrate <b>30</b>, that may be formed of conventional packaging foil, for example. Roll <b>10</b> may be generally characterized as having a width (W) and radius (R). As is conventionally understood, where roll <b>30</b> substantially forms a cylinder, the surface area of substrate <b>30</b> may be approximately the circumferential surface area of the roll, or 2πRW, plus the ending surface areas, or 2πR<sup>2</sup>. Of course, the cross-section of roll <b>20</b> may form any suitable polygonal shape (e.g., square or rectangular), curvilinear shape (e.g., circular or oval) or composite polygonal and curvilinear cross-sectional configuration defining a desired perimetrical exterior wall surface to be labeled. </p><p num="P-0019"> According to an aspect of the present invention, there may be provided a label suitable for being secured about the outer perimetrical surface of a roll of product, and including at least one panel forming one or more pages that may be resealably accessed. The roll of product may, or may not, include an encasing substrate, such as packaging foil. </p><p num="P-0020"> In general, a resealable label according to an aspect of the present invention may be constructed and arranged such that opening or use of a panel does not render it impossible to reseal the label. A resealable label may generally be restored to substantially its initial appearance and condition after having been opened. </p><p num="P-0021"> Referring now also to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</figref> and <b>2</b>C, there are shown plan views of a labeling apparatus <b>100</b> according to an aspect of the present invention. Apparatus <b>100</b> includes first and second generally oppositely disposed surfaces <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>. Surface <b>120</b> may be suitable for being secured about roll <b>10</b> in an inwardly facing disposition. </p><p num="P-0022"> As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, apparatus <b>100</b> may generally have a width approximately equal to width W. Apparatus <b>100</b> may have a height generally corresponding to the perimetrical circumference (C) of roll <b>10</b>. Height H may be slightly greater than perimetrical circumference (C), such that when apparatus <b>10</b> is secured about roll <b>10</b>, a portion of apparatus <b>100</b> may overlap with another portion of apparatus <b>10</b>. For example, a portion <b>100</b>A of apparatus <b>100</b> may overlap with a portion <b>100</b>B of apparatus <b>100</b> when secured about roll <b>10</b> such that surface <b>120</b> of portion <b>100</b>A adheres to surface <b>110</b> of portion <b>10</b>B. Such adherence of surface <b>120</b> to surface <b>110</b> may serve to substantially secure apparatus <b>100</b> about roll <b>10</b>. Surface <b>120</b> of portion <b>100</b>A may include an adhesive <b>130</b>, such as a Pressure Sensitive Adhesive (PSA) by way of non-limiting example, for securing surface <b>120</b> to surface <b>110</b> in such a manner. Adhesive <b>130</b> may be partially deadened. </p><p num="P-0023"> Apparatus <b>100</b> may generally include first and second substantially planar members <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>. In operation, member <b>160</b> may be releasably adhered to member <b>150</b> such that member <b>160</b> may be at least partially peeled from member <b>150</b> to enable viewing of a greater portion of members <b>150</b> and/or <b>160</b> than may otherwise be possible, followed by readherence of member <b>160</b> to member <b>150</b>. Surface <b>110</b> of apparatus <b>100</b> may be formed of a combination of front surfaces of members <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> collectively. Members <b>150</b>, <b>160</b> may be such that labeling apparatus <b>10</b> may be partially destroyed in order to access a corresponding portion of product. In other words, apparatus <b>100</b> may be torn, and optionally have a portion thereof removed, to access and remove a corresponding portion of product <b>20</b> in a conventional manner. </p><p num="P-0024"> Referring now also to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, there are shown plan views of a first substantially planar member suitable for use as member <b>150</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. As may be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, member <b>150</b> may be of substantially width W and height H. Member <b>150</b> may generally include first and second generally oppositely disposed surfaces <b>155</b>, <b>120</b>. Surface <b>120</b> of member <b>150</b> may form surface <b>120</b> of apparatus <b>100</b>. Surface <b>155</b> of member <b>150</b> may partially form surface <b>110</b> of apparatus <b>100</b>. </p><p num="P-0025"> Member <b>150</b> may be largely formed of any suitable substrate. For example, member <b>150</b> may take the form of a flexible substrate such as a paper or plastic (such as, for example, polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene) sheet or other suitable web material. Member <b>150</b> may be clear or tinted, partially or entirely transparent, opaque or translucent, depending upon design criteria. Member <b>150</b> may, or may not, include perforations corresponding to positioning of apparatus <b>100</b> with respect to product <b>20</b>, for facilitating partial destruction of member <b>150</b> to access product <b>20</b>. </p><p num="P-0026"> Referring now also to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, there are shown plan views of a second substantially planar member suitable for use as member <b>160</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. As may be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, member <b>160</b> may generally have width W and include first and second generally oppositely disposed surfaces <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>. Member <b>160</b> may include portions <b>170</b>, <b>180</b>. Portion <b>180</b> may be removed prior to securing apparatus <b>100</b> about roll <b>10</b>, such that members <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> jointly form surface <b>110</b> (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). Accordingly, surface <b>162</b> of portion <b>170</b> may partially form surface <b>110</b> of apparatus <b>100</b>. </p><p num="P-0027"> Member <b>160</b> may be largely formed of any suitable substrate. For example, member <b>160</b> may take the form of a flexible substrate such as a paper or plastic (such as, for example, polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene) sheet or other suitable web material. Member <b>160</b> may be clear or tinted, partially or entirely transparent, opaque or translucent, depending upon design criteria. Member <b>160</b> may, or may not, include perforations corresponding to positioning of apparatus <b>100</b> with respect to product <b>20</b>, for facilitating partial destruction of member <b>160</b> to access product <b>20</b>. </p><p num="P-0028"> Surface <b>164</b> may have a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) <b>165</b> disposed on thereon and coupling the substrate to a release liner to better enable processing of the substrate until application of member <b>160</b> to member <b>150</b>. Such adhesive may be partially deadened in a region <b>190</b> largely corresponding to portion <b>170</b> (region <b>190</b> being designated by dashed lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Region <b>190</b> may be partially deadened by about 30% or 50%, for example. Such adhesive may be partially deadened in one or more regions <b>200</b>. Regions <b>200</b> are illustrated by way of non-limiting example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> to take the form of circles positioned substantially adjacent to a seam <b>210</b> between portions <b>170</b> and <b>180</b>. Regions <b>200</b> may be deadened approximately 5%, for example. Such adhesive may be substantially completely deadened everywhere else, except a region <b>220</b> positioned and configured for permanently securing member <b>160</b> to member <b>150</b>. Regions <b>190</b>, <b>200</b> and <b>220</b> may serve to increase the peel-ability and reseal-ability of members <b>150</b> and <b>160</b>. Although regions <b>190</b>, <b>200</b> and <b>220</b> are illustrated to take a particular form, the present invention is not so limited. </p><p num="P-0029"> Seam <b>210</b> may form an outermost edge of member <b>160</b> when apparatus <b>100</b> is secured about roll <b>10</b>. Seam <b>210</b> is illustrated in the non-limiting example of the Figures to be of a generally triangular shape having an apex near a distance W/2 from either end. Such a triangular shape may improve the peel-ability and reseal-ability of member <b>160</b> as compared to a tab for example, due in part to the tearable nature of either member <b>150</b> and/or member <b>160</b>. Of course, seam <b>210</b> may take any suitable configuration or shape though. </p><p num="P-0030"> According to an aspect of the present invention, member <b>150</b> may take the form of a 50 lbs. C/2/S substrate having a velocity gloss on surface <b>155</b> thereof. Member <b>150</b> may take the form of a 50 lbs. or 54 lbs. C/1/S substrate. Member <b>160</b> may take the form of 54 lbs. C/1/S substrate, that optionally may include a silicone adhesive. Member <b>160</b> may take the form of a 60 lbs. super gloss paper, that optionally may include a silicone adhesive. </p><p num="P-0031"> Labeling apparatus <b>100</b> may include printed indicia on members <b>150</b> and/or <b>160</b>, thereby providing greater billboard areas than may otherwise be available. For example, surface <b>155</b> of member <b>150</b> may be printed in a conventional manner (e.g. by flexographic, rotogravure, silk screening or other printing methods), thereby providing an amount of billboard commensurate with known techniques for labeling rolls <b>10</b> of product. Further, surface <b>162</b> of portion <b>170</b> may be analogously printed, thereby providing additional billboard. Further yet, surface <b>164</b> of portion <b>170</b> may be analogously printed providing yet a further degree of billboard. Printing on surface <b>155</b> of member <b>150</b> obscured by member <b>160</b>, as well as printing on surface <b>164</b> may be viewed upon peeling member <b>160</b> from member <b>150</b>. </p><p num="P-0032"> Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown a block diagrammatic representation of a method <b>500</b> suitable for manufacturing apparatus <b>100</b>. </p><p num="P-0033"> Member <b>150</b> may be printed <b>510</b> (e.g. by flexographic, rotogravure, silk screening or other printing methods) on surface <b>155</b>. In the event that member <b>150</b> includes an adhesive on surface <b>120</b>, such adhesive may optionally be deadened in select areas, such as areas other than areas corresponding to adhesive <b>130</b>. Otherwise, adhesive <b>130</b> may optionally be provided on surface <b>120</b>. </p><p num="P-0034"> Where member <b>160</b> is provided with an adhesive, such as a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA), on surface <b>164</b>, member <b>160</b> may be delaminated <b>520</b> from a backing layer, or release liner.
