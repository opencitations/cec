 TRANSFECTION AND/OR INJECTION OF NUCLEIC ACIDS  
The present invention is directed to (the use of) a solution containing at least one nucleic acid (sequence) and free mannose for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, particularly of RNA and mRNA. The inventive solution exhibits a positive effect on stabilization of the nucleic acid (sequence) during lyophilization and storage but also leads to a considerable increase of the transfection efficiency of a nucleic acid. It thus also increases in vivo expression of a protein encoded by such a nucleic acid upon increased transfection rate. The present invention is furthermore directed to a method of lyophilization using the mannose-containing solution, to pharmaceutical compositions, vaccines, kits, first and second medical indications applying such a mannose-containing solution and/or a nucleic acid (sequence) lyophilized or resuspended with such a solution"  
In gene therapy and many other therapeutically relevant biochemical and biotechnological applications the use of nucleic acids for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes is of major importance. As an example, rapid progress has occurred in recent years in the field of gene therapy and promising results have been achieved. Nucleic acids are therefore regarded as important tools for gene therapy and prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination against infectious and malignant diseases. Nucleic acids, both DNA and RNA, have been used widely in gene therapy, either in naked or in complexed form. In this context, the application of nucleic acids and particularly of RNA for therapeutic vaccination is revised permanently. On the one hand, nucleic acids and particularly RNA or mRNA molecules can be optimized for a more efficient transcription rate. The 5' Cap structure, the untranslated and translated regions are typically modified to stabilize the molecule or to change its characteristics to enhance its translation properties (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Pascolo, S. (2008), Handb Exp Pharmacol (183): 221 -35</bibl>). Further, different formulations of nucleic acids and particularly of mRNA molecules or different delivery routes are investigated to achieve improved expression levels. To mention are the encapsulation into cationic liposomes or cationic polymers (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hoerr, I., R. Obst, et a/. (2000), Eur J Immunol 30(1 ): 1 -7</bibl>. ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hess, P. R., D. Boczkowski, et al. (2006), Cancer Immunol Immunother 55(6): 672-83</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Scheel, B., R. Teufel, et al. (2005), Eur J Immunol 35(5): 1 557-66</bibl>), the needleless delivery of gold particles coated by mRNA using a gene gun (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Qiu, P., P. Ziegelhoffer, et al. (1 996). "Gene gun delivery of mRNA in situ results in efficient transgene expression and genetic immunization." Gene Ther 3(3): 262-8</bibl>), the transfection of in vitro generated autologous APCs that are re-administred to patients (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Boczkowski, D., S. K. Nair, et al. (1 996)</bibl>. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">"Dendritic cells pulsed with RNA are potent antigen-presenting cells in vitro and in vivo." J Exp Med 1 84(2): 465-72; Boczkowski, et al, 1 996, supra</bibl>), and the direct injection of naked RNA (see Hoerrr et al, 2000, supra). Despite all progress achieved regarding gene delivery it is very important to improve further transfection efficiency to make nucleic acids especially RNA applicable for all imaginable therapeutic purposes. Application of RNA thus represents a favored tool in modern molecular medicine. It also exhibits some superior properties over DNA cell transfection. As generally known, transfection of DNA molecules may lead to serious problems. E.g. application of DNA molecules bears the risk that the DNA integrates into the host genome. Integration of foreign DNA into the host genome can have an influence on expression of the host genes and possibly triggers expression of an oncogene or destruction of a tumor suppressor gene. Furthermore, a gene - and therefore the gene product - which is essential to the host may also be inactivated by integration of the foreign DNA into the coding region of this gene. There may be a particular danger if integration of the DNA takes place into a gene which is involved in regulation of cell growth. Nevertheless, DNA still represents an important tool, even though some risks are associated with the application of DNA. These risks do not occur if RNA, particularly mRNA, is used instead of DNA. An advantage of using RNA rather than DNA is that no virus-derived promoter element has to be administered in vivo and no integration into the genome may occur. Furthermore, the RNA has not to overcome the barrier to the nucleus. However, a main disadvantage resulting from the use of RNA is due to its huge instability. Even though it is understood that DNA, e.g., naked DNA, introduced into a patient' circulatory system is typically not stable and therefore may have little chance of affecting most disease processes (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Poxon et al, Pharmaceutical development and Technology, 5(1 ), 1 1 5-122 (2000)</bibl>) the problem of stability is even more evident in the case of RNA. As generally known, the physico chemical stability of RNAs in solution is extremely low. RNA is very susceptible to hydrolysis by ubiquitous ribonucleases and is typically completely degraded already after a few hours or days in solution. This even occurs in the absence of RNases, e.g. when stored a few hours or days in solution at room temperature.  
To avoid such degradation the RNA is typically stored at -20[deg.]C or even -80[deg.]C and RNAse free conditions to prevent a prior degradation of the RNA. This method, however, does not prevent a loss of function effectively and additionally is very cost-intensive for shipping when these temperatures have to be guaranteed. One further method for stabilization comprises lyophilization or freeze-drying of the RNA. Lyophilization is a worldwide known and recognized method in the art to enhance storage stability of temperature sensitive biomolecules, such as nucleic acids. During lyophilization, typically water is removed from a frozen sample containing nucleic acids via sublimation. The process of lyophilization is usually characterized by a primary and a secondary drying step. During the primary drying step, free, i.e. unbound, water surrounding the nucleic acid (sequence) and optionally further components, escapes from the solution. Subsequent thereto water being bound on a molecular basis by the nucleic acids may be removed in a secondary drying step by adding thermal energy. In both cases the hydration sphere around the nucleic acids is lost.  
During lyophilization the sample containing nucleic acids is initially cooled below the freezing point of the solution and accordingly of the water contained therein. As a result, the water freezes. Dependent on temperature, rate of cooling down (freezing rate), and the time for freezing, the crystal structure of water is changed. This exhibits physical stress on the nucleic acid (sequence) and other components of the solution, which may lead to a damage of the nucleic acid, e.g. breakage of strands, loss of supercoiling, etc. Furthermore, due to the decrease of volume and loss of the hydration sphere, autocatalytic degradation processes are favored e.g. by traces of transition metals. Additionally, significant changes of pH are possible by concentration of traces of acids and bases.  
Lyophilization involves two stresses, freezing and drying. Both are known to damage nucleic acids, such as non-viral vectors or plasmid DNA. In the literature, a number of cryoprotectants and lyoprotectants are discussed for lyophilization purposes to prevent these damages. In this context, cryoprotectants are understood as excipients, which allow influencing the structure of the ice and/or the eutectical temperature of the mixture. Lyoprotectants are typically excipients, which partially or totally replace the hydration sphere around a molecule and thus prevent catalytic and hydrolytic processes.  
In the specific context of DNA, lyophilization causes the removal of the hydration sphere around the DNA, wherein it appears that there are approximately 20 water molecules per nucleotide pair bound most tightly to DNA. These water molecules do not form an ice-like structure upon low-temperature cooling. Upon DNA dehydration over hygroscopic salts at 0% relative humidity, only five or six water molecules remain (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Tao et a!, Biopolymers, 28, 1019-1030 (1989)</bibl>). Lyophilization may increase the stability of DNA under long-term storage, but may also cause some damage upon the initial lyophilization process, potentially through changes in the DNA secondary structure, breaks of the nucleic acid chain(s) or the concentration of reactive elements such as contaminating metals. Lyophilization can also cause damage upon the initial lyophilization process in other nucleic acid, e.g. RNA. Agents that can substitute for non-freezable water, such as some carbohydrates, can demonstrate cryoprotective properties for DNA and other molecules during lyophilization of intact bacteria (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Israeli et al, Cryobiology, 30, 519-523 (1993)</bibl>; or <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Rudolph et al, Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 245, 134-143 (1986)</bibl>).  
During lyophilization, specific carbohydrates, such as several sugars, appear to play a central role in stabilization of the nucleic acid. However, when using cryoprotectants and lyoprotectants, no general rule may be applied with respect to their impact on different groups of compounds. Therefore, in many cases an optimal formulation has to be found using empirical methods.  
In this context, specific carbohydrates are utilized in the art as Iyoprotective substances for enhancing stability of the nucleic acid (sequence) during lyophilization. They exhibit an effect on storage stability after lyophilisation of pure nucleic acids or nucleic acid (sequence) complexes (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Maitani, Y., Y. Aso, et al. (2008), Int J Pharm 356(1 -2): 69- 75</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Quaak, S. C, J. H. van den Berg, et al. (2008), Eur J Pharm Biopharm 70(2): 429-38</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Jones, K. L., D. Drane, et al (2007), Biotechniques 43(5): 675-81</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Molina, M. C, S. D. Allison, et a! (2001 ), J Pharm Sci 90(10): 1445-55</bibl>; and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Allison, S. D. and T. J. Anchordoquy (2000), J Pharm Sci 89(5): 682-91</bibl> ). Lyoprotective properties are particularly described for sucrose, glucose, and trehalose. They allow to restore at least in part the transfection efficiency which is otherwise lost in many cases after lyophilisation (see Maitani et al, 2008, supra; Yadava, P., M. Gibbs, et al. (2008). <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">AAPS PharmSciTech 9(2): 335-41 ; Werth, S., B. Urban-Klein, et al. (2006), J Control Release 1 12(2): 257-70</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Brus, C, E. Kleemann, et al. (2004), J Control Release 95(1 ): 1 19-31</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Poxon, S. W. and j. A. Hughes (2000), Pharm Dev Technol 5(1 ): 1 15-22</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Anchordoquy, T. J., J. F. Carpenter, et al. (1997), Arch Biochem Biophys 348(1 ): 199-206</bibl>). Sugars are able to prevent loss in activity due to the lyophilization process mainly by preventing particle fusion/aggregation especially in the case of liposome complexed nucleic acids (see Yadava et al, 2008, supra; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Katas, H., S. Chen, etal. (2008), J Microencapsul: 1 -8</bibl>; Molina etal, supra, 2001 ).  
Particularly, Poxon et al. (2000, supra) investigated the effect of lyophilization on plasmid DNA activity. Poxon et al. (2000, supra) hypothetized, that a change in the DNA conformation from supercoiled to open circular and linear form would be indicative of damage of the plasmid DNA. However, the percentage of supercoiled DNA did not change after lyophilization and subsequent DMED treatment, suggesting that other effects drew responsible for the loss of transfection efficiency. Poxon et al. (2000, supra) found that a decrease in plasmid DNA activity as measured by an in vitro transfection assay can be ameliorated by the use of carbohydrates during lyophilization of the plasmid DNA but he did not found that any of the used carbohydrates increased the transfection efficiency of the plasmid DNA. As lyoprotectants, glucose (monosaccaride), sucrose and lactose (disaccharides) were used. Poxon et al. (2000, supra), however, only carried out investigations with plasmid DNA. They did also not investigate if the addition of saccharides to the lyophilization affects the stability of the lyophilized plasmid DNA.  
Li et al. (see <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Li, B., S. Li, et al. (2000), J Pharm Sci 89(3): 355-64</bibl>) furthermore showed that disaccharides are superior to monosaccharides using them as a cryoprotectant for lyophilization of lipid based gene delivery systems due to the prevention of aggregation. They noted that it is very important to prevent the particle size of the complexes during lyophilization. Unfortunately, in a specific example of lipid based gene delivery systems, lyophilization with mannose led to an increase in particle size, which was regarded as negative for transfection efficiency. Additionally Li et al. (2000, supra) showed that lipid delivery systems can be stored at room temperature without loss of transfection efficiency when lyophilized in 10% sucrose. Li et al. (2000, supra) did not examine the stabilization due to the presence of mannose as a lyoprotectant. More importantly, they did not observe an increase in the expression of the encoded protein due to the presence of sugar (sucrose and trehalose) in the injection buffer.  
Even though many available prior art documents discuss the stabilization of nucleic acids during lyophilization in the context of plasmid DNA, only few publications focus on stabilization of other nucleic acids, such as RNAs, e.g. during lyophilization and long-term storage.  
In this context, Jones et a/ (2007, supra) is one rare document, which examines the effect of sugars on long term stability of mRNA. It describes the possibility to prevent storage depending loss of transfection activity in vitro. Jones et al (2007 , supra) uses trehalose as a lyoprotectant and shows a preventive effect on the loss of transfection activity at a storage temperature of 4[deg.]C for a period of 6 months. Integrity of the mRNA was only measured by loss of weight after recovering. At elevated temperatures (room temperature and higher) degradation and a dramatic loss of transfection efficiency took place. Additionally; transfection efficiency could not be improved using trehalose as lyoprotectant.  
In a further context, specific carbohydrates may also be utilized to improve biological activity and/or transfection efficiency, which is, at least at a first glance, independent from stability issues. Such an effect of specific carbohydrates, e.g. of mannose may be attributed to the interaction of these carbohydrates with specific receptors in the cell. As an example, the addition of mannose may involve the mannose receptor targeted transfer. The mannose receptor (MR) is primarily present on dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. The carbohydrate recognition domains of the MR recognizes carbohydrates (e.g. mannose, fucose, glucose, N-Acetylglucosamine, maltose) on the cell walls of infectious agents (mainly bacteria and yeast) which leads to rapid internalization and phagocytosis. This process can initiate effective immune defense. Several different strategies targeted to the MR have been used to enhance transfection levels or to develop upgraded vaccines (see <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Keler, T., V. Ramakrishna, et al. (2004). "Mannose receptor-targeted vaccines." Expert Opin Biol Ther 4(12): 1 953-62</bibl>). In this context, mannose modified non-viral DNA vectors, including cationic liposomes (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kawakami, S., A. Sato, etal. (2000), Gene Ther 7(4): 292-9</bibl>; and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hattori, Y., S. Kawakami, et al. (2006), J Gene Med 8(7): 824-34</bibl>), polyethyleneimine (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Diebold, S. S., H. Lehrmann, etal. (1999), Hum Gene Ther 10(5): 775-86</bibl>), poly L-lysine (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nishikawa, M., S. Takemura, et al. (2000), J Drug Target 8(1 ): 29-38</bibl>), dendrimers (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Arima, H., Y. Chihara, et al. (2006), J Control Release 1 16(1 ): 64-74</bibl>) and chitosan (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kim, T. H., J. W. Nah, et al. (2006), J Nanosci Nanotechnol 6(9-10): 2796-803</bibl>); (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hashimoto, M., M. Morimoto, et al. (2006), Biotechnol Lett 28(1 1 ): 815-21</bibl> ), have been reported (see also review: <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Irache, J. M., H. H. Salman, et al. (2008). "Man nose-targeted systems for the delivery of therapeutics." Expert Opin Drug Deliv 5(6): 703-24</bibl>). However, in all cases mannose was covalently bound to the vector to ensure a combined uptake due to binding to the mannose receptor. However, the expression of the mannose receptor is restricted to a few cell types (especially dendritic cells) which are not excessively present in the dermis and therefore it appeared unlikely that free mannose improves the expression of the encoded protein due to an increased uptake in mannose receptor expressing cells.  
The only case which is known in the prior art to use free sugar to enhance transfection efficiency is disclosed in Sun et al (see <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sun, C, K. Ridderstrale, et al. (2007), Plant I 52(6): 1 192-8</bibl>). Sun et al. (2007) could show that sucrose can stimulate uptake of oligo deoxynucleotides (ODN) in human cells (in vitro). They investigated the effect of glucose and sucrose to the ODN delivery compared to the effect of oligofectamine, a commercially available lipid-based transfection reagent. Interestingly they observed that sucrose was 30% more potent than oligofectamine and even 60% more potent than glucose supporting ODN uptake. They hypothesized that sucrose is a common trigger for endocytosis in animal cells and therefore the ODN internalizes into endosomes together with the sucrose. Sun et al. (2007) only examined in vitro transfection assays which are very difficult to transfer to the in vivo situation due to the dilution effect. In tissues it thus appeared very unlikely that the nucleic acid and the sugar molecule enter the cell at the same time.  
Summarizing the above, there is a long-lasting and urgent need in the art to provide means, which allow (a skilled person) to store RNA without a loss in activity, an effect, which is oberved in many cases. Likewise, there is a long-lasting and urgent need to provide means, which allow (a skilled person) to enhance transfection efficiency of nucleic acids especially of RNA for in vitro and particularly for in vivo applications. In this context, a still most challenging problem of the prior art is the stability of the above defined nucleic acids, particularly during storage and delivery. Another challenging problem of the prior art, which in part due to the problem of stability, is the loss of activity subsequent to storage, or the loss of biological activity after lyophilization (e.g. increase in particle size, ...), which is observed for many nucleic acids. Final ly, a further challenging problem of the prior art represents the small amount of expressed protein or small biological activity of the nucleic acid obtained upon transfection into the cell. Some further problems can be regarded in the provision of a suitable final dosage form for delivering these nucleic acids but also the production, transport and storage thereof. Especially transport of RNA is a remaining problem because it is very cost-intensive to ensure temperatures at -20[deg.]C and below during shipment.  
All these mentioned challenging problems are solved by the present invention, particularly by the attached claims. According to a first aspect, the problem underlying the present invention is solved by (the use of) a solution containing at least one nucleic acid (sequence) and free mannose for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection. Preferably, the inventive solution containing at least one nucleic acid (sequence) and mannose stabilizes the at least one nucleic acid (sequence) contained in the inventive solution during lyophilization and/or improves biological activity of the nucleic acid (sequence). This is particularly preferable true, if a protein is encoded by the at least one nucleic acid (sequence), as expression of an encoded protein may be increased thereby. This solution is particularly surprising and was not suggested by any of the above mentioned prior art documents. In contrast, reviewing the prior art a skilled person would have rather suggested that - considering its teaching - addition of mannose as lyoprotectant diminishes transfection efficiency and even more problematic, may lead to a decrease of biological activity of the nucleic acid, or, if a protein is encoded, to a decrease of the expression of the encoded protein in vitro or in vivo. Regarding transfection the prior art only dealt with covalently bound mannose. Free mannose was never considered as suitable. As discussed above, in tissues it appears very unlikely that the nucleic acid and the sugar molecule enter the cell at the same time. Therefore, it was highly surprising for the present inventors to see that free mannose can in fact improve transfection efficiency in vivo as outlined herein.  
 In summary it was particularly surprising to the inventors, that use of such a mannose containing solution was associated with the significant increase of storage capabilities, particularly the storage at room temperature or higher could be shown using mannose as lyoprotectant. Additionally, it was particularly surprising, that an increase in transfection efficiency due to the use of such a mannose containing solution was associated with the significant increase in biological activity. In contrast to the covalent binding shown in the art the present inventors used free mannose which was only added to the solution and which was not covalently bound to the nucleic acid. As a combined uptake in mannose receptor expressing cells is unlikely due to the dilution effect in the tissue a skilled person would never have suggested that mannose could improve transfection efficiency of nucleic acids, especially RNA. Particularly Sun et a/, only examined in vitro transfection assays with free sugar containing solutions which are very difficult to transfer to the in vivo situation due to the dilution effect. Likewise, a skilled person would never have suggested that free mannose, could improve transfection efficiency of nucleic acids, especially RNA.  
According to the first aspect, the present invention thus provides (the use of) a solution containing at least one nucleic acid (sequence) and free mannose for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection. In this context "free" mannose is preferably understood as a mannose, which is not covalently bound to the nucleic acid (sequence).  
In the context of the present invention, mannose is preferably a sugar monomer of the aldohexose series of carbohydrates. Mannose as defined herein typically has the molecular formula C6H12C6, is also known under its lUPAC nomenclature as (2S,3S,4R,5R)- Pentahydroxyhexanal, (2A',3A&lt;,&gt;,4 ,55)-Pentahydroxyhexanal. It is preferably identified under CAS number 31 103-86-3 and typically exhibits the following general structure:  </p><p>&lt;EMI ID=10.1&gt;
 
Mannose is typically formed by the oxidation of mannitol. It can also be formed from D- glucose in the Lobry-de Bruyn-van Ekenstein transformation. Mannose as defined herein typically occurs in two diastereomeric isoforms, D-Mannose and L-Mannose (CAS numbers 3458-28-4 for D-mannose and 10030-80-5 for L-mannose). D-mannose is sold as a naturopathic remedy for urinary tract infections, and it is claimed to work through the disruption of adherence of bacteria in the urinary tract. D-Mannose and L-Mannose can be illustrated as the D and L straight-chain forms of mannose using Fischer projections according to the following structures:  </p><p>&lt;EMI ID=11.1&gt;
 
D-Mannose L-Mannose  
According to a particularly preferred embodiment, mannose as used herein is a D-Mannose. D-Mannose may be depicted according to at least one of the D-Mannose isomers a-D- Mannofuranose, [beta]-D-Mannofuranose, a-D-Mannopyranose and [beta]-D-Mannopyranose as represented by following Haworth-structures:  </p><p>&lt;EMI ID=11.2&gt;
 
 Typically, the occurrence of the different mannose isomers in nature significantly differs. D- Mannose forms anomers, wherein [alpha]-D-Mannofuranose ocurrs in a concentration/frequency of less than 1 %, [beta]-D-Mannofuranose in a concentration/frequency of less than 1 %, a-D- Mannopyranose in a concentration/frequency of about 67 % and [beta]-D-Mannopyranose in a concentration/frequency of about 33 %. Thus, D-Mannose may be selected more preferably from at least one, two, three or four of the anomers a-D-Mannofuranose, [beta]-D- Mannofuranose, a-D-Mannopyranose and/or [beta]-D-Mannopyranose. Most preferably, upon solubilization in an aqueous solution mannose typically forms the above anomers in an equilibrity reaction, typically in the above concentrations.  
According to a particularly preferred embodiment, mannose as used herein is selected from an anomeric mixture of D-Mannose, preferably an anomeric mixture comprising a-D- Mannofuranose, [beta]-D-Mannofuranose, a-D-Mannopyranose and [beta]-D-Mannopyranose, more preferably in the above concentrations/frequencies. Alternatively, but less preferred, mannose as used herein may be selected from L-mannose or a racemic mixture of D- Mannose and/or L-Mannose, wherein D-mannose preferably as described above. Such mixtures may be obtained e.g. by a non-selective synthesis of mannose, e.g. by nonselective oxidation of mannitol. An anomeric mixture may furthermore be obtained by solubilization of mannose in an aqueous solution, e.g. in water, WFI, or any buffer or solution as defined herein. According to a more particular embodiment, mannose as used herein is typically present in the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection in a concentration of about 0.01 to about 10% (w/w), preferably in a concentration of about 0.01 to about 10% (w/w), more preferably in a concentration of about 0.1 to about 7.5% (w/w), even more preferably in a concentration of about 0.5 to about 5% (w/w), and most preferably in a concentration of about 1 to about 4% (w/w), e.g. a concentration of about 2 to about 4% (w/w), such as about 2.5 % (w/w). Herein, a concentration of about 1 % (w/w) mannose corresponds to a concentration of about 55,506 mM mannose. Any of the above and herein mentioned values and concentrations for mannose in % (w/w) may thus be calculated in mM on the above basis.  
According to the above first embodiment, the present invention provides (use of) a solution containing at least one nucleic acid sequence and free mannose for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection of the at least one nucleic acid (sequence). In the context of the present invention, such a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may be any suitable nucleic acid, selected e.g. from any (double-stranded or single-stranded) DNA, preferably, without being limited thereto, e.g. genomic DNA, single-stranded DNA molecules, double-stranded DNA molecules, coding DNA, DNA primers, DNA probes, immunostimulatory DNA, a (short) DNA oligonucleotide ((short) oligodesoxyribonucleotides), or may be selected e.g. from any PNA (peptide nucleic acid) or may be selected e.g. from any (double-stranded or single-stranded) RNA, preferably, without being limited thereto, a (short) RNA oligonucleotide ((short) oligoribonucleotide), a coding RNA, a messenger RNA (mRNA), an immunostimulatory RNA, a siRNA, an antisense RNA, a micro RNA or riboswitches, ribozymes or aptamers; etc. The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may also be a ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a transfer RNA (tRNA), a messenger RNA (mRNA), or a viral RNA (vRNA). Preferably, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection is an RNA. More preferably, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be a (linear) single-stranded RNA, even more preferably an mRNA. In the context of the present invention, an mRNA is typically an RNA, which is composed of several structural elements, e.g. an optional 5'-UTR region, an upstream positioned ribosomal binding site followed by a coding region, an optional 3'- UTR region, which may be followed by a poly-A tail (and/or a poly-C-tail). An mRNA may occur as a mono-, di-, or even multicistronic RNA, i.e. an RNA which carries the coding sequences of one, two or more proteins or peptides. Such coding sequences in di-, or even multicistronic mRNA may be separated by at least one IRES sequence, e.g. as defined herein. Furthermore, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be a single- or a double-stranded nucleic acid (molecule) (which may also be regarded as a nucleic acid (molecule) due to non-covalent association of two single-stranded nucleic acid(s) (molecules)) or a partially double-stranded or partially single stranded nucleic acid, which are at least partially self complementary (both of these partially double-stranded or partially single stranded nucleic acid molecules are typically formed by a longer and a shorter single-stranded nucleic acid molecule or by two single stranded nucleic acid molecules, which are about equal in length, wherein one single- stranded nucleic acid molecule is in part complementary to the other single-stranded nucleic acid molecules molecule and both thus form a double-stranded nucleic acid molecules molecule in this region, i.e. a partially double-stranded or partially single stranded nucleic acid molecules). Preferably, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be a single-stranded nucleic acid molecule. Furthermore, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be a circular or linear nucleic acid molecule, preferably a linear nucleic acid molecule.  
According to one alternative, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be a coding nucleic acid, e.g. a DNA or RNA. Such a coding DNA or RNA may be any DNA or RNA as defined above. Preferably, such a coding DNA or RNA may be a single- or a double-stranded DNA or RNA, more preferably a single-stranded DNA or RNA, and/or a circular or linear DNA or RNA, more preferably a linear DNA or RNA. Even more preferably, the coding DNA or RNA may be a (linear) single-stranded DNA or RNA. Most preferably, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be a ((linear) single- stranded) messenger RNA (mRNA). Such an mRNA may occur as a mono-, di-, or even multicistronic RNA, i.e. an RNA which carries the coding sequences of one, two or more proteins or peptides. Such coding sequences in di-, or even multicistronic mRNA may be separated by at least one IRES sequence, e.g. as defined herein.  
The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may encode a protein or a peptide, which may be selected, without being restricted thereto, e.g. from therapeutically active proteins or peptides, from antigens, e.g. tumor antigens, pathogenic antigens (e.g. selected from pathogenic proteins as defined herein or from animal antigens, viral antigens, protozoal antigens, bacterial antigens, allergic antigens), autoimmune antigens, or further antigens, from allergens, from antibodies, from immunostimulatory proteins or peptides, from antigen-specific T-cell receptors, or from any other protein or peptide suitable for a specific (therapeutic) application, wherein the coding DNA or RNA may be transported into a cell, a tissue or an organism and the protein may be expressed subsequently in this cell, tissue or organism. a) Therapeutically active proteins In this context, therapeutically active proteins may be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection. These may be selected from any naturally occurring recombinant or isolated protein known to a skilled person from the prior art. Without being restricted thereto therapeutically active proteins may comprise proteins, capable of stimulating or inhibiting the signal transduction in the cell, e.g. cytokines, antibodies, etc. Therapeutically active proteins may thus comprise cytokines of class I of the family of cytokines, having 4 positionally conserved cysteine residues (CCCC) and comprising a conserved sequence motif Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser (WSXWS), wherein X is a non-conserved amino acid. Cytokines of class I of the family of cytokines comprise the GM-CSF subfamily, e.g. IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF, the IL-6-subfamily, e.g. IL-6, IL-1 1 , IL-12, or the IL-2- subfamily, e.g. IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, etc., or the cytokines IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-10 etc. Therapeutically active proteins may also comprise cytokines of class II of the family of cytokines, which also comprise 4 positionally conserved cystein residues (CCCC), but no conserved sequence motif Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser (WSXWS). Cytokines of class II of the family of cytokines comprise e.g. IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, etc. Therapeutically active proteins may additionally comprise cytokines of the family of tumor necrose factors, e.g. TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, etc., or cytokines of the family of chemokines, which comprise 7 transmembrane helices and interact with G-protein, e.g. IL-8, MIP-1 , RANTES, CCR5, CXR4, etc., or cytokine specific receptors, such as TNF-RI, TNF-RII, CD40, OX40 (CD134), Fas, etc.  
Therapeutically active proteins, which may be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may also be selected from any of the

 The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may alternatively encode an antigen. According to the present invention, the term "antigen" refers to a substance which is recognized by the immune system and is capable of triggering an antigen-specific immune response, e.g. by formation of antibodies as part of an adaptive immune response. In this context, the first step of an adaptive immune response is the activation of naive antigen-specific T cells by antigen-presenting cells. This occurs in the lymphoid tissues and organs through which naive T cells are constantly passing. The three cell types that can serve as antigen- presenting cells are dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Each of these cells has a distinct function in eliciting immune responses. Tissue dendritic cells take up antigens by phagocytosis and macropinocytosis and are stimulated by infection to migrate to the local lymphoid tissue, where they differentiate into mature dendritic cells. Macrophages ingest particulate antigens such as bacteria and are induced by infectious agents to express MHC class II molecules. The unique ability of B cells to bind and internalize soluble protein antigens via their receptors may be important to induce T cells. By presenting the antigen on MHC molecules leads to activation of T cells which induces their proliferation and differentiation into armed effector T cells. The most important function of effector T cells is the killing of infected cells by CD8&lt;+&gt; cytotoxic T cells and the activation of macrophages by TH1 cells which together make up cell-mediated immunity, and the activation of B cells by both TH2 and TH1 cells to produce different classes of antibody, thus driving the humoral immune response. T cells recognize an antigen by their T cell receptors which does not recognize and bind antigen directly, but instead recognize short peptide fragments e.g. of pathogens' protein antigens, which are bound to MHC molecules on the surfaces of other cells. T cells fall into two major classes that have different effector functions. The two classes are distinguished by the expression of the cell-surface proteins CD4 and CD8. These two types of T cells differ in the class of MHC molecule that they recognize. There are two classes of MHC molecule- MHC class I and MHC class II- which differ in their structure and expression pattern on tissues of the body. CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells bind to the MHC class II molecule and CD8&lt;+&gt; T cells to the MHC class I molecule. MHC class I and MHC class II have distinct distributions among cells that reflect the different effector functions of the T cells that recognize them. MHC class I molecules present peptides from pathogens, commonly viruses to CD8&lt;+&gt; T cells, which differentiate into cytotoxic T cells that are specialized to kill any cell that they specifically recognize. Almost all cells express MHC class I molecules, although the level of constitutive expression varies from one cell type to the next. But not only pathogenic peptides from viruses are presented by MHC class I molecules, also self-antigens like tumour antigens are presented by them. MHC class I molecules bind peptides from proteins degraded in the cytosol and transported in the endoplasmic reticulum. Thereby MHC class I molecules on the surface of cells infected with viruses or other cytosolic pathogens display peptides from these pathogen. The CD8&lt;+&gt; T cells that recognize MHC class hpeptide complexes are specialized to kill any cells displaying foreign peptides and so rid the body of cells infected with viruses and other cytosolic pathogens. The main function of CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells (CD4&lt;+&gt; helper T cells) that recognize MHC class II molecules is to activate other effector cells of the immune system. Thus MHC class II molecules are normally found on B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, cells that participate in immune responses, but not on other tissue cells. Macrophages, for example, are activated to kill the intravesicular pathogens they harbour, and B cells to secrete immunoglobulins against foreign molecules. MHC class II molecules are prevented from binding to peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum and thus MHC class II molecules bind peptides from proteins which are degraded in endosomes. They can capture peptides from pathogens that have entered the vesicular system of macrophages, or from antigens internalized by immature dendritic cells or the immunoglobulin receptors of B cells. Pathogens that accumulate in large numbers inside macrophage and dendritic cell vesicles tend to stimulate the differentiation of TH1 cells, whereas extracellular antigens tend to stimulate the production of TH2 cells. TH1 cells activate the microbicidal properties of macrophages and induce B cells to make IgG antibodies that are very effective of opsonising extracellular pathogens for ingestion by phagocytic cells, whereas TH2 cells initiate the humoral response by activating naive B cells to secrete IgM, and induce the production of weakly opsonising antibodes such as IgCl and lgG3 (mouse) and lgG2 and lgG4 (human) as well as IgA and IgE (mouse and human).  
In the context of the present invention, antigens as encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection typically comprise any antigen, falling under the above definition, more preferably protein and peptide antigens, e.g. tumor antigens, allergy antigens, auto-immune self- antigens, pathogens, etc. In accordance with the invention, antigens as encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be antigens generated outside the cell, more typically antigens not derived from the host organism (e.g. a human) itself (i.e. non-self antigens) but rather derived from host cells outside the host organism, e.g. viral antigens, bacterial antigens, fungal antigens, protozoological antigens, animal antigens (preferably selected from animals or organisms as disclosed herein), allergy antigens, etc. Allergy antigens are typically antigens, which cause an allergy in a human and may be derived from either a human or other sources. Antigens as encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be furthermore antigens generated inside the cell, the tissue or the body, e.g. by secretion of proteins, their degradation, metabolism, etc. Such antigens include antigens derived from the host organism (e.g. a human) itself, e.g. tumor antigens, self-antigens or auto-antigens, such as auto-immune self-antigens, etc., but also (non-self) antigens as defined above, which have been originally been derived from host cells outside the host organism, but which are fragmented or degraded inside the body, tissue or cell, e.g. by (protease) degradation, metabolism, etc.  
One class of antigens as encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection comprises tumor antigens. "Tumor antigens" are preferably located on the surface of the (tumor) cell. Tumor antigens may also be selected from proteins, which are overexpressed in tumor cells compared to a normal cell. Furthermore, tumor antigens also includes antigens expressed in cells which are (were) not themselves (or originally not themselves) degenerated but are associated with the supposed tumor. Antigens which are connected with tumor-supplying vessels or (re)formation thereof, in particular those antigens which are associated with neovascularization, e.g. growth factors, such as VEGF, bFGF etc., are also included herein. Antigens connected with a tumor furthermore include antigens from cells or tissues, typically embedding the tumor. Further, some substances (usually proteins or peptides) are expressed in patients suffering (knowingly or not-knowingly) from a cancer disease and they occur in increased concentrations in the body fluids of said patients. These substances are also referred to as "tumor antigens", however they are not antigens in the stringent meaning of an immune response inducing substance. The class of tumor antigens can be divided further into tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) and tumor-associated- antigens (TAAs). TSAs can only be presented by tumor cells and never by normal "healthy" cells. They typically result from a tumor specific mutation. TAAs, which are more common, are usually presented by both tumor and healthy cells. These antigens are recognized and the antigen-presenting cell can be destroyed by cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, tumor antigens can also occur on the surface of the tumor in the form of, e.g., a mutated receptor. In this case, they can be recognized by antibodies.  
Examples of tumor antigens as encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below. These tables illustrate specific (protein) antigens (i.e. "tumor antigens") with respect to the cancer disease, they are associated with. According to the invention, the terms "cancer diseases" and "tumor diseases" are used synonymously herein.

 More preferably, in the latter embodiment, the at least one antigen(s) according to b) is (are) selected from the following combination:  
 - Survivin and 5T4 In the above embodiments, each of the at least two (preferably different) antigens as defined herein may be encoded by one (monocistronic) RNA, preferably one (monocistronic) mRNA. In other words, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may comprise at least two (monocistronic) RNAs, preferably mRNAs, wherein each of these at least two (monocistronic) RNAs, preferably mRNAs, may encode just one (preferably different) antigen, preferably selected from one of the above mentioned combinations.  
According to another particularly preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may comprise (at least) one bi- or even multicistronic RNA, preferably mRNA, i.e. (at least) one RNA which carries two or even more of the coding sequences of at the least two (preferably different) antigens, preferably selected from one of the above mentioned combinations. Such coding sequences of the at least two (preferably different) antigens of the (at least) one bi- or even multicistronic RNA may be separated by at least one IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) sequence, as defined below. Thus, the term "encoding at least two (preferably different) antigens" may mean, without being limited thereto, that the (at least) one (bi- or even multicistronic) RNA, preferably a mRNA, may encode e.g. at least two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven or twelve (preferably different) antigens of the above mentioned group(s) of antigens or their fragments or variants. More preferably, without being limited thereto, the (at least) one (bi- or even multicistronic) RNA, preferably mRNA, may encode e.g. at least two, three, four, five or six (preferably different) antigens of the above mentioned subgroup(s) of antigens or their fragments or variants within the above definitions. In this context, a so-called IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) sequence as defined above can function as a sole ribosome binding site, but it can also serve to provide a bi- or even multicistronic RNA as defined above which codes for several proteins, which are to be translated by the ribosomes independently of one another. Examples of IRES sequences which can be used according to the invention are those from picornaviruses (e.g. FMDV), pestiviruses (CFFV), polioviruses (PV), encephalomyocarditis viruses (ECMV), foot and mouth disease viruses (FMDV), hepatitis C viruses (HCV), classical swine fever viruses (CSFV), mouse leukoma virus (MLV), simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) or cricket paralysis viruses (CrPV).  
According to a further particularly preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may comprise a mixture of at least one monocistronic RNA, preferably mRNA, as defined above, and at least one bi- or even multicistronic RNA, preferably mRNA, as defined above. The at least one monocistronic RNA and/or the at least one bi- or even multicistronic RNA preferably encode different antigens or their fragments or variants, the antigens preferably being selected from one of the above mentioned groups or subgroups of antigens, more preferably in one of the above mentioned combinations. However, the at least one monocistronic RNA and the at least one bi- or even multicistronic RNA may preferably also encode (in part) identical antigens selected from one of the above mentioned groups or subgroups of antigens, preferably in one of the above mentioned combinations, provided that the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as a whole provides at least two (preferably different) antigens as defined above. Such an embodiment may be advantageous e.g. for a staggered, e.g. time dependent, administration of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, e.g. as a pharmaceutical composition, as a vaccine, a lyophilized nucleic acid, etc., to a patient in need thereof. The components of a pharmaceutical composition, as a vaccine, a lyophilized nucleic acid, etc., particularly the different RNAs encoding the at least two (preferably different) antigens, may be e.g. contained in (different parts of) a kit of parts composition or may be e.g. administered separately as components of different pharmaceutical compositions, vaccines, lyophilized nucleic acids, etc. According to another embodiment, one further class of antigens as encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection comprises allergy antigens. Such allergy antigens may be selected from antigens derived from different sources, e.g. from animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, etc. Allergens in this context include e.g. grasses, pollens, molds, drugs, or numerous environmental triggers, etc. Allergy antigens typically belong to different classes of compounds, such as nucleic acids and their fragments, proteins or peptides and their fragments, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, sugars, lipids, phospholipids, etc. Of particular interest in the context of the present invention are antigens, which may be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, i.e. protein or peptide antigens and their fragments or epitopes, or nucleic acids and their fragments, particularly nucleic acids and their fragments, encoding such protein or peptide antigens and their fragments or epitopes.  
Particularly preferred, antigens derived from animals, which may be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may include antigens derived from, without being limited thereto, insects, such as mite (e.g. house dust mites), mosquito, bee (e.g. honey bee, bumble bee), cockroache, tick, moth (e.g. silk moth), midge, bug, flea, wasp, caterpillar, fruit fly, migratory locust, grasshopper, ant aphide, from crustaceans, such as shrimps, crab, krill, lobster, prawn, crawfish, scampi, from birds, such as duck, goose, seagull, turkey, ostrich, chicken, from fishes, such as eel, herring, carp, seabream, codfish, halibut, catfish, beluga, salmon, flounder, mackerel, cuttlefish, perch, form molluscs, such as scallop, octopus, abalone, snail, whelk, squid, clam, mussel, from spiders, from mammals, such as cow, rabbit, sheep, lion, jaguar, leopard, rat, pig, buffalo, dog, loris, hamster, guinea pig, fallow deer, horse, cat, mouse, ocelot, serval, from arthropod, such as spider, or silverfish, from worms, such as nematodes, from trichinella species, or roundworm, from amphibians, such as frogs, or from sea squirt, etc.  
Antigens derived from plants, which may be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may include antigens derived from, without being limited thereto, fruits, such as kiwi, pineapple, jackfruit,papaya, lemon, orange, mandarin, melon, sharon fruit, strawberry, lychee, apple, cherry paradise apple, mango, passion fruit, plum, apricot, nectarine, pear, passion fruit, raspberry, grape, from vegetables, such as garlic, onion, leek, soya bean, celery, cauliflower, turnip, paprika, chickpea, fennel, zucchini, cucumber, carrot, yam, bean, pea, olive, tomato, potato, lentil, lettuce, avocado, parsley, horseradish, chirimoya, beet, pumkin, spinach, from spices, such as mustard, coriander, saffron, pepper, aniseed, from crop, such as oat, buckwheat, barley, rice, wheat, maize, rapeseed, sesame, from nuts, such as cashew, walnut, butternut, pistachio, almond, hazelnut, peanut, brazil nut, pecan, chestnut, from trees, such as alder, hornbeam, cedar, birch, hazel, beech, ash, privet, oak, plane tree, cypress, palm, from flowers, such as ragweed, carnation, forsythia, sunflower, lupine, chamomile, lilac, passion flower, from grasses, such as quack grass, common bent, brome grass, Bermuda grass, sweet vernal grass, rye grass, or from other plants, such as opium poppy, pellitory, ribwort, tobacco, asparagus, mugwort, cress, etc. Antigens derived from fungi, which may be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may include antigens derived from, without being limited thereto, e.g. Alternia sp., Aspergillus sp., Beauveria sp., Candida sp., Cladosporium sp., Endothia sp., Curcularia sp., Embellisia sp., Epicoccum sp., Fusarium sp., Malassezia sp., Penicillum sp., Pleospora sp., Saccharomyces sp., etc.  
Antigens derived from bacteria, which may be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may include antigens derived from, without being limited thereto, e.g. Bacillus tetani, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces griseus, etc. Antibodies  
 According to a further alternative, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may encode an antibody. According to the present invention, such an antibody may be selected from any antibody, e.g. any recombinantly produced or naturally occurring antibodies, known in the art, in particular antibodies suitable for therapeutic, diagnostic or scientific purposes, or antibodies which have been identified in relation to specific cancer diseases. Herein, the term "antibody" is used in its broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (including agonist, antagonist, and blocking or neutralizing antibodies) and antibody species with polyepitopic specificity. According to the invention, "antibody" typically comprises any antibody known in the art (e.g. IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE antibodies), such as naturally occurring antibodies, antibodies generated by immunization in a host organism, antibodies which were isolated and identified from naturally occurring antibodies or antibodies generated by immunization in a host organism and recombinantly produced by biomolecular methods known in the art, as well as chimeric antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, bispecific antibodies, intrabodies, i.e. antibodies expressed in cells and optionally localized in specific cell compartments, and fragments and variants of the aforementioned antibodies. In general, an antibody consists of a light chain and a heavy chain both having variable and constant domains. The light chain consists of an N-terminal variable domain, VL, and a C-terminal constant domain, Q. In contrast, the heavy chain of the IgG antibody, for example, is comprised of an N-terminal variable domain, VH, and three constant domains, CH1 , CH2 und CH3. Single chain antibodies may be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid according to the present invention as well.  
According to a first alternative, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may encode a polyclonal antibody. In this context, the term, "polyclonal antibody" typically means mixtures of antibodies directed to specific antigens or immunogens or epitopes of a protein which were generated by immunization of a host organism, such as a mammal, e.g. including goat, cattle, swine, dog, cat, donkey, monkey, ape, a rodent such as a mouse, hamster and rabbit. Polyclonal antibodies are generally not identical, and thus usually recognize different epitopes or regions from the same antigen. Thus, in such a case, typically a mixture (a composition) of different at least one nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection will be used, each lyophilized nucleic acid encoding a specific (monoclonal) antibody being directed to specific antigens or immunogens or epitopes of a protein.  
According to a further alternative, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may encode a monoclonal antibody. The term "monoclonal antibody" herein typically refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally-occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed to a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed to different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed to a single determinant on the antigen. For example, monoclonal antibodies as defined above may be made by the hybridoma method first described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975)</bibl>, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods, e.g. as described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 4,81 6,567</bibl>. "Monoclonal antibodies" may also be isolated from phage libraries generated using the techniques described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">McCafferty et a/., Nature, 348:552-554 (1990)</bibl>, for example. According to Kohler and Milstein, an immunogen (antigen) of interest is injected into a host such as a mouse and B-cell lymphocytes produced in response to the immunogen are harvested after a period of time. The B-cells are combined with myeloma cells obtained from mouse and introduced into a medium which permits the B-cells to fuse with the myeloma cells, producing hybridomas. These fused cells (hybridomas) are then placed into separate wells of microtiter plates and grown to produce monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies are tested to determine which of them are suitable for detecting the antigen of interest. After being selected, the monoclonal antibodies can be grown in cell cultures or by injecting the hybridomas into mice. However, for the purposes of the present invention, the peptide sequences of these monoclonal antibodies have to be sequenced and the at least one nucleic acid (sequence) encoding these antibodies can be present as the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection.  
For therapeutical purposes in humans, non-human monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, such as murine antibodies may also be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection. However, such antibodies are typically only of limited use, since they generally induce an immune response by production of human antibodies directed to the said non-human antibodies, in the human body. Therefore, a particular non-human antibody can only be administered once to the human. To solve this problem, chimeric, humanized non-human and human antibodies are also envisaged encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection. "Chimeric" antibodies, which may be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection are preferably antibodies in which the constant domains of an antibody described above are replaced by sequences of antibodies from other organisms, preferably human sequences. "Humanized" (non- human) antibodies, which may be also encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection are antibodies in which the constant and variable domains (except for the hypervariable domains) described above of an antibody are replaced by human sequences. According to another alternative, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may encode human antibodies, i.e. antibodies having only human sequences. Such human antibodies can be isolated from human tissues or from immunized non-human host organisms which are transgene for the human IgG gene locus, and at least one nucleic acid (sequence) may be prepared according to procedures well known in the art. Additionally, human antibodies can be provided by the use of a phage display.  
In addition, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may encode bispecific antibodies. "Bispecific" antibodies in context of the invention are preferably antibodies which act as an adaptor between an effector and a respective target by two different F^-domains, e.g. for the purposes of recruiting effector molecules such as toxins, drugs, cytokines etc., targeting effector cells such as CTL, NK cells, makrophages, granulocytes, etc. (see for review: <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kontermann R.E., Acta Pharmacol. Sin, 2005, 26(1 ): 1 -9</bibl>). Bispecific antibodies as described herein are, in general, configured to recognize by two different F^-domains, e.g. two different antigens, immunogens, epitopes, drugs, cells (or receptors on cells), or other molecules (or structures) as described above. Bispecificity means herewith that the antigen-binding regions of the antibodies are specific for two different epitopes. Thus, different antigens, immunogens or epitopes, etc. can be brought close together, what, optionally, allows a direct interaction of the two components. For example, different cells such as effector cells and target cells can be connected via a bispecific antibody. Encompassed, but not limited, by the present invention are antibodies or fragments thereof which bind, on the one hand, a soluble antigen as described herein, and, on the other hand, an antigen or receptor on the surface of a tumor cell.  
According to the invention, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may also encode intrabodies, wherein these intrabodies may be antibodies as defined above. Since these antibodies are intracellular expressed antibodies, i.e. antibodies which may be encoded by nucleic acids localized in specific areas of the cell and also expressed there, such antibodies may be termed intrabodies.  
Antibodies as encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may preferably comprise full-length antibodies, i.e. antibodies composed of the full heavy and full light chains, as described above. However, derivatives of antibodies such as antibody fragments, variants or adducts may also be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection.  
The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may also encode antibody fragments selected from Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fc, Facb, pFc', Fd and Fv fragments of the aforementioned (full-length) antibodies. In general, antibody fragments are known in the art. For example, a Fab ("fragment, antigen binding") fragment is composed of one constant and one variable domain of each of the heavy and the light chain. The two variable domains bind the epitope on specific antigens. The two chains are connected via a disulfide linkage. A scFv ("single chain variable fragment") fragment, for example, typically consists of the variable domains of the light and heavy chains. The domains are linked by an artificial linkage, in general a polypeptide linkage such as a peptide composed of 1 5-25 glycine, proline and/or serine residues. According to a further alternative, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be in the form of dsRNA, preferably siRNA. A dsRNA, or a siRNA, is of interest particularly in connection with the phenomenon of RNA interference. The in vitro technique of RNA interference (RNAi) is based on double-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNA), which trigger the sequence-specific suppression of gene expression (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Zamore (2001 ) Nat. Struct. Biol. 9: 746-750</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sharp (2001 ) Genes Dev. 5:485- 490</bibl>: <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hannon (2002) Nature 41 : 244-251</bibl> ). In the transfection of mammalian cells with long dsRNA, the activation of protein kinase R and RnaseL brings about unspecific effects, such as, for example, an interferon response (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Stark et al. (1998) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 67: 227- 264</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">He and Katze (2002) Viral Immunol. 15: 95-1 19</bibl>). These unspecific effects are avoided when shorter, for example 21 - to 23-mer, so-called siRNA (small interfering RNA), is used, because unspecific effects are not triggered by siRNA that is shorter than 30 bp (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Elbashir et al. (2001 ) Nature 41 1 : 494-498</bibl>).  
The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may thus be a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) having a length of from 1 7 to 29, preferably from 19 to 25, and preferably being at least 90%, more preferably 95% and especially 00% (of the nucleotides of a dsRNA) complementary to a section of the nucleic acid (sequence) of a (therapeutically relevant) protein or antigen described (as active ingredient) hereinbefore, either a coding or a non-coding section, preferably a coding section. 90% complementary means that with a length of a dsRNA described herein of, for example, 20 nucleotides, this contains not more than 2 nucleotides without corresponding complementarity with the corresponding section of the mRNA. The sequence of the double- stranded RNA used according to the invention is, however, preferably wholly complementary in its general structure with a section of the nucleic acid of a therapeutically relevant protein or antigen described hereinbefore. In this context the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be a dsRNA having the general structure 5'-(N17.29)-3', preferably having the general structure 5'-(N19_2s)-3', more preferably having the general structure 5'-(N19.24)-3', or yet more preferably having the general structure 5'-([Nu]2[iota]_23)-3', wherein for each general structure each N is a (preferably different) nucleotide of a section of the mRNA of a therapeutically relevant protein or antigen described hereinbefore, preferably being selected from a continuous number of 1 7 to 29 nucleotides of the mRNA of a therapeutically relevant protein or antigen and being present in the general structure 5'-(N17_29)-3 ' in their natural order. In principle, all the sections having a length of from 1 7 to 29, preferably from 19 to 25, base pairs that occur in the mRNA can serve as target sequence for a dsRNA herein. Equally, dsRNAs used as nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection can also be directed against nucleotide sequences of a (therapeutically relevant) protein or antigen described (as active ingredient) hereinbefore that do not lie in the coding region, in particular in the 5' non-coding region of the mRNA, for example, therefore, against non-coding regions of the mRNA having a regulatory function. The target sequence of the dsRNA used as nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection can therefore lie in the translated and untranslated region of the mRNA and/or in the region of the control elements of a protein or antigen described hereinbefore. The target sequence of a dsRNA used as the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection can also lie in the overlapping region of untranslated and translated sequence; in particular, the target sequence can comprise at least one nucleotide upstream of the start triplet of the coding region of the mRNA.  
According to another alternative, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be in the form of a CpG nucleic acid, in particular CpG-RNA or CpG-DNA. A CpG-RNA or CpG-DNA used according to the invention can be a single-stranded CpG-DNA (ss CpG-DNA), a double-stranded CpG-DNA (dsDNA), a single-stranded CpG-RNA (ss CpG-RNA) or a double-stranded CpG-RNA (ds CpG-RNA). The CpG nucleic acid used according to the invention is preferably in the form of CpG-RNA, more preferably in the form of single-stranded CpG-RNA (ss CpG-RNA). Also preferably, such CpG nucleic acids have a length as described above. Preferably the CpG motifs are unmethylated.  
Likewise, according to a further alternative, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be in the form of an immunostimulatory RNA. Such an immunostimulatory RNA used as the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be any (double-stranded or single-stranded) RNA, e.g. a coding RNA, as defined above. Preferably, the immunostimulatory RNA may be a single-stranded, a double-stranded or a partially double-stranded RNA, more preferably a single-stranded RNA, and/or a circular or linear RNA, more preferably a linear RNA. More preferably, the immunostimulatory RNA may be a (linear) single-stranded RNA. Even more preferably, the immunostimulatory RNA may be a ((linear) single-stranded) messenger RNA (mRNA). An immunostimulatory RNA may also occur as a short RNA oligonucleotide as defined above. An immunostimulatory RNA as used herein may furthermore be selected from any class of RNA molecules, found in nature or being prepared synthetically, and which can induce an immune response. In this context, an immune response may occur in various ways. A substantial factor for a suitable immune response is the stimulation of different T-cell sub-populations. T- lymphocytes are typically divided into two sub-populations, the T-helper 1 (Th1 ) cells and the T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, with which the immune system is capable of destroying intracellular (Th1 ) and extracellular (Th2) pathogens (e.g. antigens). The two Th cell populations differ in the pattern of the effector proteins (cytokines) produced by them. Thus, Th1 cells assist the cellular immune response by activation of macrophages and cytotoxic T- cells. Th2 cells, on the other hand, promote the humoral immune response by stimulation of the B-cells for conversion into plasma cells and by formation of antibodies (e.g. against antigens). The Th1/Th2 ratio is therefore of great importance in the immune response. In connection with the present invention, the Th1 Th2 ratio of the immune response is preferably shifted in the direction towards the cellular response (Th1 response) and a cellular immune response is thereby induced. According to one example, the immune system may be activated by ligands of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are a family of highly conserved pattern recognition receptor (PRR) polypeptides that recognize pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and play a critical role in innate immunity in mammals. Currently at least thirteen family members, designated TLR1 - TLR13 (Toll-like receptors: TLR1 , TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR1 1 , TLR12 or TLR13), have been identified. Furthermore, a number of specific TLR ligands have been identified. It was e.g. found that unmethylated bacterial DNA and synthetic analogs thereof (CpG DNA) are ligands for TLR9 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hemmi H et a/. (2000) Nature 408:740-5</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bauer S et a/. (2001 ) Proc NatlAcadSci USA 98, 9237-42</bibl>). Furthermore, it has been reported that ligands for certain TLRs include certain nucleic acid molecules and that certain types of RNA are immunostimulatory in a sequence-independent or sequence-dependent manner, wherein these various immunostimulatory RNAs may e.g. stimulate TLR3, TLR7, or TLR8, or intracellular receptors such as RIG-I, MDA-5, etc. E.g. Lipford et a/, determined certain G,U- containing oligoribonucleotides as immunostimulatory by acting via TLR7 and TLR8 (see <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 03/086280</bibl>). The immunostimulatory G,U-containing oligoribonucleotides described by Lipford et a/, were believed to be derivable from RNA sources including ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, messenger RNA, and viral RNA. According to the present invention, it was found that any RNA (molecule) as e.g. defined above (irrespective of its specific length, strandedness, modification and/or nucleotide sequence) may have immunostimulatory properties, i.e. enhance the immune response. An RNA as defined above and being the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may thus be used to enhance (unspecific) immunostimulation, if suitable and desired for a specific treatment.  
The at least one (immunostimulatory) RNA (molecule) used as the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may thus comprise any RNA sequence known to be immunostimulatory, including, without being limited thereto, RNA sequences representing and/or encoding ligands of TLRs, preferably selected from family members TLR1 - TLR13, more preferably from TLR7 and TLR8, ligands for intracellular receptors for RNA (such as RIG-I or MAD-5, etc.) (see e.g. Meylan, E., Tschopp, J. (2006). Toll-like receptors and RNA helicases: two parallel ways to trigger antiviral responses. Mol. Cell 22, 561 -569), or any other immunostimulatory RNA sequence. Furthermore, (classes of) immunostimulatory RNA molecules, used as the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may include any other RNA capable of eliciting an immune response. Without being limited thereto, such an immunostimulatory RNA may include ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and viral RNA (vRNA).  
Such further (classes of) immunostimulatory RNA molecules, which may be used as the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, without being limited thereto, may comprise e.g. an RNA molecule of formula (I):  
G¦XmGn wherein:  
G is guanosine, uracil or an analogue of guanosine or uracil;  
 X is guanosine, uracil, adenosine, thymidine, cytosine or an analogue of the above- mentioned nucleotides;  
I is an integer from 1 to 40, wherein when I = 1 G is guanosine or an analogue thereof,  
 when I &gt; 1 at least 50% of the nucleotides are guanosine or an analogue thereof;

 wherein when m = 3 X is uracil or an analogue thereof,  
 when m &gt; 3 at least 3 successive uracils or analogues of uracil occur;  
n is an integer from 1 to 40,  
 wherein when n = 1 G is guanosine or an analogue thereof,  
 when n &gt; 1 at least 50% of the nucleotides are guanosine or an analogue thereof.  
In addition, such further (classes of) immunostimulatory RNA molecules, which may be used as the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may comprise, without being limited thereto, e.g. an RNA molecule of formula (II):  
C¦XmCn wherein:  
C is cytosine, uracil or an analogue of cytosine or uracil;  
 X is guanosine, uracil, adenosine, thymidine, cytosine or an analogue of the above- mentioned nucleotides;  
I is an integer from 1 to 40,  
 wherein when I = 1 C is cytosine or an analogue thereof,  
 when I &gt; 1 at least 50% of the nucleotides are cytosine or an analogue thereof;  
m is an integer and is at least 3;  
 wherein when m = 3 X is uracil or an analogue thereof,  
 when m &gt; 3 at least 3 successive uracils or analogues of uracil occur;  
n is an integer from 1 to 40,  
 wherein when n = 1 C is cytosine or an analogue thereof,  
 when n &gt; 1 at least 50% of the nucleotides are cytosine or an analogue thereof. Preferably, the immunostimulatory RNA molecules used as the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may comprise a length as defined above in general for RNA molecules of the RNA of the present invention, more preferably a length of 5 to 5000, of 500 to 5000 or, more preferably, of 1000 to 5000 or, alternatively, of 5 to 1000, 5 to 500, 5 to 250, of 5 to 100, of 5 to 50 or, more preferably, of 5 to 30 nucleotides.  
The immunostimulatory RNA used as the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be furthermore modified, preferably "chemically modified" in order to enhance the immunostimulatory properties of said RNA. The term "chemical modification" means that the immuostimulatory RNA is modified by replacement, insertion or removal of individual or several atoms or atomic groups compared with naturally occurring RNA species.  
Preferably, the chemical modification of the immunostimulatory RNA comprises at least one analogue of naturally occurring nucleotides. In a list which is in no way conclusive, examples which may be mentioned for nucleotide analogues and which may be used herein for modification are analogues of guanosine, uracil, adenosine, thymidine, cytosine.

The preparation of such analogues is known to a person skilled in the art, for example from <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US Patents 4,373,071</bibl> , <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,401 ,796</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,41 5,732</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,458,066</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,500,707</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,668,777</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,973,679</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 5,047,524</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 5,132,41 8</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 5,153,319</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 5,262,530 and 5,700,642</bibl>. In the case of an analogue as described above, particular preference is given according to the invention to those analogues that increase the immunogenicity of the immunostimulatory RNA sequence used as the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection and/or do not interfere with a further modification that has been introduced into said immunostimulatory RNA.  
In general, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above may also occur in the form of a modified nucleic acid, wherein any modification, as defined herein, may be introduced into the nucleic acid prior to lyophilization, transfection and/or injection. Modifications as defined herein preferably lead to a further stabilized nucleic acid as defined herein.  
According to a first embodiment, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may thus be provided as a "stabilized nucleic acid", preferably as a stabilized RNA, more preferably as an RNA that is essentially resistant to in vivo degradation (e.g. by an exo- or endo-nuclease). Such stabilization can be effected, for example, by a modified phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection. A backbone modification in connection with the present invention is a modification in which phosphates of the backbone of the nucleotides contained in the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection are chemically modified. Nucleotides that may be preferably used in this connection contain e.g. a phosphorothioate- modified phosphate backbone, preferably at least one of the phosphate oxygens contained in the phosphate backbone being replaced by a sulfur atom. Stabilized at least one nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may further include, for example: non-ionic phosphate analogues, such as, for example, alkyl and aryl phosphonates, in which the charged phosphonate oxygen is replaced by an alkyl or aryl group, or phosphodiesters and alkylphosphotriesters, in which the charged oxygen residue is present in alkylated form. Such backbone modifications typically include, without implying any limitation, modifications from the group consisting of methylphosphonates, phosphoramidates and phosphorothioates (e.g. cytidine-5'-0-(1 - thiophosphate)). The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may additionally or alternatively also contain sugar modifications. A sugar modification in connection with the present invention is a chemical modification of the sugar of the nucleotides of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection typically includes, without implying any limitation, sugar modifications selected from the group consisting of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro- oligoribonucleotide (2 '-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine-5 '-triphosphate, 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine- 5'-triphosphate), 2'-deoxy-2'-deamine oligoribonucleotide (2'-amino-2'-deoxycytidine-5'- triphosphate, 2'-amino-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate), 2'-0-alkyl oligoribonucleotide, 2'- deoxy-2'-C-alkyl oligoribonucleotide (2'-0-methylcytidine-5'-triphosphate, 2'- methyluridine-5'-triphosphate), 2'-C-alkyl oligoribonucleotide, and isomers thereof (2&lt;1&gt;- aracytidine-5'-triphosphate, 2'-arauridine-5'-triphosphate), or azidotriphosphate (2'-azido- 2 '-deoxycytidine-5 '-triphosphate, 2 '-azido-2'-deoxyuridine-5 '-triphosphate). The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may additionally or alternatively also contain at least one base modification, which is preferably suitable for increasing the expression of the protein coded for by the lyophilized nucleic acid as compared with the unaltered, i.e. natural (= native), nucleic acid (sequence). Significant in this case means an increase in the expression of the protein compared with the expression of the native nucleic acid (sequence) by at least 20%, preferably at least 30%, 40%, 50% or 60%, more preferably by at least 70%, 80%, 90% or even 100% and most preferably by at least 150%, 200% or even 300% or more. In connection with the present invention, a nucleotide having such a base modification is preferably selected from the group of the base-modified nucleotides consisting of 2-amino- 6-chloropurineriboside-5'-triphosphate, 2-aminoadenosine-5'-triphosphate, 2-thiocytidine- 5'-triphosphate, 2-thiouridine-5'-triphosphate, 4-thiouridine-5'-triphosphate, 5- aminoallylcytidine-5'-triphosphate, 5-aminoallyluridine-5'-triphosphate, 5-bromocytidine- 5 '-triphosphate, 5-bromouridine-5'-triphosphate, 5-iodocytidine-5'-triphosphate, 5- iodouridine-5'-triphosphate, 5-methylcytidine-5'-triphosphate, 5-methyluridine-5'- triphosphate, 6-azacytidine-5 '-triphosphate, 6-azauridine-5'-triphosphate, 6- chloropurineriboside-5'-triphosphate, 7-deazaadenosine-5 '-triphosphate, 7- deazaguanosine-5 '-triphosphate, 8-azaadenosine-5 '-triphosphate, 8-azidoadenosine-5'- triphosphate, benzimidazole-riboside-5'-triphosphate, N1 -methyladenosine-5'-triphosphate, N1 -methylguanosine-5'-triphosphate, N6-methyladenosine-5'-triphosphate, 06- methylguanosine-5 '-triphosphate, pseudouridine-5 '-triphosphate, or puromycin-5'- triphosphate, xanthosine-5'-triphosphate. Particular preference is given to nucleotides for base modifications selected from the group of base-modified nucleotides consisting of 5- methylcytidine-5'-triphosphate, 7-deazaguanosine-5'-triphosphate, 5-bromocytidine-5'- triphosphate, and pseudouridine-5'-triphosphate.  
According to another embodiment, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection can likewise be modified (and preferably stabilized) by introducing further modified nucleotides containing modifications of their ribose or base moieties. Generally, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may contain any native (= naturally occurring) nucleotide, e.g. guanosine, uracil, adenosine, and/or cytosine or an analogue thereof. In this connection, nucleotide analogues are defined as non-natively occurring variants of naturally occurring nucleotides. Accordingly, analogues are chemically derivatized nucleotides with non-natively occurring functional groups, which are preferably added to or deleted from the naturally occurring nucleotide or which substitute the naturally occurring functional groups of a nucleotide. Accordingly, each component of the naturally occurring nucleotide may be modified, namely the base component, the sugar (ribose) component and/or the phosphate component forming the backbone (see above) of the nucleic acid sequence. Exemplary analogues of guanosine, uracil, adenosine, and cytosine include, without implying any limitation, any naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring guanosine, uracil, adenosine, thymidine or cytosine that has been altered chemically, for example by acetylation, methylation, hydroxylation, etc., including 1 -methyl-adenosine, 1 -methyl-guanosine, 1 - methyl-inosine, 2,2-dimethyl-guanosine, 2,6-diaminopurine, 2'-Amino-2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'- Amino-2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-Amino-2'-deoxyguanosine, 2'-Amino-2'-deoxyuridine, 2-Amino-6- chloropurineriboside, 2-Aminopurine-riboside, 2'-Araadenosine, 2'-Aracytidine, 2'-Arauridine, 2'-Azido-2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'-Azido-2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-Azido-2'-deoxyguanosine, 2'- Azido-2'-deoxyuridine, 2-Chloroadenosine, 2'-Fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'-Fluoro-2'- deoxycytidine, 2'-Fluoro-2'-deoxyguanosine, 2'-Fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, 2'-Fluorothymidine, 2-methyl-adenosine, 2-methyl-guanosine, 2-methyl-thio-N6-isopenenyl-adenosine, 2'-0- Methyl-2-aminoadenosine, 2'-0-Methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'-0-Methyl-2'-deoxycytidine, 2'- 0-Methyl-2'-deoxyguanosine, 2'-0-Methyl-2'-deoxyuridine, 2'-0-Methyl-5-methyluridine, 2 '- O-Methylinosine, 2'-0-Methylpseudouridine, 2-Thiocytidine, 2-thio-cytosine, 3-methyl- cytosine, 4-acetyl-cytosine, 4-Thiouridine, 5-(carboxyhydroxymethyl)-uracil, 5,6- Dihydrouridine, 5-Aminoallylcytidine, 5-Aminoallyl-deoxy-uridine, 5-Bromouridine, 5- carboxymehtylaminomethyl-2-thio-uracil, 5-carboxymethylamonomethyl-uracil, 5-Chloro-Ara- cytosine, 5-Fluoro-uridine, 5-lodouridine, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-uridine, 5-methoxy- uridine, 5-methyl-2-thio-uridine, 6-Azacytidine, 6-Azauridine, 6-Chloro-7-deaza-guanosine, 6- Chloropurineriboside, 6-Mercapto-guanosine, 6-Methyl-mercaptopurine-riboside, 7-Deaza-2'- deoxy-guanosine, 7-Deazaadenosine, 7-methyl-guanosine, 8-Azaadenosine, 8-Bromo- adenosine, 8-Bromo-guanosine, 8-Mercapto-guanosine, 8-Oxoguanosine, Benzimidazole- riboside, Beta-D-mannosyl-queosine, Dihydro-uracil, Inosine, N1 -Methyladenosine, N6-([6- Aminohexyl]carbamoylmethyl)-adenosine, N6-isopentenyl-adenosine, N6-methyl-adenosine, N7-Methyl-xanthosine, N-uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methyl ester, Puromycin, Queosine, Uracil- 5-oxyacetic acid, Uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methyl ester, Wybutoxosine, Xanthosine, and Xylo- adenosine.

In the case of an analogue as described above, particular preference may be given according to the invention to those analogues that do not interfere with a further modification of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection that has been introduced.  
According to a particular embodiment, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection can contain a lipid modification. Such a lipid-modified nucleic acid typically comprises a nucleic acid as defined herein. Such a lipid-modified nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection typically further comprises at least one linker covalently linked with that nucleic acid, and at least one lipid covalently linked with the respective linker. Alternatively, the lipid-modified nucleic acid comprises an at least one nucleic acid as defined herein and at least one (bifunctional) lipid covalently linked (without a linker) with that nucleic acid.

The lipid, which may be contained in the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection (complexed or covalently bound thereto) is typically a lipid or a lipophilic residue that preferably is itself biologically active. Such lipids preferably include natural substances or compounds such as, for example, vitamins, e.g. alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), including RRR-alpha-tocopherol (formerly D-alpha- tocopherol), L-alpha-tocopherol, the racemate D,L-alpha-tocopherol, vitamin E succinate (VES), or vitamin A and its derivatives, e.g. retinoic acid, retinol, vitamin D and its derivatives, e.g. vitamin D and also the ergosterol precursors thereof, vitamin E and its derivatives, vitamin K and its derivatives, e.g. vitamin K and related quinone or phytol compounds, or steroids, such as bile acids, for example cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, dehydrocholic acid, cortisone, digoxygenin, testosterone, cholesterol or thiocholesterol. Further lipids or lipophilic residues within the scope of the present invention include, without implying any limitation, polyalkylene glycols (Oberhauser et a/., Nucl. Acids Res., 1 992, 20, 533), aliphatic groups such as, for example, C1 -C20-alkanes, C1 -C20-alkenes or C1 -C20-alkanol compounds, etc., such as, for example, dodecanediol, hexadecanol or undecyl residues (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Saison-Behmoaras et al., EMBO J, 1 991 , 1 0, 1 1 1</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kabanov et a/., FEBS Lett., 1990, 259, 327</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Svinarchuk et a/., Biochimie, 1993, 75, 49</bibl>), phospholipids such as, for example, phosphatidylglycerol, diacylphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol, sphingolipids, cerebrosides, gangliosides, or triethylammonium 1 ,2-di-0-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Manoharan et a/., Tetrahedron Lett., 1 995, 36, 3651</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Shea et a/., Nucl. Acids Res., 1 990, 1 8, 3777</bibl>), polyamines or polyalkylene glycols, such as, for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG) (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Manoharan et a/., Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, 1 995, 14, 969</bibl>), hexaethylene glycol (HEG), palmitin or palmityl residues (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mishra et a/., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1995, 1 264, 229</bibl>), octadecylamines or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol residues (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Crooke et a/., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1996, 277, 923</bibl>), and also waxes, terpenes, alicyclic hydrocarbons, saturated and mono- or poly-unsaturated fatty acid residues, etc.  
The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may likewise be stabi lized in order to prevent degradation of the nucleic acid by various approaches, particularly, when RNA or mRNA is used as a nucleic acid for the inventive purpose. It is known in the art that instability and (fast) degradation of mRNA or of RNA in general may represent a serious problem in the application of RNA based compositions. This instability of RNA is typically due to RNA-degrading enzymes, "RNAases" (ribonucleases), wherein contamination with such ribonucleases may sometimes completely degrade RNA in solution. Accordingly, the natural degradation of mRNA in the cytoplasm of cells is very finely regulated and RNase contaminations may be generally removed by special treatment prior to use of said compositions, in particular with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). A number of mechanisms of natural degradation are known in this connection in the prior art, which may be utilized as well. E.g., the terminal structure is typically of critical importance for an mRNA. As an example, at the 5' end of naturally occurring mRNAs there is usually a so-called "cap structure" (a modified guanosine nucleotide), and at the 3' end is typically a sequence of up to 200 adenosine nucleotides (the so-called poly-A tail). The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, particularly if provided as a mRNA, can therefore be stabilized against degradation by RNases by the addition of a so-called "5' cap" structure. Particular preference is given in this connection to an m7G(5')ppp (5'(A,G(5')ppp(5')A or G(5')ppp(5')G as the 5' cap" structure. However, such a modification is introduced only if a modification, for example a lipid modification, has not already been introduced at the 5' end of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, if provided as a mRNA or if the modification does not interfere with the immunogenic properties of the (unmodified or chemically modified) nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection.  
According to a further preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may contain, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, a poly-A tail on the 3' terminus of typically about 10 to 200 adenosine nucleotides, preferably about 10 to 100 adenosine nucleotides, more preferably about 20 to 100 adenosine nucleotides or even more preferably about 40 to 80 adenosine nucleotides.  
According to a further preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may contain, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, a poly-C tail on the 3' terminus of typically about 10 to 200 cytosine nucleotides, preferably about 10 to 100 cytosine nucleotides, more preferably about 20 to 70 cytosine nucleotides or even more preferably about 20 to 60 or even 10 to 40 cytosine nucleotides.  
According to another embodiment, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be modified, and thus stabilized, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, by modifying the G/C content of the nucleic acid, particularly an mRNA, preferably of the coding region thereof.  
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the G/C content of the coding region of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is modified, particularly increased, compared to the G/C content of the coding region of its particular wild type mRNA, i.e. the unmodified mRNA. The encoded amino acid sequence of the at least one mRNA is preferably not modified compared to the coded amino acid sequence of the particular wild type mRNA.  
This modification of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is based on the fact that the sequence of any mRNA region to be translated is important for efficient translation of that mRNA. Thus, the composition and the sequence of various nucleotides are important. In particular, sequences having an increased G (guanosine)/C (cytosine) content are more stable than sequences having an increased A (adenosine)/U (uracil) content. According to the invention, the codons of the mRNA are therefore varied compared to its wild type mRNA, while retaining the translated amino acid sequence, such that they include an increased amount of G/C nucleotides. In respect to the fact that several codons code for one and the same amino acid (so-called degeneration of the genetic code), the most favorable codons for the stabi lity can be determined (so-called alternative codon usage).  
Depending on the amino acid to be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, there are various possibilities for modification of the at least one mRNA sequence, compared to its wild type sequence. In the case of amino acids which are encoded by codons which contain exclusively G or C nucleotides, no modification of the codon is necessary. Thus, the codons for Pro (CCC or CCG), Arg (CGC or CGG), Ala (GCC or GCG) and Gly (GGC or GGG) require no modification, since no A or U is present.  
In contrast, codons which contain A and/or U nucleotides can be modified by substitution of other codons which code for the same amino acids but contain no A and/or U. Examples of these are: the codons for Pro can be modified from CCU or CCA to CCC or CCG;  
the codons for Arg can be modified from CGU or CGA or AGA or AGG to CGC or CGG; the codons for Ala can be modified from GCU or GCA to GCC or GCG; the codons for Gly can be modified from GGU or GGA to GGC or GGG.  
In other cases, although A or U nucleotides cannot be eliminated from the codons, it is however possible to decrease the A and U content by using codons which contain a lower content of A and/or U nucleotides. Examples of these are: the codons for Phe can be modified from UUU to UUC;  
the codons for Leu can be modified from UUA, UUG, CUU or CUA to CUC or CUG;  
the codons for Ser can be modified from UCU or UCA or AGU to UCC, UCG or AGC; the codon for Tyr can be modified from UAU to UAC;  
the codon for Cys can be modified from UGU to UGC;  
the codon for His can be modified from CAU to CAC;  
the codon for Gin can be modified from CAA to CAG;  
the codons for lie can be modified from AUU or AUA to AUC;  
the codons for Thr can be modified from ACU or ACA to ACC or ACG;  
the codon for Asn can be modified from AAU to AAC;  
the codon for Lys can be modified from AAA to AAG;  
the codons for Val can be modified from GUU or GUA to GUC or GUG;  
the codon for Asp can be modified from GAU to GAC;  
the codon for Glu can be modified from GAA to GAG;  
the stop codon UAA can be modified to UAG or UGA.  
In the case of the codons for Met (AUG) and Trp (UGG), on the other hand, there is no possibility of sequence modification.  
The substitutions listed above can be used either individually or in all possible combinations to increase the G/C content of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, compared to its particular wild type mRNA (i.e. the original sequence). Thus, for example, all codons for Thr occurring in the wild type sequence can be modified to ACC (or ACG). Preferably, however, for example, combinations of the above substitution possibilities are used: substitution of all codons coding for Thr in the original sequence (wild type m NA) to ACC 
(or ACG) and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Ser to UCC (or UCG or AGC);  
substitution of a codons coding for lie in the original sequence to AUC and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Lys to AAG and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Tyr to UAC;  
substitution of a codons coding for Val in the original sequence to GUC (or GUG) and substitution of a codons originally coding for Glu to GAG and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Ala to GCC (or GCG) and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Arg to CGC (or CGG);  
substitution of a codons coding for Val in the original sequence to GUC (or GUG) and substitution of a codons originally coding for Glu to GAG and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Ala to GCC (or GCG) and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Gly to GGC (or GGG) and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Asn to AAC;  
substitution of a codons coding for Val in the original sequence to GUC (or GUG) and substitution of a codons originally coding for Phe to UUC and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Cys to UGC and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Leu to CUG (or CUC) and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Gin to CAG and  
substitution of a codons originally coding for Pro to CCC (or CCG); etc.  
Preferably, the G/C content of the coding region of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is increased by at least 7%, more preferably by at least 15%, particularly preferably by at least 20%, compared to the G/C content of the coded region of the wild type mRNA. According to a specific embodiment at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, more preferably at least 70 %, even more preferably at least 80% and most preferably at least 90%, 95% or even 100% of the substitutable codons in the region coding for a protein or peptide as defined herein or its fragment or variant thereof or the whole sequence of the wild type mRNA sequence are substituted, thereby increasing the GC/content of said sequence. In this context, it is particularly preferable to increase the G/C content of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, to the maximum (i.e. 100% of the substitutable codons), in particular in the region coding for a protein, compared to the wild type sequence.  
According to the invention, a further preferred modification of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is based on the finding that the translation efficiency is also determined by a different frequency in the occurrence of tRNAs in cells. Thus, if so- called "rare codons" are present in the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, to an increased extent, the corresponding modified nucleic acid (sequence) is translated to a significantly poorer degree than in the case where codons coding for relatively "frequent" tRNAs are present.  
Especially if the modified nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection is in the form of a mRNA, the coding region of the modified nucleic acid is preferably modified compared to the corresponding region of the wild type mRNA such that at least one codon of the wild type sequence which codes for a tRNA which is relatively rare in the cell is exchanged for a codon which codes for a tRNA which is relatively frequent in the cell and carries the same amino acid as the relatively rare tRNA. By this modification, the sequences of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is modified such that codons for which frequently occurring tRNAs are available are inserted. In other words, according to the invention, by this modification all codons of the wild type sequence which code for a tRNA which is relatively rare in the cell can in each case be exchanged for a codon which codes for a tRNA which is relatively frequent in the cell and which, in each case, carries the same amino acid as the relatively rare tRNA.  
Which tRNAs occur relatively frequently in the cell and which, in contrast, occur relatively rarely is known to a person skilled in the art; cf. e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Akashi, Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001 , 1 1 (6): 660-666</bibl>. The codons which use for the particular amino acid the tRNA which occurs the most frequently, e.g. the Gly codon, which uses the tRNA which occurs the most frequently in the (human) cell, are particularly preferred.  
According to the invention, it is particularly preferable to link the sequential G/C content which is increased, in particular maximized, in the modified nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, with the "frequent" codons without modifying the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the coding region of the nucleic acid. This preferred embodiment allows provision of a particularly efficiently translated and stabilized (modified) nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA. The determination of a modified nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as described above (increased G/C content; exchange of tRNAs) can be carried out using the computer program explained in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 02/098443</bibl> - the disclosure content of which is included in its full scope in the present invention. Using this computer program, the nucleotide sequence of any desired nucleic acid or mRNA can be modified with the aid of the genetic code or the degenerative nature thereof such that a maximum G/C content results, in combination with the use of codons which code for tRNAs occurring as frequently as possible in the cell, and the amino acid sequence coded by the modified nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection preferably not being modified compared to the non-modified sequence. Alternatively, it is also possible to modify only the G/C content or only the codon usage compared to the original sequence. The source code in Visual Basic 6.0 (development environment used: Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 6.0 with Servicepack 3) is also described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 02/098443</bibl>. In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the A/U content in the environment of the ribosome binding site of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is increased compared to the A/U content in the environment of the ribosome binding site of its particular wild type mRNA. This modification (an increased A/U content around the ribosome binding site) increases the efficiency of ribosome binding to the nucleic acid. An effective binding of the ribosomes to the ribosome binding site (Kozak sequence: GCCGCCACCAUGG (SEQ ID NO: 3), the AUG forms the start codon) in turn has the effect of an efficient translation of the nucleic acid.  
According to a further embodiment the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, may be modified with respect to potentially destabilizing sequence elements. Particularly, the coding region and/or the 5' and/or 3' untranslated region of this nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection may be modified compared to the particular wild type nucleic acid such that is contains no destabilizing sequence elements, the coded amino acid sequence of the modified nucleic acid of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, preferably not being modified compared to its particular wild type nucleic acid. It is known that, for example, in sequences of eukaryotic RNAs destabilizing sequence elements (DSE) occur, to which signal proteins bind and regulate enzymatic degradation of RNA. For further stabilization of the modified nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, optionally in the region which encodes for a protein or a peptide as defined herein, one or more such modifications compared to the corresponding region of the wild type nucleic acid can therefore be carried out, so that no or substantially no destabilizing sequence elements are contained there. According to the invention, DSE present in the untranslated regions (3'- and/or 5'-UTR) can also be eliminated from the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, by such modifications.  
Such destabilizing sequences are e.g. AU-rich sequences (AURES), which occur in 3'-UTR sections of numerous unstable RNAs (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Caput et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1986, 83: 1670 to 1674</bibl>). The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is therefore preferably modified compared to the wild type nucleic acid such that the modified nucleic acid contains no such destabilizing sequences. This also applies to those sequence motifs which are recognized by possible endonucleases, e.g. the sequence GAACAAG, which is contained in the 3 '-UTR segment of the gene which codes for the transferrin receptor (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Binder et a/., EMBO J. 1994, 13: 1 969 to 1980</bibl>). These sequence motifs are also preferably removed in the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA.  
Also preferably, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, has, in a modified form, at least one IRES as defined above and/or at least one 5 ' and/or 3 ' stabilizing sequence, in a modified form, e.g. to enhance ribosome binding or to allow expression of different encoded proteins located on an at least one (bi- or even multicistronic) RNA of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above.  
According to the invention, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, furthermore preferably has at least one 5 ' and/or 3 ' stabilizing sequence. These stabilizing sequences in the 5' and/or 3' untranslated regions have the effect of increasing the half-life of the nucleic acid in the cytosol. These stabilizing sequences can have 100% sequence identity to naturally occurring sequences which occur in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes, but can also be partly or completely synthetic. The untranslated sequences (UTR) of the (alpha-)globin gene, e.g. from Homo sap/ens or Xenopus laevis may be mentioned as an example of stabilizing sequences which can be used in the present invention for a stabilized nucleic acid. Another example of a stabilizing sequence has the general formula (aU)CCANxCCC(U/A)PyxUC(C/U)CC (SEQ ID NO: 4), which is contained in the 3'UTR of the very stable RNA which codes for (alpha-)globin, type(l)-collagen, 1 5-lipoxygenase or for tyrosine hydroxylase (cf. Holcik et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1 997, 94: 2410 to 241 4). Such stabilizing sequences can of course be used individually or in combination with one another and also in combination with other stabilizing sequences known to a person skilled in the art. The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophi lization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is therefore preferably present as (alpha-)globin UTR (untranslated regions)-stabilized RNA, in particular as (alpha-)globin UTR-stabilized RNA.  
Nevertheless, substitutions, additions or eliminations of bases are preferably carried out with the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, using a DNA matrix for preparation of the nucleic acid by techniques of the well known site directed mutagenesis or with an oligonucleotide ligation strategy (see e.g. <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Maniatis et a/., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 2001</bibl> ). In such a process, for preparation of the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, a corresponding DNA molecule may be transcribed in vitro. This DNA matrix preferably comprises a suitable promoter, e.g. a 17 or SP6 promoter, for in vitro transcription, which is followed by the desired nucleotide sequence for the nucleic acid, e.g. mRNA, to be prepared and a termination signal for in vitro transcription. The DNA molecule, which forms the matrix of at least one RNA of interest, may be prepared by fermentative proliferation and subsequent isolation as part of a plasmid which can be replicated in bacteria. Plasmids which may be mentioned as suitable for the present invention are e.g. the plasmids pT7Ts (GenBank accession number U26404; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lai et a/., Development 1995, 121 : 2349 to 2360</bibl>), pGEM&lt;(R)&gt; series, e.g. pGEM&lt;(R)&gt;-1 (GenBank accession number X65300; from Promega) and pSP64 (GenBank accession number X65327); cf. also <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mezei and Storts, Purification of PCR Products, in: Griffin and Griffin (ed.), PCR Technology: Current Innovation, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 2001</bibl> .  
Nucleic acid molecules used according to the invention as defined above may be prepared using any method known in the art, including synthetic methods such as e.g. solid phase synthesis, as well as in vitro methods, such as in vitro transcription reactions. According to another particularly preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, may additionally or alternatively encode a secretory signal peptide. Such signal peptides are sequences, which typically exhibit a length of about 1 5 to 30 amino acids and are preferably located at the N-terminus of the encoded peptide, without being limited thereto. Signal peptides as defined herein preferably allow the transport of the protein or peptide as encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, into a defined cellular compartiment, preferably the cell surface, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the endosomal-lysosomal compartiment. Examples of secretory signal peptide sequences as defined herein include, without being limited thereto, signal sequences of classical or non- classical MHC-molecules (e.g. signal sequences of MHC I and II molecules, e.g. of the MHC class I molecule HLA-A*0201 ), signal sequences of cytokines or immunoglobulines as defined herein, signal sequences of the invariant chain of immunoglobulines or antibodies as defined herein, signal sequences of Lampl , Tapasin, Erp57, Calretikulin, Calnexin, and further membrane associated proteins or of proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the endosomal-lysosomal compartiment. Particularly preferably, signal sequences of MHC class I molecule HLA-A*0201 may be used according to the present invention.  
Any of the above modifications may be applied to the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, and further to any nucleic acid as used in the context of the present invention and may be, if suitable or necessary, be combined with each other in any combination, provided, these combinations of modifications do not interfere with each other in the respective nucleic acid. A person skilled in the art will be able to take his choice accordingly.  
The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above as well as proteins or peptides as encoded by this nucleic acid, may comprise fragments or variants of those sequences. Such fragments or variants may typically comprise a sequence having a sequence identity with one of the above mentioned nucleic acids, or with one of the proteins or peptides or sequences, if encoded by the at least one nucleic acid (sequence) of at least 5%, 1 0%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, equally more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 95% or even 97%, to the entire wild type sequence, either on nucleic acid level or on amino acid level.  
"Fragments" of proteins or peptides in the context of the present invention (encoded by a nucleic acid as defined herein) may comprise a sequence of a protein or peptide as defined above, which is, with regard to its amino acid sequence (or its encoded nucleic acid (sequence)), N-terminally, C-terminally and/or intrasequentially truncated compared to the amino acid sequence of the original (native) protein (or its encoded nucleic acid (sequence)). Such truncation may thus occur either on the amino acid level or correspondingly on the nucleic acid level. A sequence identity with respect to such a fragment as defined above may therefore preferably refer to the entire protein or peptide as defined above or to the entire (coding) nucleic acid (sequence) of such a protein or peptide. Likewise, "fragments" of nucleic acids in the context of the present invention may comprise a sequence of a nucleic acid as defined above, which is, with regard to its nucleic acid (sequence) 5'-, 3'- and/or intrasequentially truncated compared to the nucleic acid (sequence) of the original (native) nucleic acid (sequence). A sequence identity with respect to such a fragment as defined above may therefore preferably refer to the entire nucleic acid as defined above. Fragments of proteins or peptides in the context of the present invention (encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above) may furthermore comprise a sequence of a protein or peptide as defined above, which has a length of about 6 to about 20 or even more amino acids, e.g. fragments as processed and presented by MHC class I molecules, preferably having a length of about 8 to about 10 amino acids, e.g. 8, 9, or 10, (or even 6, 7, 1 1 , or 12 amino acids), or fragments as processed and presented by MHC class II molecules, preferably having a length of about 13 or more amino acids, e.g. 13, 14, 15, 1 6, 1 7, 18, 19, 20 or even more amino acids, wherein these fragments may be selected from any part of the amino acid sequence. These fragments are typically recognized by T-cells in form of a complex consisting of the peptide fragment and an MHC molecule, i.e. the fragments are typically not recognized in their native form. Fragments of proteins or peptides as defined herein (encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above) may also comprise epitopes of those proteins or peptides. Epitopes (also called "antigen determinants") in the context of the present invention are typically fragments located on the outer surface of (native) proteins or peptides as defined herein, preferably having 5 to 1 5 amino acids, more preferably having 5 to 12 amino acids, even more preferably having 6 to 9 amino acids, which may be recognized by antibodies or B-cell receptors, i.e. in their native form. Such epitopes of proteins or peptides may furthermore be selected from any of the herein mentioned variants of such proteins or peptides. In this context antigenic determinants can be conformational or discontinous epitopes which are composed of segments of the proteins or peptides as defined herein that are discontinuous in the amino acid sequence of the proteins or peptides as defined herein but are brought together in the three-dimensional structure or continuous or linear epitopes which are composed of a single polypeptide chain.  
"Variants" of proteins or peptides as defined above may be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, wherein nucleic acids of the nucleic acid, encoding the protein or peptide as defined above, are exchanged. Thereby, a protein or peptide may be generated, having an amino acid sequence which differs from the original sequence in one or more mutation(s), such as one or more substituted, inserted and/or deleted amino acid(s). Preferably, these fragments and/or variants have the same biological function or specific activity compared to the full-length native potein, e.g. its specific antigenic property. The nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above may also encode a protein or peptide as defined above, wherein the encoded amino acid sequence comprises conservative amino acid substitution(s) compared to its physiological sequence. Those encoded amino acid sequences as well as their encoding nucleotide sequences in particular fall under the term variants as defined above. Substitutions in which amino acids which originate from the same class are exchanged for one another are called conservative substitutions. In particular, these are amino acids having aliphatic side chains, positively or negatively charged side chains, aromatic groups in the side chains or amino acids, the side chains of which can enter into hydrogen bridges, e.g. side chains which have a hydroxyl function. This means that e.g. an amino acid having a polar side chain is replaced by another amino acid having a likewise polar side chain, or, for example, an amino acid characterized by a hydrophobic side chain is substituted by another amino acid having a likewise hydrophobic side chain (e.g. serine (threonine) by threonine (serine) or leucine (isoleucine) by isoleucine (leucine)). Insertions and substitutions are possible, in particular, at those sequence positions which cause no modification to the three-dimensional structure or do not affect the binding region. Modifications to a three-dimensional structure by insertion(s) or deletion(s) can easily be determined e.g. using CD spectra (circular dichroism spectra) (<bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Urry, 1985, Absorption, Circular Dichroism and ORD of Polypeptides, in: Modern Physical Methods in Biochemistry, Neuberger eta/, (ed.), Elsevier, Amsterdam</bibl>).  
Furthermore, variants of proteins or peptides as defined above, which may be encoded by the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, may also comprise those sequences, wherein nucleic acids of the nucleic acid are exchanged according to the degeneration of the genetic code, without leading to an alteration of respective amino acid sequence of the protein or peptide, i.e. the amino acid sequence or at least part thereof may not differ from the original sequence in one or more mutation(s) within the above meaning.  
In order to determine the percentage to which two sequences (nucleic acid (sequence) s, e.g. at least one nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein, or amino acid sequences, preferably their encoded amino acid sequences, e.g. the amino acid sequences of the proteins or peptides as defined above) are identical, the sequences can be aligned in order to be subsequently compared to one another. Therefore, e.g. gaps can be inserted into the sequence of the first sequence and the component at the corresponding position of the second sequence can be compared. If a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same component as is the case at a position in the second sequence, the two sequences are identical at this position. The percentage to which two sequences are identical is a function of the number of identical positions divided by the total number of positions. The percentage to which two sequences are identical can be determined using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, but not limiting, example of a mathematical algorithm which can be used is the algorithm of <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Karlin et al. (1993), PNAS USA, 90:5873-5877</bibl> or <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Altschul et a/. (1997), Nucleic Acids Res., 25:3389-3402</bibl>. Such an algorithm is integrated in the BLAST program. Sequences which are identical to the sequences of the present invention to a certain extent can be identified by this program. The inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, containing at least one nucleic acid (sequence) as defined above and mannose, may additionally contain a lactate. Such a lactate provided a surprisingly good effect on stabilization of the inventive nucleic acid (sequence) during lyophilization additional to the mannose already contained in the solution. This is particularly surprising and was not suggested by any of the prior art available. A skilled person, bearing in mind that salts typically destabilize a nucleic acid (sequence) during lyophilization, always would have expected that lactate, representing a salt, would rather destabilize than stabilize a nucleic acid (sequence) during lyophilization.

 Lactic acid is a chemical compound that plays a role in several biochemical processes. It was first isolated in 1 780 by a Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and is a carboxylic acid with a chemical formula of C3H6O3. It has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the carboxyl group, making it an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA). In solution, it can lose a proton from the acidic group, producing the lactate ion CH3CH(OH)COO&lt;~&gt;. Lactic acid is chiral and has two optical isomers. One is known as L-(+)-lactic acid or (5)-lactic acid and the other, its mirror image, is D-(-)-lactic acid or (^-lactic acid, wherein L-(+)-lactic acid is the biologically important isomer. L-lactate is constantly produced in animals from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. Industrially, lactic acid is typically produced via fermentation using among others bacteria such as Lactobacillus bacteria, etc.

As another optional component, the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above may additionally contain one or more compatible solid or liquid fillers or diluents or encapsulating compounds, which are suitable for administration to a patient to be treated. The term "compatible" as used here means that these constituents are capable of being mixed with the nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above in such a manner that no interaction occurs which would substantially reduce the pharmaceutical effectiveness of the nucleic acid under typical use conditions. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, fillers and di luents must, of course, have sufficiently high purity and sufficiently low toxicity to make them suitable for administration to a person to be treated.

Particularly preferred, the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above may be a transfection and/or injection solution. In this context, the inventive solution can be used for injection and surprisingly allows to significantly enhance the rate of (transfection and thus) expression of a protein as defined above, preferably of a protein, which is encoded by a nucleic acid as defined above and forming part of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection. Such an injection solution may contain any components as defined above for the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection. Alternatively or additionally, the inventive injection solution may be formed as a pharmaceutical composition or vaccine as defined in the following or may contain components thereof. Most preferably, the inventive injection solution can comprise or even consist of an isotonic solution as defined above and e.g. can (additionally) contain different salts (e.g. 0.5 mM to 50 mM potassium, 1 3 mM to 250 mM sodium, 0.2 mM to 1 0 mM calcium, and 0.2 mM to 10 mM magnesium).

The inventive injection solution may be administered as described in the following for a pharmaceutical composition or vaccine. According to another particularly preferred embodiment, the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above may be a solution for lyophilization of a nucleic acid as described herein. In this context, the solution for lyophilization of a nucleic acid as described herein surprisingly and significantly enhances storage stabi lity of RNA, particularly in lyophi lized form.  
According to a second aspect, the present invention provides a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence), which has been lyophi lized in an inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above. In other words, lyophilization may be carried out starting from an inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, containing at least a nucleic acid (sequence) and mannose as defined above. Furthermore, the solution may contain any further optional components as defined above, preferably lactate or a lactate derived salt as defined above.  
Upon lyophilization starting from an inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, the (residual) water content of the lyophilized nucleic sequence acid as defined herein is typically reduced to a content of about 0.5 % (w/w) to about 10 % (w/w), more preferably to a content of about 1 % (w/w) to about 5 % (w/w), even more preferably to a content of about 2 % (w/w) to about 4% (w/w), most preferably to a content of about 3 % (w/w), e.g. 3 % (w/w) + 2 % (w/w), or 3 % (w/w) +- 1 % (w/w).  
The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein typically comprises an excellent enhanced storage-stability, when compared to a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the art, which has been lyophilized without the presence of mannose, e.g. in the presence of water for injection (WFI) as described herein. The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined and as prepared herein advantageously can be stored in a temperature range of about -80[deg.]C to +60[deg.]C significantly longer, when compared to a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the art. According to the present invention, the storage-stability of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is calculated on the basis of the relative integrity of the nucleic acid (sequence). The relative integrity of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is typically defined as the relative content of the nucleic acid (sequence) exhibiting a correct length when compared to the total content of the at least one nucleic acid (sequence) in the sample. In the context of an mRNA, the relative integrity of the mRNA in the lyophilized mRNA is typically defined as the relative content of the mRNA exhibiting a correct length when compared to the total content of mRNA in the sample. The storage-stability of a nucleic acid (sequence) is typically determined on the basis of the relative integrity (over a defined or not defined period of time), wherein the nucleic acid (sequence) typically exhibits an unchangend biological activity. In the context of the present invention the storage stability is preferably regarded as complied with, if the relative integrity of the (lyophilized) nucleic acid (sequence) (s) is at least about 70 %. A relative integrity of more than 70 % meets the quality criteria of CureVac GmbH for mRNA, e.g. for mRNA exhibiting a GC-content of more than 60 % and a base length of &lt;2000 nt in RNA containing formulations. This criterium may be applied to the above definition.  
The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein, which may be lyophilized from an inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, may be prepared using a method as defined herein in the following.  
Therefore, according to a further aspect, the present invention also provides a method of lyophilization of a nucleic acid (sequence), preferably for preparation of a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein, particularly for preparation of a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) which may be lyophilized from an inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above.  
In the context of the present invention lyophilization (also termed cryodesiccation) is typically understood as a freeze-drying process, which allows removing water from a frozen sample, e.g. from an inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above containing a nucleic acid (sequence) and mannose as defined above, via sublimation as described below in further detail. The inventive method of lyophi lization of a nucleic acid as defined herein from an inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above preferably leads to an enhanced storage stability of the nucleic acid. The method typical ly comprises the following steps:  
 a) optionally providing as a nucleic acid containing sample an inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above containing a nucleic acid (sequence) and mannose as defined above, and optional ly supplemented with further omponents as defined above;  
 b) freezing the nucleic acid containing sample, obtained according to step a);  
 c) drying the frozen nucleic acid containing sample, obtained according to step b), via sublimation;  
 d) optionally floating the lyophi lized nucleic acid obtained according to step c) with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, etc., or a noble gas, such as helium, neon, argon, xenon, krypton;  
 e) optionally sealing the lyophilized nucleic acid obtained according to step c) or d). The inventive method is directed to a method of lyophilization of a nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein, preferably a nucleic acid (sequence) forming part of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above. Lyophilization (also termed cryodesiccation) is typically understood as a process, which allows removing water from a frozen sample (preferably the above defined inventive solution containing at least one nucleic acid (sequence) and mannose as defined above) in one or more steps via sublimation. In the context of the present invention, lyophilization is typically carried out by freeze-drying a sample first freezing a nucleic acid containing sample, which has been supplemented with mannose as defined herein, and then drying the nucleic acid containing sample via sublimation, optionally by reducing the surrounding pressure and/or adding enough heat to allow the frozen water in the sample to sublime directly from the solid phase to gas.  
According to an optional first step a) of the inventive method of lyophilization an inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above, containing at least one nucleic acid (sequence) and mannose as defined above, and optionally supplemented with further components as defined above, is provided. The inventive solution, particularly the at least one nucleic acid (sequence), the mannose and the optional components, is preferably as defined above. The inventive solution may be prepared e.g. by adding mannose as defined above, preferably in the above defined concentrations, to a sample containing a nucleic acid (sequence) as defined above, or by adding a nucleic acid (sequence) as defined above to a mannose containing sample, preferably in the above defined concentrations. Such an inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above has optionally been supplemented with further components, preferably as defined above.  
According to the second step b) the nucleic acid containing sample, particularly the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above containing at least one nucleic acid and mannose as defined herein, is frozen. The freezing process may be carried out by any method, which allows to (entirely) freeze the sample. In a lab, this may be done by placing the material in a freeze-drying flask and rotating the flask in a bath, called a shell freezer, which is cooled by mechanical refrigeration, dry ice and methanol, or liquid nitrogen. On a larger-scale, freezing is usually carried out using a freeze-drying machine. In this step, it is important to cool the material below its triple point, the lowest temperature at which the solid and liquid phases of the material can coexist. This ensures that sublimation rather than melting will occur in the following steps. Larger crystals are easier to freeze-dry. Usually, the freezing temperatures are in the range between -20 [deg.]C and -80 [deg.]C, preferably in the between -30 [deg.]C and -60 [deg.]C, even more preferably in the range between -40 [deg.]C and -50 [deg.]C, most preferably about -47[deg.]C.  
According to a third step c), the frozen sample is dried, typically using two drying steps, primary drying step c1 ) and secondary drying step c2). During the primary drying step cl ), free, i.e. unbound, water surrounding the nucleic acid (sequence) and optionally further components, escapes from the solution. Subsequent thereto water being bound on a molecular basis by the at least one nucleic acid (sequence) may be removed in a secondary drying step c2) by adding thermal energy. In both cases the hydration sphere around the nucleic acid (sequence) is lost.  
The primary drying step d ) may be carried out at normal pressure, e.g. in the range of about 980 to about 1045 millibar (mbar), e.g. about 1013 mbar, but also may be carried out by lowering the pressure, usually to the range of a few millibar, e.g. in the range of about 0.001 mbar to about 0.2 mbar, preferably in the range of about 0.01 mbar to about 0.1 mbar, even more preferably in the range of about 0.025 mbar to about 0.075 mbar, e.g. about 0.05 mbar. In this primary drying step, pressure is typically controlled through the application of partial vacuum. The vacuum allows speeding up sublimation, making it useful as a deliberate drying process. Furthermore, a cold condenser chamber and/or condenser plates may be used to provide (a) surface(s) for the water vapor to re-solidify on. Condenser temperatures are typically below -50 [deg.]C (-60 [deg.]F). Alternatively, instead of lowering the pressure, heat may be supplied to the sample to allow for the water to sublimate. The amount of heat necessary can be calculated using the sublimating molecules' latent heat of sublimation. In this initial drying phase, about 95% (w/w) of the water in the material is sublimated. This phase may be carried out slow to avoid applying too much heat and possible alteration or damage of the structure of the nucleic acid to be lyophilized. The heat, if applied, may be in the range of about -40 [deg.]C to about +20 [deg.]C, e.g. in the range of about -30 [deg.]C to about +20 [deg.]C, in the range of about -20 [deg.]C to about +20 [deg.]C, in the range of about -10 [deg.]C to about +10 [deg.]C, in the range of about -40 [deg.]C to about +10 [deg.]C, in the range of about -30 [deg.]C to about +10 [deg.]C, in the range of about -20 [deg.]C to about +10 [deg.]C, in the range of about -20 [deg.]C to about +/-0 [deg.]C, or in the range of about -10 [deg.]C to about +/-0 [deg.]C. As a further alternative, heat and low pressure may be applied, preferably heat in the range as defined above and a low pressure in the range as defined above.  
The secondary drying step c2) typically aims to remove unfrozen water molecules bound in the structure of the nucleic acid (sequence), since the ice (frozen water molecules) is usually removed in the primary drying step d ) above. In this secondary drying step c2), the temperature is typically raised higher than in the primary drying step, and can even be above 0 [deg.]C, to break any physico-chemical interactions that have formed between the water molecules and the frozen material. Alternatively, the pressure may be lowered in this stage to encourage desorption. According to a further alternative, heat can be applied and pressure can be lowered, preferably in the above ranges. More preferably, the heat, if applied, may be in the range of about +10 [deg.]C to about +40 [deg.]C, preferably in the range of about +25 [deg.]C to about + 35 [deg.]C, e.g. about 30 [deg.]C. The pressure, if lowered, is usually lowered to the range of a few millibars, e.g. as defined above, more preferably in the range of about 0.001 mbar to about 0.05 mbar, preferably in the range of about 0.001 mbar to about 0.025 mbar, even more preferably in the range of about 0.005 mbar to about 0.01 5 mbar, e.g. about 0.01 mbar. As a further alternative, heat and low pressure may be applied, preferably in the ranges as defined above.  
After the freeze-drying process is complete, i.e. steps b) and c), particularly cl ) and c2), are finished, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) obtained according to steps b) and c), particularly c1 ) and c2), is typically floated in an optional step d) with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, etc., or a noble gas, such as helium, neon, argon, xenon, krypton, and/or the lyophilized nucleic acid is typically sealed. For this purpose, the vacuum is usually broken, e.g. to atmospheric pressure (preferably about 1013 mbar), if low pressure was applied, and the temperature is typically adjusted to room temperature, if heat was used.  
Subsequently or alternatively to step d) of the inventive method of lyophilization, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is optionally sealed in step e) of the inventive method of lyophilization with or without an inert gas. For this purpose, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is advantageously contained in any of the above mentioned steps a), b), c), and d) (and more preferably already lyophilized) in a sealable container.  
At the end of the lyophi lization method as defined above, typically comprising optionally step a), step b) step c), particularly steps c1 ) and c2), and optionally step d) and/or step e), a lyophilized nucleic acid is preferably obtained, wherein the final (residual) water content in the inventive lyophilized nucleic acid is preferably in the range of about 0.5 % (w/w) to about 10 % (w/w), more preferably in the range of about 1 % (w/w) to about 5 % (w/w), even more preferably in the range of about 2 % (w/w) to about 4% (w/w), most preferably in the range of about 3 % (w/w), e.g. 3 % (w/w) + 2 % (w/w), or 3 % (w/w) + 1 % (w/w).  
After carrying out any of steps b) and c) a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may be obtained, which may be used for the inventive purposes. Additionally, steps d) and/or e) may be carried out. However, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may alternatively or additionally to steps d) and/or e) be reconstituted in a solution to obtain a product which is ready to be used in any of the herein mentioned applications. Therefore, according to a particularly preferred embodiment, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may again be reconstituted in a buffer as defined above or a solution for reconstitution. Preferably, such a solution for reconstitution is a solution as defined above for the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection, wherein the solution for reconstitution may contain at least one of the components as defined above for the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection except of the nucleic acid. Most preferred is an isotonic solution for reconstitution. The reconstitution may occur, e.g., after lyophilization, e.g. as a further step f) of the abovementioned method for lyophilization.

Furthermore, the inventive pharmaceutical composition may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or vehicle. In the context of the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier typically includes the liquid or non-liquid basis of the inventive inventive pharmaceutical composition. If the inventive pharmaceutical composition is provided in liquid form, the carrier will typically be pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline or buffered (aqueous) solutions, e.g phosphate, citrate etc. buffered solutions. Particularly for injection of the inventive inventive pharmaceutical composition, water or preferably a buffer, more preferably an aqueous buffer, may be used, containing a sodium salt, preferably at least 50 mM of a sodium salt, a calcium salt, preferably at least 0.01 mM of a calcium salt, and optionally a potassium salt, preferably at least 3 mM of a potassium salt. According to a preferred embodiment, the sodium, calcium and, optionally, potassium salts may occur in the form of their halogenides, e.g. chlorides, iodides, or bromides, in the form of their hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, or sulfates, etc. Without being limited thereto, examples of sodium salts include e.g. NaCI, Nal, NaBr, Na2C03, NaHC03, Na2S04, examples of the optional potassium salts include e.g. KG, Kl, KBr, K2C03, KHC03, K2S04, and examples of calcium salts include e.g. CaCI2, Cal2, CaBr2, CaC03, CaS04, Ca(OH)2. Furthermore, organic anions of the aforementioned cations may be contained in the buffer. According to a more preferred embodiment, the buffer suitable for injection purposes as defined above is an isotonic injection solution as defined herein and therefore may contain salts selected from sodium chloride (NaCI), calcium chloride (CaCl2) and optionally potassium chloride (KG), wherein further anions may be present additional to the chlorides. CaG2 can also be replaced by another salt like KG. Typically, the salts in the injection buffer are present in a concentration of at least 50 mM sodium chloride (NaCI), at least 3 mM potassium chloride (KG) and at least 0,01 mM calcium chloride (CaG2). The injection buffer may be hypertonic, isotonic or hypotonic with reference to the specific reference medium, i.e. the buffer may have a higher, identical or lower salt content with reference to the specific reference medium, wherein preferably such concentrations of the afore mentioned salts may be used, which do not lead to damage of cells due to osmosis or other concentration effects. Reference media are e.g. liquids occurring in "in vivd' methods, such as blood, lymph, cytosolic liquids, or other body liquids, or e.g. liquids, which may be used as reference media in "in vitrd' methods, such as common buffers or liquids. Such common buffers or liquids are known to a skilled person and may be as defined above. Most preferred are isotonic solutions as defined above in general may be present in an osmolality comparable to that of blood plasma, preferably in the range as defined above.

The inventive pharmaceutical composition may also be administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, e.g. including diseases of the skin or of any other accessible epithelial tissue. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs. For topical applications, the inventive pharmaceutical composition may be formulated in a suitable ointment, containing the components as defined above suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the inventive pharmaceutical composition can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream. In the context of the present invention, suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The inventive pharmaceutical composition typically comprises a "safe and effective amount" of the components of the inventive pharmaceutical composition as defined above, particularly of the at least one nucleic acid (sequence). As used herein, a "safe and effective amount" means an amount of the at least one nucleic acid (sequence) that is sufficient to significantly induce a positive modification of a disease or disorder as defined herein. At the same time, however, a "safe and effective amount" is small enough to avoid serious side- effects, that is to say to permit a sensible relationship between advantage and risk. The determination of these limits typically lies within the scope of sensible medical judgment. A "safe and effective amount" of the components of the inventive pharmaceutical composition, particularly of the at least one nucleic acid (sequence) will furthermore vary in connection with the particular condition to be treated and also with the age and physical condition of the patient to be treated, the body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the activity of the specific nucleic acid (sequence) employed, the severity of the condition, the duration of the treatment, the nature of the accompanying therapy, of the particular pharmaceutically acceptable carrier used, and similar factors, within the knowledge and experience of the accompanying doctor. The inventive pharmaceutical composition may be used for human and also for veterinary medical purposes, preferably for human medical purposes, as a pharmaceutical composition in general or as a vaccine.  
According to a specific embodiment, the inventive pharmaceutical composition may be provided as a vaccine. Such an inventive vaccine is typically composed like the inventive pharmaceutical composition, i.e. it contains at least comprising the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection as defined above containing a nucleic acid (sequence) and mannose as defined above, or the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined above and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or vehicle. Further components may be as defined above for the inventive pharmaceutical composition. The inventive vaccine preferably supports at least an innate immune response of the immune system of a patient to be treated. Additionally, the inventive vaccine furthermore may also elicit an adaptive immune response, preferably, if the at least one nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive vaccine encodes any of the above mentioned antigens (or antibodies), which elicit an adaptive immune response. The inventive vaccine may also comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, and/or vehicle as defined above for the inventive pharmaceutical composition. In the specific context of the inventive vaccine, the choice of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is determined in principle by the manner in which the inventive vaccine is administered. The inventive vaccine can be administered, for example, systemically or locally. Routes for systemic administration in general include, for example, transdermal, oral, parenteral routes, including subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intradermal and intraperitoneal injections and/or intranasal administration routes. Routes for local administration in general include, for example, topical administration routes but also intradermal, transdermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injections or intralesional, intracranial, intrapulmonal, intracardial, and sublingual injections. More preferably, vaccines herein may be administered by an intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular route. Inventive vaccines are therefore preferably formulated in liquid (or sometimes in solid) form. The suitable amount of the inventive vaccine to be administered can be determined by routine experiments with animal models. Such models include, without implying any limitation, rabbit, sheep, mouse, rat, dog and non-human primate models. Preferred unit dose forms for injection include sterile solutions of water, physiological saline or mixtures thereof. The pH of such solutions should be adjusted to about 7.4. Suitable carriers for injection include hydrogels, devices for controlled or delayed release, polylactic acid and collagen matrices. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for topical application include those which are suitable for use in lotions, creams, gels and the like. If the inventive vaccine is to be administered orally, tablets, capsules and the like are the preferred unit dose form. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for the preparation of unit dose forms which can be used for oral administration are well known in the prior art. The choice thereof will depend on secondary considerations such as taste, costs and storability, which are not critical for the purposes of the present invention, and can be made without difficulty by a person skilled in the art. The inventive vaccine can additionally contain one or more auxiliary substances in order to further increase its immunogenicity. A synergistic action of the at least one nucleic acid sequence of the inventive vaccine and of an auxiliary substance, which may be optionally contained in the inventive vaccine as described above, is preferably achieved thereby. Depending on the various types of auxiliary substances, various mechanisms can come into consideration in this respect. For example, compounds that permit the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), for example lipopolysaccharides, TNF-alpha or CD40 ligand, form a first class of suitable auxiliary substances. In general, it is possible to use as auxiliary substance any agent that influences the immune system in the manner of a "danger signal" (LPS, GP96, etc.) or cytokines, such as GM-CFS, which allow an immune response produced by the immune-stimulating adjuvant according to the invention to be enhanced and/or influenced in a targeted manner or adjuvants as defined above. Particularly preferred auxiliary substances are cytokines, such as monokines, lymphokines, interleukins or chemokines, that further promote the innate immune response, such as IL-1 , IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15, IL-16, IL-1 7, IL-18, IL-19, IL-20, IL-21 , IL-22, IL-23, IL-24, IL-25, IL-26, IL-27, IL-28, IL-29, IL-30, IL-31 , IL-32, IL-33, INF- alpha, IFN-beta, INF-gamma, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, LT-beta or TNF-alpha, growth factors, such as hGH.  
Further additives which may be included in the inventive vaccine are emulsifiers, such as, for example, Tween&lt;(R)&gt;, wetting agents, such as, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate; colouring agents; taste-imparting agents, pharmaceutical carriers; tablet-forming agents; stabilizers; antioxidants; preservatives.  
The inventive vaccine can also additionally contain any further compound, which is known to be immune-stimulating due to its binding affinity (as ligands) to human Toll-like receptors TLR1 , TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, or due to its binding affinity (as ligands) to murine Toll-like receptors TLR1 , TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR1 1 , TLR12 or TLR13.  
Another class of compounds, which may be added to an inventive vaccine in this context, may be CpG nucleic acids, in particular CpG-RNA or CpG-DNA. A CpG-RNA or CpG- DNA can be a single-stranded CpG-DNA (ss CpG-DNA), a double-stranded CpG-DNA (dsDNA), a single-stranded CpG-RNA (ss CpG-RNA) or a double-stranded CpG-RNA (ds CpG-RNA). The CpG nucleic acid is preferably in the form of CpG-RNA, more preferably in the form of single-stranded CpG-RNA (ss CpG-RNA). The CpG nucleic acid preferably contains at least one or more (mitogenic) cytosine/guanine dinucleotide sequence(s) (CpG motif(s)). According to a first preferred alternative, at least one CpG motif contained in these sequences, that is to say the C (cytosine) and the G (guanine) of the CpG motif, is unmethylated. All further cytosines or guanines optionally contained in these sequences can be either methylated or unmethylated. According to a further preferred alternative, however, the C (cytosine) and the G (guanine) of the CpG motif can also be present in methylated form. The CpG nucleic acids may be provided either in solubilized or in lyophilized form e.g. lyophilized using a method likewise as described herein for the inventive nucleic acid (sequence). Finally, another class of compounds, which may be added to an inventive vaccine in this context, may be selected from at least one pharmaceutically active component as defined above for the inventive pharmaceutical composition.  
According to a further aspect, the present invention provides several applications and uses of the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection containing a nucleic acid (sequence) and mannose, or of the inventive lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence), of the inventive pharmaceutical composition or of the inventive vaccine all preferably as defined above.

According to another specific embodiment, diseases as defined herein comprise autoimmune diseases as defined in the following. Autoimmune diseases can be broadly divided into systemic and organ-specific or localised autoimmune disorders, depending on the principal clinico-pathologic features of each disease. Autoimmune diseases may be divided into the categories of systemic syndromes, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome, Scleroderma, Rheumatoid Arthritis and polymyositis or local syndromes which may be endocrinologic (type I diabetes (Diabetes mellitus Type 1 ), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's disease etc.), dermatologic (pemphigus vulgaris), haematologic (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia), neural (multiple sclerosis) or can involve virtually any circumscribed mass of body tissue. The autoimmune diseases to be treated may be selected from the group consisting of type I autoimmune diseases or type II autoimmune diseases or type III autoimmune diseases or type IV autoimmune diseases, such as, for example, multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, type I diabetes (Diabetes mellitus Type 1 ), chronic polyarthritis, Basedow's disease, autoimmune forms of chronic hepatitis, colitis ulcerosa, type I allergy diseases, type II allergy diseases, type III allergy diseases, type IV allergy diseases, fibromyalgia, hair loss, Bechterew's disease, Crohn's disease, Myasthenia gravis, neurodermitis, Polymyalgia rheumatica, progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), Reiter's syndrome, rheumatic arthritis, psoriasis, vasculitis, etc, or type II diabetes. While the exact mode as to why the immune system induces an immune reaction against autoantigens has not been elucidated so far, there are several findings with regard to the etiology. Accordingly, the autoreaction may be due to a T-Cell bypass. A normal immune system requires the activation of B-cells by T-cells before the former can produce antibodies in large quantities. This requirement of a T-cell can be by-passed in rare instances, such as infection by organisms producing super-antigens, which are capable of initiating polyclonal activation of B-cells, or even of T-cells, by directly binding to the [beta]- subunit of T-cell receptors in a non-specific fashion. Another explanation deduces autoimmune diseases from a Molecular Mimicry. An exogenous antigen may share structural similarities with certain host antigens; thus, any antibody produced against this antigen (which mimics the self-antigens) can also, in theory, bind to the host antigens and amplify the immune response. The most striking form of molecular mimicry is observed in Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, which shares antigens with human myocardium, and is responsible for the cardiac manifestations of rheumatic fever. Additionally, according to one further specific embodiment, diseases as defined herein comprise allergies or allergic diseases, i.e. diseases related to allergies. Allergy is a condition that typically involves an abnormal, acquired immunological hypersensitivity to certain foreign antigens or allergens, such as the allergy antigens as defined above. Such allergy antigens or allergens may be selected from allergy antigens as defined above antigens derived from different sources, e.g. from animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, etc. Allergens in this context include e.g. grasses, pollens, molds, drugs, or numerous environmental triggers, etc. Allergies normally result in a local or systemic inflammatory response to these antigens or allergens and lead to immunity in the body against these allergens. Without being bound to theory, several different disease mechanisms are supposed to be involved in the development of allergies. According to a classification scheme by P. Gel I and R. Coombs the word "allergy" was restricted to type I hypersensitivities, which are caused by the classical IgE mechanism. Type I hypersensitivity is characterised by excessive activation of mast cells and basophils by IgE, resulting in a systemic inflammatory response that can result in symptoms as benign as a runny nose, to life-threatening anaphylactic shock and death. Well known types of allergies include, without being limited thereto, allergic asthma (leading to swelling of the nasal mucosa), allergic conjunctivitis (leading to redness and itching of the conjunctiva), allergic rhinitis ("hay fever"), anaphylaxis, angiodema, atopic dermatitis (eczema), urticaria (hives), eosinophilia, respiratory, allergies to insect stings, skin allergies (leading to and including various rashes, such as eczema, hives (urticaria) and (contact) dermatitis), food allergies, allergies to medicine, etc. Treatment of such allergic disorders or diseases may occur preferably by desensitizing the immune reaction which triggers a specific immune response. Such a desensitizing may be carried out by administering an effective amount of the allergen or allergic antigen encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid as defined herein, preferably, when formulated as a pharmaceutical composition, to induce a slight immune reaction. The amount of the allergen or allergic antigen may then be raised step by step in subsequent administrations until the immune system of the patient to be treated tolerates a specific amount of allergen or allergic antigen. Additionally, diseases to be treated in the context of the present invention likewise include (hereditary) diseases, or genetic diseases in general monogenetic diseases, i.e. (hereditary) diseases, or genetic diseases in general. Such (mono-)genetic diseases, (hereditary) diseases, or genetic diseases in general are typically caused by genetic defects, e.g. due to gene mutations resulting in loss of protein activity or regulatory mutations which do not allow transcription or translation of the protein. Frequently, these diseases lead to metabolic disorders or other symptoms, e.g. muscle dystrophy.

Comparison of the lyophilized samples clearly shows that storage of RNA at 60[deg.]C is not possible when lyophilized from a salt containing solution. However, addition of mannose leads to an absolutely unexpected stabilization of the RNA, although it is believed in the state of the art that presence of salts is adverse and therefore should be avoided.  
Figure 3: shows the relative integrity of mRNA lyophilized in a glucose or mannose containing solution stored at 60[deg.]C for 0 to 33 days (d). Mannose clearly increases the stability of lyophilized RNA compared to the addition of glucose. Figure 4: depicts the tumour growth in mice vaccinated with 1 ) 80% Ringer lactate as control, 2) mRNA coding for ovalbumine (not lyophilized) in 80% Ringer lactate and 3) mRNA coding for ovalbumine lyophilized in 2.5% (w/w) Mannose containing WFI and dissolved in 80% Ringer lactate. It is remarkable that the mannose-containing solution extremely enhances the efficacy of the mRNA vaccination compared to the sample without mannose. Since the samples were controlled for integrity and complex size it is guaranteed that the RNA was intact in all samples. The optimal concentration of mannose is located between 1 % and 10%.

Examples:  
The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention further. They are not intended to limit the subject matter of the invention thereto.  
Example 1 - Preparation of plasmids  
 For the present examples DNA sequences encoding Photinus pyralis luciferase as well as DNA sequences encoding Ovalbumin were prepared and used for subsequent in vitro transcription reactions and expression studies.  
According to a first preparation, the DNA sequence corresponding to pCV19-Ppluc(GQ- muag-A70-C30 was prepared, which encodes the Photinus pyralis luciferase coding sequence. The constructs were prepared by modifying the wild type Photinus pyralis luciferase encoding DNA sequence by introducing a GC-optimized sequence for a better codon usage and stabilization, stabilizing sequences derived from alpha-globin-3'-UTR (muag (mutated alpha-globin-3'-UTR)), a stretch of 70 x adenosine at the 3'-terminal end (poly-A-tail) and a stretch of 30 x cytosine at the 3'- terminal end (poly-C-tail), corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1 (see Figure 5). The sequence of the final DNA construct had a length of 1 857 nucleotides. The corresponding mRNA sequence was termed "pCV19-Ppluc(GC)-muag-A70-C30" (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) (see Figure 5).  
According to a second preparation, the DNA sequence corresponding to CAP-GgOva(GC)- muag-A70-C30 was prepared, which encodes to the Ovalbumin coding sequence. Therefore, a basic DNA construct was prepared corresponding to CAP-GgOva(GC)-muag- A70-C30 by introducing into the underlying wild type sequence construct stabilizing sequences derived from alpha-globin-3'-UTR (muag (mutated alpha-globin-3'-UTR)), a stretch of 70 x adenosine at the 3'-terminal end (poly-A-tail) and a stretch of 30 x cytosine at the 3'- terminal end (poly-C-tail), leading to a sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 2 (see Figure 6). The corresponding mRNA sequence was termed CAP-GgOva(GC)-muag- A70-C30 (SEQ ID NO: 2) (see Figure 6).  
Both sequences contain following sequence elements: - the coding sequence encoding Photinus pyralis luciferase (SEQ ID NO:  
 1 ) or Gallusgallus Ovalbumin (SEQ ID NO: 2);  
 - stabilizing sequences derived from alpha-globin-3'-UTR (muag (mutated alpha-globin-3'-UTR));  
 . 70 x adenosine at the 3'-terminal end (poly-A-tail);  
 - 30 x cytosine at the 3'- terminal end (poly-C-tail).  
Example 2 - In vitro transcription:  
 The respective DNA plasmids prepared according to Example 1 were transcribed in vitro using T7-Polymerase (T7-Opti mRNA Kit, CureVac, Tubingen, Germany) following the manufactures instructions. Subsequently the mRNA was purified using PureMessenger&lt;(R)&gt; (CureVac, Tubingen, Germany).  
Example 3 - Lyophylisation:  
The PureMessenger&lt;(R)&gt; purified and precipitated mRNA obtained according to Examples 1 and 2 coding for Photinus pyralis luciferase (Luc mRNA) (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) or Ovalbumin (SEQ ID NO: 2) were prepared for transfection and expression tests.  
The PureMessenger&lt;(R)&gt; purified and precipitated mRNA obtained according to Examples 1 and 2 coding for Photinus pyralis luciferase (Luc mRNA) (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) or Ovalbumin (SEQ ID NO: 2) was dissolved in water for injection (WFI) to 5 g/l. Subsequently the mRNA was diluted with WFI (water for injection) or salt solution (see Figure 2), with addition of glucose, trehalose, mannite or mannose. Aliquots of these solutions were lyophilized (Controls were frozen in liquid nitrogen or kept in solution). The locked cups were stored for the indicated time at 60[deg.]C. The resuspension was conducted with WFI.  
Example 4 - In vivo expression of the RNA constructs  
 In the present experiment following solutions for lyophilization were used:  
 - WFI (water for injection): purified mRNA coding for luciferase with a concentration of 4.9 g l in WFI was diluted with WFI to a final mRNA concentration of 0.05 g/l. 
- Buffer containing mannose: 0.25 g mannose was diluted with 10 ml WFI and passed through a syringe filter tip 0.22 [mu][iota][eta] resulting in a sterile 2.5% (w/w) mannose containing solution. Purified mRNA coding for luciferase with a concentration of 4.9 g/l in WFI was diluted with the sterile 2.5% (w/w) mannose solution to a final mRNA concentration of 0.05 g/l.  
 - Buffer containing trehalose: 0.5 g trehalose was diluted with 10 ml WFI and passed through a syringe filter tip 0.22 pm resulting in a sterile 5% (w/w) trehalose containing solution. Purified mRNA coding for luciferase with a concentration of 
4.9 g/l in WFI was diluted with the sterile 5% (w/w) trehalose solution to a final mRNA concentration of 0.05 g/l.  
 - Buffer containing mannite: 0.5 g mannite was diluted with 10 ml WFI and passed through a syringe filter tip 0.22 pm resulting in a sterile 5% (w/w) mannite containing solution. Purified mRNA coding for luciferase with a concentration of 
4.9 g/l in WFI was diluted with the sterile 5% (w/w) mannite solution to a final mRNA concentration of 0.05 g/l. The dilution errors for mannose, trehalose, and mannite were neclectable.  
 - Buffer control Ringer lactate solution 80% in WFI was used (not lyophilized);

 The mRNA containing buffers were frozen by liquid nitrogen for at least 5 min and lyophilized over night at 0.08 mbar in a freeze drier Alpha 1 -2 (Fa. Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode, Germany). The lyophilisates were dissolved with a sterile salt containing solution (5 mM KG, 2 mM CaG2, 2 mM MgG2, 130 mM NaCl in WFI).  
In vivo expression:  
 Each group (2 mice per group) of 7 week old female balb/c mice were treated by intradermal injection with 100 pi of each sample. After 24h mice were killed and the injected tissue was collected and lysed as described ahead. Tissue samples were crushed by a mill after freezing in liquid nitrogen and lysed afterwards by adding 800 pi of lysing buffer (25 mM Tris HCL, 2 mM EDTA, 10%Glycerol, 1 % Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.5-7.8). The lysates were shaked for 6 min and spinned down for another 10 min at 4[deg.]C and 13500 rpm. The supernatants were measured with a luminometer LB9507 and analyzed as grouped analysis using 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test. The results are shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 shows the in vivo luciferase expression in balb/c mice 1 ) buffer control: Ringer-lactate 2) mRNA/WFI: mRNA coding for luciferase lyophilized in WFI (water for injection) and dissolved in salt containing solution 3) mRNA/trehalose: mRNA coding for luciferase lyophilized in WFI containing 5% trehalose and dissolved in salt containing solution 4) mRNA/mannose: mRNA coding for luciferase lyophilized in WFI containing 2.5% mannose and dissolved in salt containing solution 5) mRNA/mannite: mRNA coding for luciferase lyophilized in WFI containing 5% mannite and dissolved in salt containing solution. Discussion:  
 After an intradermal injection in balb/c mice of mRNA coding for Photinus pyrialis luciferase (PpLuc RNA) (0.05 g L) dissolved in a salt solution (5 mM KCI, 130 mM NaCI, 2 mM Ca, 2 mM Mg) which was lyophilized in WFI (water of injection) plus 2.5% (w/w) mannose, the luciferase expression increases by a factor of more than 20 compared to an injection of mRNA which was lyophilized in WFI without mannose (see Figure 1 ). Other sugars (trehalose and mannite) which were added to the solution before lyophilization could not improve the expression of the encoded protein.  
Example 5 - Determination of the stability of RNA:  
In the following a comparison of the stability of RNA in solution and lyophilized RNA and a comparison of the stability of RNA lyophilized from mannose or glucose containing solution was carried out. a) Comparison of the stability of RNA in solution and lyophilized RNA:  
 mRNA was complexed with protamine according to the following protocol. RNA was first mixed at a ratio 4:1 RNA/Protamine (w/w) with a protamine containing salt solution (5mM KCI, 2mM CaCI, 2mM MgCI, 130mM NaCI) to a final RNA concentration of 0.4 g/l. Mannose was added to the solution in a final concentration of 2.5% (w/w).  
The solution was divided into 65 [mu][Iota] containing aliquots in 2 ml polypropylene tubes with crewed caps. Half of the samples were frozen by liquid nitrogen for at least 5 min and lyophilized over night at 0.08 mbar in a freeze drier Alpha 1 -2 (Fa. Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode, Germany). Liquid and lyophilized samples were stored at 60[deg.]C for 1 to 5 weeks. Every week 2 aliquotes of each lyophilisat were dissolved in 65 [mu][Iota] WFI. 50 [mu][Iota] of each sample were precipitated with 2-propanole. The pellets were diluted in 50 [mu][Iota] WFI again and for 1 [mu]g of each sample an agarose gel electrophoresis was conducted. After separation the relative integrity of RNA was measured as the relation between full length product and total RNA calculated in %. 70% relative integrity was found to be a typical limit for an intact product accepted by the authorities.  
The results are described in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows the relative integrity of RNA in mRNA/protamine containing samples dissolved in salt containing solution (5mM K, 2mM Ca, 2mM Mg, 130mM Na) and subsequently 1 ) lyophilized from salt solution (1 = RNA-Lyo-Salt) 2) stored in salt solution (2 = RNA-Sol-Salt) 3) lyophilized from 2.5% mannose containing salt solution (3 = RNA-Lyo_MnSalt) or 4) stored in 2.5% mannose containing salt solution (4 = RNA-Sol_MnSalt).  
Discussion:  
 It is remarkable that RNA cannot be stored at 60[deg.]C neither in the salt solution nor in the mannose containing salt solution. Comparison of the lyophilized samples clearly shows that storage of RNA at 60[deg.]C is not possible when lyophilized from a salt containing solution. However, addition of mannose leads to an absolutely unexpected stabilization of the RNA, although it is believed in the state of the art that presence of salts is adverse and therefore should be avoided.  
Comparison of the stability of RNA lyophilized from mannose or glucose containing solution  
mRNA was complexed with protamine in the following protocol. RNA was mixed at a ratio 4:1 RNA/Protamine (w/w) with a diluted protamine solution containing protamine, WFI and mannose or glucose to a final RNA concentration of 0.4 g/l and 5% (w/w) mannose or 5% (w/w) glucose.  
The solution was divided into 65 [mu][Iota] containing aliquots in 2 ml polypropylene tubes with crewed caps, frozen by liquid nitrogen for at least 5 min and lyophilized over night at 0.08 mbar in a freeze drier Alpha 1 -2 (Fa. Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode, Germany). The samples were stored at 60[deg.]C for 0-33 days. At the indicated time points 2 aliquotes of each sample were dissolved in 65 [mu][Iota] WFI. 50 [mu][Iota] of each sample were precipitated with 2-propanole. The pellets were diluted in 50 [mu][Iota] WFI again and for 1 [mu]g of each sample an agarose gel electrophoresis was conducted. After separation the relative integrity of RNA was measured as the relation between full length product and total RNA calculated in %. 70% relative integrity was found to be a typical limit for an intact product accepted by the authorities.  
The results are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 depicts the relative integrity of mRNA lyophilized in a glucose or mannose containing solution stored at 60[deg.]C for 0 to 33 days (d). Discussion:  
 This experiment shows that mannose clearly increases the stability of lyophilized RNA compared to the addition of glucose. This is remarkable because mannose is the epimer of glucose and therefore nobody skilled in the art would have expected that mannose is more effective in stabilization of RNA than glucose.  
Example 6 - Tumour challenge:  
 The samples used in this experiment were:  
 - OVA-RNActive in RiLa: mRNA coding for Gallus gallus ovalbumine complexed with protamine and dissolved in 80% Ringer lactate  
 . OVA-RNActive lyophilized in 2.5% (w/w) mannose: mRNA coding for Callus gallus ovalbumine complexed with protamine, lyophilized in WFI containing 2.5% (w/w) mannose and dissolved in 80% Ringer lactate  
 - RiLa control: 80% Ringer lactate was used as control mRNA coding for ovalbumine was complexed with protamine in the following protocol. RNA was mixed at a ratio 4:1 RNA Protamine (w/w). Mannose was added to a final concentration of 2.5% (w/w). The mannose containing RNA solution was aliquoted into a borosilicate glas typ I and frozen by liquid nitrogen for at least 5 min and lyophilized at 0.055 mbar for 22 h. Sample plates were kept at room temperature for 1 7 h and were than elevated to 35[deg.]C for another 5 h. The chamber was flooded with dry argon and the samples were closed under this atmosphere by a bromobutyl stopper. The lyophilized and non-lyophilized samples were stored in an exsiccator at 4-8[deg.]C and the lyophilized sample was dissolved in 80% Ringer lactate prior to use. Prior use the samples were controlled for relative integrity by agarose gel chromatography and complex size by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK).  
7 week old C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated intradermally with 2 cycles (Prime day 1 / Boost day 9) of 80 [mu][Iota] formulations. As a negative control 80 [mu][Iota] 80% Ringer lactate without any RNA were injected. At day 1 5 1 x10&lt;6&gt; E.G7-OVA cells (tumour cells which stably express ovalbumine) per mice were implanted subcutaneously. Tumour growth was monitored by measuring the tumor size in 3 dimensions using a calliper.  
The results are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 depicts the tumour growth in mice vaccinated with 1 ) 80% Ringer lactate as control, 2) mRNA coding for ovalbumine (not lyophilized) in 80% Ringer lactate and 3) mRNA coding for ovalbumine lyophilized in 2.5% (w/w) mannose containing WFI and dissolved in 80% Ringer lactate.  
Discussion:  
 It is remarkable that a mannose-containing solution extremely enhances the efficacy of the mRNA vaccination compared to the sample without mannose. Since the samples were controlled for integrity and complex size it is guaranteed that the RNA was intact in all samples.  
The optimal concentration of mannose is located between 1 % and 10%. The formulation of the injection solution can contain different salts (e.g. 0.5 mM to 50 mM potassium, 13 mM to 250 mM sodium, 0.2 mM to 10 mM calcium, and 0.2 mM to 10 mM magnesium). Different injection solutions can be utilized, e.g. PBS, HBSS, Ringer-Lactat.</p></description></fulltext-document>
