The present invention is directed to the lyophilization of nucleic acids in lactate-containing solutions or formulations. The present invention is particularly suitable for enhancing and improving storage and shipping capabilities of nucleic acids for multiple purposes. The present invention is furthermore directed to methods of lyophilization suitable to prepare such inventive lyophilized nucleic acids, to the use of such lyophilized nucleic acids in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, to first and second medical indications using such lyophilized nucleic acids and to kits, particularly to kit of parts, comprising such lyophilized nucleic acids. In gene therapy and many other therapeutically relevant biochemical and biotechnological applications the use of nucleic acids for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes is of major importance. As an example, rapid progress has occurred in recent years in the field of gene therapy and promising results have been achieved. In this context, the final dosage form providing these nucleic acids but also production, transport and storage thereof are of particular interest. 
It is understood that nucleic acids, e.g., naked DNA, introduced into a patient' circulatory system are typically not stable and therefore have little chance of affecting most disease processes (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Poxon et a/., Pharmaceutical development and Technology, 5(1 ), 1 1 5- 122 (2000)</bibl>). This obstacle has led to the development of a number of gene delivery systems, e.g. liposomal delivery, gene delivery vectors, etc., which allow increasing metabolic activities. However, these systems and formulations are typically not suitable for long-term storage or storage above temperatures of -20[deg.]C or even -80[deg.]C and thus require methods such as lyophilization to increase shelf life. 
Lyophilization is a worldwide known and recognized method in the art to enhance storage stability of temperature sensitive biomolecules, such as nucleic acids. During lyophilization, typically water is removed from a frozen sample containing nucleic acids via sublimation. The process of lyophilization is usually characterized by a primary and a secondary drying step. During the primary drying step, free, i.e. unbound, water surrounding the nucleic acid and optionally further components, escapes from the solution. Subsequent thereto water being bound on a molecular basis by the nucleic acids may be removed in a secondary drying step by adding thermal energy. In both cases the hydration sphere around the nucleic acids is lost. 
During lyophilization the sample containing nucleic acids is initially cooled below the freezing point of the solution and accordingly of the water contained therein. As a result, the water freezes. Dependent on temperature, rate of cooling down (freezing rate), and the time for freezing, the crystal structure of water is changed. This exhibits physical stress on the nucleic acid and other components of the solution, which may lead to a damage of the nucleic acid, e.g. breakage of strands, loss of supercoiling, etc. Furthermore, due to the decrease of volume and loss of the hydration sphere, autocatalytic degradation processes are favored e.g. by traces of transition metals. Additionally, significant changes of pH are possible by concentration of traces of acids and bases. 
As discussed above, lyophilization involves two stresses, freezing and drying. Both are known to damage nucleic acids, such as non-viral vectors or plasmid DNA but also DNA. In the literature, a number of cryoprotectants and lyoprotectants are discussed for lyophilization purposes to prevent these damages. In this context, cryoprotectants are understood as excipients, which allow influencing the structure of the ice and/or the eutectical temperature of the mixture. Lyoprotectants are typically excipients, which partially or totally replace the hydration sphere around a molecule and thus prevent catalytic and hydrolytic processes. In this context, carbohydrates such as sugars play a central role as lyoprotectants. However, when using cryoprotectants and lyoprotectants, no general rule may be applied with respect to their impact on different groups of compounds. Therefore, an optimal formulation has to be found using empirical methods. In the specific context of DNA, lyophilization causes the removal of the hydration sphere around the DNA, wherein it appears that there are approximately 20 water molecules per nucleotide pair bound most tightly to DNA. These water molecules do not form an ice-like structure upon low-temperature cooling. Upon DNA dehydration over hygroscopic salts at 0% relative humidity, only five or six water molecules remain (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Tao et al, Biopolymers, 28, 1019-1030 (1989)</bibl>). Lyophilization may increase the stability of DNA under long-term storage, but may also cause some damage upon the initial lyophilization process, potentially through changes in the DNA secondary structure, breaks of the nucleic acid chain(s) or the concentration of reactive elements such as contaminating metals. Lyophilization can also cause damage upon the initial lyophilization process in other nucleic acid molecules, e.g. RNA. Agents that can substitute for non-freezable water, such as trehalose, can demonstrate cryoprotective properties for DNA and other molecules during lyophilization of intact bacteria (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Israeli et al, Cryobiology, 30, 519-523 (1993)</bibl>; or <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Rudolph et al, Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 245, 134-143 (1986)</bibl>). Other cryoprotective agents, such as polyols, amino acids, sugars, and lyotropic salts, are preferentially excluded from contact with protein surfaces but are also capable of stabilizing enzymes during lyophilization by undefined mechanisms (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Carpenter et al., Cryobiology 27, 219-231 (1990)</bibl>). It is possible that these agents that act as cryoprotectants to proteins may also act to stabilize nucleic acids upon lyophilization. 
The complex of DNA and cationic liposomes requires lyoprotectants to maintain transfection efficiency after lyophilization (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Anchordoquy et al, Pharm. Res., 14(1 1 ), S641 - S642 (1997)</bibl>). Moreover, other gene delivery systems containing polyethylenimine, polylysine, and adenovirus particles require cryoprotection to maintain transfection efficiency (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Talsma et al, Int. J. Pharm., 157(2), 233-238 (1997)</bibl>). However, it is unclear if this effect is due only to stabilization of the liposomal component of the mixture or the plasmid DNA component may itself be damaged by lyophilization in the absence of carbohydrate lyoprotectants, because lyoprotectants may serve a variety of protective roles. 
In this context, Poxon et al. (2000, supra) investigated the effect of lyophilization on plasmid DNA activity. Poxon et al. (2000, supra) hypothetized, that a change in the DNA conformation from supercoiled to open circular and linear form would be indicative of damage of the plasmid DNA. However, the percentage of supercoiled DNA did not change after lyophilization and subsequent DMED treatment, suggesting that other effects drew responsible for the loss of transfection efficiency. Poxon et al. (2000, supra) found that a decrease in plasmid DNA activity as measured by an in vitro transfection assay can be ameliorated by the use of carbohydrates during lyophilization of the plasmid DNA. As a particular example, a statistically significant loss of transfection efficiency (p&lt;0.05) by lyophilization of pRL-CMV plasmid DNA could completely be restored by using mono- and disaccharides during lyophi lization. As lyoprotectants, glucose (monosaccaride), sucrose and lactose (disaccharides) were used. Poxon et al. (2000, supra), however, only carried out investigations with lyophilized plasmid DNA using carbohydrate lyoprotectants. No other nucleic acids, such as RNA or PNA, were discussed. Poxon et al. (2000, supra), did also not investigate if the addition of sugars to the lyophilization affects the stability of the lyophilized plasmid DNA. A similar approach was carried out by Molina et al. (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Molina et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 2004 Sep, 93(9), 2259-73</bibl>). Molina et al. (2004, supra) lyophilized lipid/DNA complexes in the presence of the carbohydrates glucose, sucrose and trehalose, i.e. mono- or disaccharide sugars. Molina et al. (2004, supra) furthermore used a specific liposome preparation, preferably liposomes containing DOTAP in a 1 :1 (w/w) ratio with the zwitterionic lipid DOPE, wherein a 3:1 lipid:DNA weight ratio was applied. The results in Molina et al. (2004, supra) showed that even though lyophilized samples prepared using these carbohydrates maintained their particle size at low temperatures (i.e. -20[deg.]C, 4[deg.]C) the transfection activity of these lyophilized lipoplexes gradually declined with time regardless of their storage temperature. In other words, no long-term storage is possible using these carbohydrates, particularly glucose, sucrose and trehalose, i.e. mono- or disaccharide sugars. Surprisingly, the loss of activity was observed in all formulations and sometimes even under conditions that maintained particle size. Molina et al. (2004, supra) concluded that due to the glass like structure of the lyophilized DNA and considering that reactions requiring positional specificity would be sharply inhibited by the reduced molecular mobility in the glass, a highly reactive species, e.g. free radicals, may have a severe impact on transfection activity. They suspected that mobility of such highly reactive species is not dramatically restricted in a glassy formulation, wherein the high free volume of a glass might facilitate diffusion of small free radical species (e.g. OH&lt;*&gt;, O2&lt;*&gt;), and thereby permitting significant levels of strand breakage to occur during storage. They also hypothesized that trace amounts of transition metals (e.g. Cu&lt;2+&gt;, Fe&lt;3+&gt;) in excipients are responsible for this phenomenon and may catalyze the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the Fenton reaction (see Molina et al., 2004, supra). <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Maitani et al. (see Maitani et al., Int. J. Pharm. 356 (2008), 69-75</bibl>) disclose cationic lipid- based gene delivery systems and investigate, similar to Molina eta/. (2004, supra), the effect of sugars on the storage stability of lyophilized liposome/DNA complexes with high transfection efficiency. Particularly, Maitani et al. (2008, supra) carried out lyophilization experiments and examined stability of lyophilized liposome/DNA complexes with sucrose, isomaltose and isomaltotriose at different temperatures over 50 days, and determined which sugars could inhibit aggregation and maintain the transfection activity of plasmid DNA during preservation at temperatures above their glass transition temperatures (Tg). As a result, Maitani et al. (2008, supra) found that liposome/DNA complexes with sucrose, prepared according to the dehydration rehydration vesicle (DRV) method, could be stored even at 50[deg.]C without a large loss of transfection activity. Isomaltose and isomaltotriose were selected as excipients because their Tg values were higher than that of sucrose and therefore, there were expected to exhibit a greater stabilizing effect. 
In the publication of Quaak et al. (see <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Quaak et al, Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 70 (2008) 4329-438</bibl>) the authors investigate the GMP production of a plasmid DNA construct pDERMATT (plasmid DNA encoding recombinant MART-1 and Tetanus toxin fragment-c) for vaccination against melanoma in a phase I clinic trial. One purpose of the study was the provision of a reproducible process to manufacture pharmaceutical grade plasmid DNA but also a stable dosage form for the use in clinical trials. As requirements, the plasmid product must be of high purity, essentially in its supercoiled form and free of host-cell proteins, chromosomal RNA, RNA, preferably without the use of RNase A, and endotoxins. Quaak et al. (2008, supra) used as excipients sucrose, trehalose, mannitol and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), wherein lyophilization of formulations containing sucrose as a bulking agent in a concentration of (2%) turned out to result in a stable product. The resulting product showed immunogenicity and a strong MART-1 specific CTL response in a murine model. 
Even though many available prior art documents discuss the stabilization of nucleic acids during lyophilization and long-term storage in the context of plasmid DNA, only few publications focus on stabilization of other nucleic acids, such as RNAs. In this context, provision of stabilization of RNAs during lyophilization and long-term storage is particularly important. As generally known, the physico chemical stability of RNAs in solution is extremely low. RNA is typically completely degraded even in the absence of RNases when stored a few days at room temperature. To avoid such degradation and a loss of function, particularly when regarding coding RNAs such as mRNAs the RNA is to be stored at -20[deg.]C or even -80[deg.]C. Furthermore, when using nucleic acids, particularly RNAs, as an active agent in a pharmaceutical composition or a vaccine, 
Yadava et a/, (see <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Yadava et a/., AAPS Pharm. Sci. Tech., Vol. 9, No. 2, June 2008, pp. 335- 341</bibl> ) discuss the effect of lyophilization and freeze-thawing on the stability of siRNA- liposome complexes. The lipoplexes in Yadava et a/. (2008, supra), when lyophilized in the presence of sugars, such as glucose or sucrose, could be lyophilized and reconstituted without loss of transfection efficacy but in ionic solutions, they lost 65-75% of their biological functionality. The lyophilization process thus did not appear to alter siRNA's intrinsic biological activity. However, the underlying principle of RNA interference (RNAi) is the post-transcriptional gene silencing due to the cleavage of mRNA, triggered by small double stranded RNA molecules (small interfering RNAs, siRNAs), homologous in sequence to the target mRNA, which are typically less sensitive to loss of biological activity due to breakage and (partial) degradation than mRNAs or RNAs in general, as these siRNAs may even exhibit a biological activity, when their (short) sequence is partial ly degraded. Yadava et a/. (2008, supra), did not investigate if the addition of sugars or salts affects the stability of the lyophilized siRNA. 
Despite little success shown for some DNA derived nucleic acids, all the above approaches utilize carbohydrates, particularly sugars such as mono- or disaccharides, as a lyoprotectants to stabilize these nucleic acids during lyophilization. However, when using sugars, particularly when using mono- or disaccharides, a theoretical sugar/nucleic acid mass ratio of about 1 000 to about 4000 is required to optimally conserve the biological activity of the nucleic acids (see Molina et a/. (2004, supra); and Poxon et a/. (2000, supra)). Unfortunately, this mass ratio, even if preferred, is not possible for nucleic acids above a concentration of 2 g/l due to the high concentration and due to the restricted solubility of sugar in water. When using more suitable concentrations of sugar or sugar/nucleic acid mass ratios of about 4, a decrease of biological activity could be observed. Data furthermore show that during (long-term) storage of lyophilized DNA vectors the content of supercoiled DNA is accompanied by a loss of biological activity. An additional problem originates from the use of salts in such solutions. The use of salts generally exhibits a destabilizing effect on peptides and complexes (see e.g. Yadava et al, (2008 supra)), but also on many nucleic acid solutions, and is thus avoided. However, when neutralizing the electrostatic interactions of biomolecules or their complexes, aggregation may occur quite easily and also may be accompanied by a loss of activity and degradation. 
Additionally, even though storage at -20[deg.]C or even -80[deg.]C is technically possible, such storage does not allow long-term storage without a significant loss of biological activity. It also requires extraordinary effort and costs. Such costs, however, cannot be afforded by all commercial and sometimes private parties. This particularly applies to tropical regions or third-world countries, where expenses have to be kept low for economical reasons and due to limited energy available in these regions. Furthermore, there may be the need to transport such nucleic acids in cases, where not much space (or energy) is available for storage, e.g. in cases of the situation "production to bedside" or even "bench to bedside". This also may be the case for short but also for long-term expeditions, for long-term storage of nucleic acids in databases, registers or deposit institutions, e.g. databases for biological researchers, governmental or national databases of criminal offenders, etc. Long-term storage capablities of RNA furthermore opens a various field of applications and treatments involving RNAs as active substances, e.g. (tumor)vaccination using RNAs, gene therapy using RNAs, etc. Storage at temperatures above 4[deg.]C, for both DNA and RNA and any further nucleic acid, such as PNAs, therefore may entail a valuable economical and logistical advantage in all of these different aspects. 
Summarizing the above, there is a long-lasting and urgent need to provide means, which allow (a skilled person) to lyophilize nucleic acids more efficiently without (a significant) loss of function of these nucleic acids and which allow for a (long-term) storage of these nucleic acids, particularly of RNAs, at temperatures above -80[deg.]C or -20[deg.]C, preferably above 4[deg.]C or even at room temperature or higher temperatures. The object of the present invention is solved by the attached claims. According to a particular embodiment, the problem underlying the present invention is solved by a lyophilized nucleic acid, which has been lyophilized from a lactate containing solution. Preferably, the inventive lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is prepared using a method as described herein, particularly a method of lyophilization of a nucleic acid according to the present invention. 
This solution is particularly surprising and was not suggested by any of the above prior art documents. A skilled person, bearing in mind that salts typically destabilize a nucleic acid during lyophilization, always would have expected that lactate, representing a salt, would rather destabilize than stabilize a nucleic acid during lyophilization. Even more surprisingly, it turned out to the inventors, that the use of lactate retrieved better results than the use of glucose, which typically has been used during lyophilization. 
In the context of the present invention lyophilization (also termed cryodesiccation) is typically understood as a freeze-drying process, which allows removing water from a frozen sample (containing at least one nucleic acid and a lactate containing solution) via sublimation as described below in further detail. 
For the inventive purpose, a lactate as defined herein may be any lactate available in the art. Preferably, a lactate within the context of the present invention is defined as a chemical compound, particularly a salt, derived from free lactic acid (lUPAC systematic name: 2- hydroxypropanoic acid), also known as milk acid, including its optical isomers L-(+)-lactic acid, (5)-lactic acid, D-(-)-lactic acid or ( c)-lactic acid, more preferably its biologically active optical isomer L-(+)-lactic acid, wherein the salt or an anion thereof, preferably may be selected from sodium-lactate, potassium-lactate, or Al3&lt;+&gt;-lactate, NH4&lt;+&gt;-lactate, Fe-lactate, Li-lactate, Mg-lactate, Ca-lactate, Mn-lactate or Ag-lactate, or selected from Ringer's lactate (RiLa), lactated Ringer's solution (main content sodium lactate, also termed "Hartmann's Solution" in the UK), acetated Ringer's solution, or selected from lactate containing water, or ortho-lactate-containing (isotonic) solutions (e.g. for injection purposes), etc. The chemical structure of lactic acid is as follows: </p><p> 
 Lactic acid is a chemical compound that plays a role in several biochemical processes. It was first isolated in [Iota] 780 by a Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and is a carboxylic acid with a chemical formula of C3H603. It has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the carboxyl group, making it an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA). In solution, it can lose a proton from the acidic group, producing the lactate ion CH3CH(OH)COO&lt;"&gt;. Lactic acid is chiral and has two optical isomers. One is known as L-(+)-lactic acid or (5)-lactic acid and the other, its mirror image, is D-(-)-lactic acid or (A)-lactic acid, wherein L-(+)-lactic acid is the biologically important isomer. L-lactate is constantly produced in animals from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. Industrially, lactic acid is typically produced via fermentation using among others bacteria such as Lactobacillus bacteria, etc. 
The lactate containing solution as defined herein, which is used for preparation of the inventive lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein, typically comprises a lactate concentration prior to lyophilization in the range of about 3 mM to about 300 mM, preferably in the range of about 5 mM to about 200 mM, more preferably in the range of about 10 mM to about 150 mM, even more preferably about 15 mM to about 35 mM, and most preferably 20 mM to about 31 mM. 
Alternatively, the lactate containing solution as defined herein, which is used for preparation of the inventive lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein, typically comprises a Ringer's lactate concentration (or a concentration of any of the afore mentioned lactate containing solutions) prior to lyophilization e.g. in the range of about 10% (w/w) to about 100% (w/w), e.g. in the range of about 20% (w/w) to about 100% (w/w), in the range of about 30% (w/w) to about 100% (w/w), in the range of about 40% (w/w) to about 100% (w/w), in the range of about 50% (w/w) to about 90% (w/w), preferably in the range of about 60% (w/w) to about 90% (w/w), more preferably in the range of about 70% (w/w) to about 90% (w/w), e.g. about 80% (w/w), of Ringer's lactate (or the afore mentioned lactate containing solution). In this context, Ringer's lactate (100 % (w/w)) is typically defined as a solution comprising 131 mM Na&lt;+&gt;, 5,36 mM K&lt;+&gt;, 1 ,84 mM Ca&lt;2+&gt;, and 28,3 mM Lactate). The present invention is directed to a lyophilized nucleic acid, which has been lyophilized from a lactate containing solution. In the context of the present invention, such a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may be any suitable nucleic acid, selected e.g. from any (double-stranded or single-stranded) DNA, preferably, without being limited thereto, e.g. genomic DNA, single-stranded DNA molecules, double-stranded DNA molecules, coding DNA, DNA primers, DNA probes, immunostimulatory DNA, a (short) DNA oligonucleotide ((short) oligodesoxyribonucleotides), or may be selected e.g. from any PNA (peptide nucleic acid) or may be selected e.g. from any (double-stranded or single-stranded) RNA, preferably, without being limited thereto, a (short) RNA oligonucleotide ((short) oligoribonucleotide), a coding RNA, a messenger RNA (mRNA), an immunostimulatory RNA, a siRNA, an antisense RNA, a micro RNA, or riboswitches, ribozymes or aptamers; etc. The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may also be a ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a transfer RNA (tRNA), a messenger RNA (mRNA), or a viral RNA (vRNA). Preferably, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is a RNA. More preferably, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may be a (linear) single-stranded RNA, even more preferably an mRNA. In the context of the present invention, an mRNA is typically an RNA, which is composed of several structural elements, e.g. an optional 5'-UTR region, an upstream positioned ribosomal binding site followed by a coding region, an optional 3'-UTR region, which may be followed by a poly-A tail (and/or a poly-C-tail). An mRNA may occur as a mono-, di-, or even multicistronic RNA, i.e. an RNA which carries the coding sequences of one, two or more proteins or peptides. Such coding sequences in di-, or even multicistronic mRNA may be separated by at least one IRES sequence, e.g. as defined herein. 
Furthermore, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may be a single- or a double-stranded nucleic acid (molecule) (which may also be regarded as a nucleic acid (molecule) due to non-covalent association of two single-stranded nucleic acid(s) (molecules)) or a partially double-stranded or partially single stranded nucleic acid, which are at least partially self complementary (both of these partially double-stranded or partially single stranded nucleic acid molecules are typically formed by a longer and a shorter single-stranded nucleic acid molecule or by two single stranded nucleic acid molecules, which are about equal in length, wherein one single-stranded nucleic acid molecule is in part complementary to the other single-stranded nucleic acid molecules molecule and both thus form a double- stranded nucleic acid molecules molecule in this region, i.e. a partially double-stranded or partially single stranded nucleic acid molecules). Preferably, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may be a single-stranded nucleic acid molecule. Furthermore, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may be a circular or linear nucleic acid molecule, preferably a linear nucleic acid molecule. 
According to one alternative, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may be a coding nucleic acid, e.g. a DNA or RNA. Such a coding DNA or RNA may be any DNA or RNA as defined above. Preferably, such a coding DNA or RNA may be a single- or a double-stranded DNA or RNA, more preferably a single-stranded DNA or RNA, and/or a circular or linear DNA or RNA, more preferably a linear DNA or RNA. Even more preferably, the coding DNA or RNA may be a (linear) single-stranded DNA or RNA. Most preferably, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may be a ((linear) single-stranded) messenger RNA (mRNA). Such an mRNA may occur as a mono-, di-, or even multicistronic RNA, i.e. an RNA which carries the coding sequences of one, two or more proteins or peptides. Such coding sequences in di-, or even multicistronic mRNA may be separated by at least one IRES sequence, e.g. as defined herein. 
The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may encode a protein or a peptide, which may be selected, without being restricted thereto, e.g. from therapeutically active proteins or peptides, from antigens, e.g. tumor antigens, pathogenic antigens (e.g. selected from pathogenic proteins as defined above or from animal antigens, viral antigens, protozoal antigens, bacterial antigens, allergic antigens), autoimmune antigens, or further antigens, from allergens, from antibodies, from immunostimulatory proteins or peptides, from antigen-specific T-cell receptors, or from any other protein or peptide suitable for a specific (therapeutic) application, wherein the coding DNA or RNA may be transported into a cell, a tissue or an organism and the protein may be expressed subsequently in this cell, tissue or organism. a) Therapeutically active proteins 
 In this context, therapeutically active proteins may be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention. These may be selected from any naturally occurring recombinant or isolated protein known to a skilled person from the prior art. Without being restricted thereto therapeutically active proteins may comprise proteins, capable of stimulating or inhibiting the signal transduction in the cell, e.g. cytokines, antibodies, etc. Therapeutically active proteins may thus comprise cytokines of class I of the family of cytokines, having 4 positionally conserved cysteine residues (CCCC) and comprising a conserved sequence motif Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser (WSXWS), wherein X is a non-conserved amino acid. Cytokines of class I of the family of cytokines comprise the GM-CSF subfamily, e.g. IL-3, IL-5, CM-CSF, the IL-6-subfamily, e.g. IL-6, IL- 1 1 , IL-12, or the IL-2-subfamily, e.g. IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, etc., or the cytokines IL- 1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-10 etc. Therapeutically active proteins may also comprise cytokines of class II of the family of cytokines, which also comprise 4 positionally conserved cystein residues (CCCC), but no conserved sequence motif Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser (WSXWS). Cytokines of class II of the family of cytokines comprise e.g. IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN- gamma, etc. Therapeutically active proteins may additionally comprise cytokines of the family of tumor necrose factors, e.g. TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, etc., or cytokines of the family of chemokines, which comprise 7 transmembrane helices and interact with G-protein, e.g. IL-8, MIP-1 , RANTES, CCR5, CXR4, etc., or cytokine specific receptors, such as TNF- Rl, TNF-RII, CD40, OX40 (CD134), Fas, etc.

 The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may alternatively encode an antigen. According to the present invention, the term "antigen" refers to a substance which is recognized by the immune system and is capable of triggering an antigen-specific immune response, e.g. by formation of antibodies as part of an adaptive immune response. In this context, the first step of an adaptive immune response is the activation of naive antigen-specific T cells by antigen-presenting cells. This occurs in the lymphoid tissues and organs through which naive T cells are constantly passing. The three cell types that can serve as antigen-presenting cells are dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Each of these cells has a distinct function in eliciting immune responses. Tissue dendritic cells take up antigens by phagocytosis and macropinocytosis and are stimulated by infection to migrate to the local lymphoid tissue, where they differentiate into mature dendritic cells. Macrophages ingest particulate antigens such as bacteria and are induced by infectious agents to express MHC class II molecules. The unique ability of B cells to bind and internalize soluble protein antigens via their receptors may be important to induce T cells. By presenting the antigen on MHC molecules leads to activation of T cells which induces their proliferation and differentiation into armed effector T cells. The most important function of effector T cells is the killing of infected cells by CD8&lt;+&gt; cytotoxic T cells and the activation of macrophages by TH1 cells which together make up cell-mediated immunity, and the activation of B cells by both TH2 and TH1 cells to produce different classes of antibody, thus driving the humoral immune response. T cells recognize an antigen by their T cell receptors which does not recognize and bind antigen directly, but instead recognize short peptide fragments e.g. of pathogens' protein antigens, which are bound to MHC molecules on the surfaces of other cells. 
T cells fall into two major classes that have different effector functions. The two classes are distinguished by the expression of the cell-surface proteins CD4 and CD8. These two types of T cells differ in the class of MHC molecule that they recognize. There are two classes of MHC molecule- MHC class I and MHC class II- which differ in their structure and expression pattern on tissues of the body. CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells bind to the MHC class II molecule and CD8&lt;+&gt; T cells to the MHC class I molecule. MHC class I and MHC class II have distinct distributions among cells that reflect the different effector functions of the T cells that recognize them. MHC class I molecules present peptides from pathogens, commonly viruses to CD8&lt;+&gt; T cells, which differentiate into cytotoxic T cells that are specialized to kill any cell that they specifically recognize. Almost all cells express MHC class I molecules, although the level of constitutive expression varies from one cell type to the next. But not only pathogenic peptides from viruses are presented by MHC class I molecules, also self-antigens like tumour antigens are presented by them. MHC class I molecules bind peptides from proteins degraded in the cytosol and transported in the endoplasmic reticulum. Thereby MHC class I molecules on the surface of cells infected with viruses or other cytosolic pathogens display peptides from these pathogen. The CD8&lt;+&gt; T cells that recognize MHC class peptide complexes are specialized to kill any cells displaying foreign peptides and so rid the body of cells infected with viruses and other cytosolic pathogens. The main function of CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells (CD4&lt;+&gt; helper T cells) that recognize MHC class II molecules is to activate other effector cells of the immune system. Thus MHC class II molecules are normally found on B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, cells that participate in immune responses, but not on other tissue cells. Macrophages, for example, are activated to kill the intravesicular pathogens they harbour, and B cells to secrete immunoglobulins against foreign molecules. MHC class II molecules are prevented from binding to peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum and thus MHC class II molecules bind peptides from proteins which are degraded in endosomes. They can capture peptides from pathogens that have entered the vesicular system of macrophages, or from antigens internalized by immature dendritic cells or the immunoglobulin receptors of B cells. Pathogens that accumulate in large numbers inside macrophage and dendritic cell vesicles tend to stimulate the differentiation of TH1 cells, whereas extracellular antigens tend to stimulate the production of TH2 cells. TH1 cells activate the microbicidal properties of macrophages and induce B cells to make IgG antibodies that are very effective of opsonising extracellular pathogens for ingestion by phagocytic cells, whereas TH2 cells initiate the humoral response by activating naive B cells to secrete IgM, and induce the production of weakly opsonising antibodes such as lgG1 and lgG3 (mouse) and lgG2 and lgG4 (human) as well as IgA and IgE (mouse and human). 
In the context of the present invention, antigens as encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention typically comprise any antigen, falling under the above definition, more preferably protein and peptide antigens, e.g. tumor antigens, allergy antigens, auto-immune self-antigens, pathogens, etc. In accordance with the invention, antigens as encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may be antigens generated outside the cell, more typically antigens not derived from the host organism (e.g. a human) itself (i.e. non-self antigens) but rather derived from host cells outside the host organism, e.g. viral antigens, bacterial antigens, fungal antigens, protozoological antigens, animal antigens (preferably selected from animals or organisms as disclosed herein), allergy antigens, etc. Allergy antigens are typically antigens, which cause an allergy in a human and may be derived from either a human or other sources. Antigens as encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may be furthermore antigens generated inside the cell, the tissue or the body, e.g. by secretion of proteins, their degradation, metabolism, etc. Such antigens include antigens derived from the host organism (e.g. a human) itself, e.g. tumor antigens, self-antigens or auto-antigens, such as auto-immune self-antigens, etc., but also (non-self) antigens as defined above, which have been originally been derived from host cells outside the host organism, but which are fragmented or degraded inside the body, tissue or cell, e.g. by (protease) degradation, metabolism, etc. One class of antigens as encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention comprises tumor antigens. "Tumor antigens" are preferably located on the surface of the (tumor) cell. Tumor antigens may also be selected from proteins, which are overexpressed in tumor cells compared to a normal cell. Furthermore, tumor antigens also includes antigens expressed in cells which are (were) not themselves (or originally not themselves) degenerate but are associated with the supposed tumor. Antigens which are connected with tumor-supplying vessels or (re)formation thereof, in particular those antigens which are associated with neovascularization, e.g. growth factors, such as VEGF, bFGF etc., are also included herein. Antigens connected with a tumor furthermore include antigens from cells or tissues, typically embedding the tumor. Further, some substances (usually proteins or peptides) are expressed in patients suffering (knowingly or not-knowingly) from a cancer disease and they occur in increased concentrations in the body fluids of said patients. These substances are also referred to as "tumor antigens", however they are not antigens in the stringent meaning of an immune response inducing substance. The class of tumor antigens can be divided further into tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) and tumor-associated-antigens (TAAs). TSAs can only be presented by tumor cells and never by normal "healthy" cells. They typically result from a tumor specific mutation. TAAs, which are more common, are usually presented by both tumor and healthy cells. These antigens are recognized and the antigen-presenting cell can be destroyed by cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, tumor antigens can also occur on the surface of the tumor in the form of, e.g., a mutated receptor. In this case, they can be recognized by antibodies. 
Examples of tumor antigens as encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below. These tables illustrate specific (protein) antigens (i.e. "tumor antigens") with respect to the cancer disease, they are associated with. According to the invention, the terms "cancer diseases" and "tumor diseases" are used synonymously herein.

 More preferably, in the latter embodiment, the at least one antigen(s) according to b) is (are) selected from the following combination: 
 - Survivin and 5T4 
In the above embodiments, each of the at least two (preferably different) antigens as defined herein may be encoded by one (monocistronic) RNA, preferably one (monocistronic) mRNA. In other words, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention may comprise at least two (monocistronic) RNAs, preferably mRNAs, wherein each of these at least two (monocistronic) RNAs, preferably mRNAs, may encode just one (preferably different) antigen, preferably selected from one of the above mentioned combinations. 
According to another particularly preferred embodiment, the lyophi lized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention may comprise (at least) one bi- or even multicistronic RNA, preferably mRNA, i.e. (at least) one RNA which carries two or even more of the coding sequences of at the least two (preferably different) antigens, preferably selected from one of the above mentioned combinations. Such coding sequences of the at least two (preferably different) antigens of the (at least) one bi- or even multicistronic RNA may be separated by at least one IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) sequence, as defined below. Thus, the term "encoding at least two (preferably different) antigens" may mean, without being limited thereto, that the (at least) one (bi- or even multicistronic) RNA, preferably a mRNA, may encode e.g. at least two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven or twelve (preferably different) antigens of the above mentioned group(s) of antigens or their fragments or variants. More preferably, without being limited thereto, the (at least) one (bi- or even multicistronic) RNA, preferably mRNA, may encode e.g. at least two, three, four, five or six (preferably different) antigens of the above mentioned subgroup(s) of antigens or their fragments or variants within the above definitions. In this context, a so-called IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) sequence as defined above can function as a sole ribosome binding site, but it can also serve to provide a bi- or even multicistronic RNA as defined above which codes for several proteins, which are to be translated by the ribosomes independently of one another. Examples of IRES sequences which can be used according to the invention are those from picornaviruses (e.g. FMDV), pestiviruses (CFFV), polioviruses (PV), encephalomyocarditis viruses (ECMV), foot and mouth disease viruses (FMDV), hepatitis C viruses (HCV), classical swine fever viruses (CSFV), mouse leukoma virus (MLV), simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) or cricket paralysis viruses (CrPV). 
According to a further particularly preferred embodiment, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention may comprise a mixture of at least one monocistronic RNA, preferably mRNA, as defined above, and at least one bi- or even multicistronic RNA, preferably mRNA, as defined above. The at least one monocistronic RNA and/or the at least one bi- or even multicistronic RNA preferably encode different antigens or their fragments or variants, the antigens preferably being selected from one of the above mentioned groups or subgroups of antigens, more preferably in one of the above mentioned combinations. However, the at least one monocistronic RNA and the at least one bi- or even multicistronic RNA may preferably also encode (in part) identical antigens selected from one of the above mentioned groups or subgroups of antigens, preferably in one of the above mentioned combinations, provided that the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention as a whole provides at least two (preferably different) antigens as defined above. Such an embodiment may be advantageous e.g. for a staggered, e.g. time dependent, administration of e.g. a vaccine, a pharmaceutical composition or a kit of the present invention to a patient in need thereof. The components of such a vaccine, a pharmaceutical composition or a kit of the present invention, particularly the different RNAs encoding the at least two (preferably different) antigens, may be e.g. contained in (different parts of) a kit of parts composition or may be e.g. administered separately as components of different embodiments according to the present invention. 
According to another embodiment, one further class of antigens as encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention comprises allergy antigens. Such allergy antigens may be selected from antigens derived from different sources, e.g. from animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, etc. Allergens in this context include e.g. grasses, pollens, molds, drugs, or numerous environmental triggers, etc. Allergy antigens typically belong to different classes of compounds, such as nucleic acids and their fragments, proteins or peptides and their fragments, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, sugars, lipids, phospholipids, etc. Of particular interest in the context of the present invention are antigens, which may be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention, i.e. protein or peptide antigens and their fragments or epitopes, or nucleic acids and their fragments, particularly nucleic acids and their fragments, encoding such protein or peptide antigens and their fragments or epitopes. 
Particularly preferred, antigens derived from animals, which may be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention, may include antigens derived from, without being limited thereto, insects, such as mite (e.g. house dust mites), mosquito, bee (e.g. honey bee, bumble bee), cockroache, tick, moth (e.g. silk moth), midge, bug, flea, wasp, caterpillar, fruit fly, migratory locust, grasshopper, ant aphide, from crustaceans, such as shrimps, crab, krill, lobster, prawn, crawfish, scampi, from birds, such as duck, goose, seagull, turkey, ostrich, chicken, from fishes, such as eel, herring, carp, seabream, codfish, halibut, catfish, beluga, salmon, flounder, mackerel, cuttlefish, perch, form molluscs, such as scallop, octopus, abalone, snail, whelk, squid, clam, mussel, from spiders, from mammals, such as cow, rabbit, sheep, lion, jaguar, leopard, rat, pig, buffalo, dog, loris, hamster, guinea pig, fallow deer, horse, cat, mouse, ocelot, serval, from arthropod, such as spider, or sil erfish, from worms, such as nematodes, from trichinella species, or roundworm, from amphibians, such as frogs, or from sea squirt, etc. 
Antigens derived from plants, which may be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention, may include antigens derived from, without being limited thereto, fruits, such as kiwi, pineapple, jackfruit,papaya, lemon, orange, mandarin, melon, sharon fruit, strawberry, lychee, apple, cherry paradise apple, mango, passion fruit, plum, apricot, nectarine, pear, passion fruit, raspberry, grape, from vegetables, such as garlic, onion, leek, soya bean, celery, cauliflower, turnip, paprika, chickpea, fennel, zucchini, cucumber, carrot, yam, bean, pea, olive, tomato, potato, lentil, lettuce, avocado, parsley, horseradish, chirimoya, beet, pumkin, spinach, from spices, such as mustard, coriander, saffron, pepper, aniseed, from crop, such as oat, buckwheat, barley, rice, wheat, maize, rapeseed, sesame, from nuts, such as cashew, walnut, butternut, pistachio, almond, hazelnut, peanut, brazil nut, pecan, chestnut, from trees, such as alder, hornbeam, cedar, birch, hazel, beech, ash, privet, oak, plane tree, cypress, palm, from flowers, such as ragweed, carnation, forsythia, sunflower, lupine, chamomile, lilac, passion flower, from grasses, such as quack grass, common bent, brome grass, Bermuda grass, sweet vernal grass, rye grass, or from other plants, such as opium poppy, pellitory, ribwort, tobacco, asparagus, mugwort, cress, etc. Antigens derived from fungi, which may be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention, may include antigens derived from, without being limited thereto, e.g. Alternia sp., Aspergillus sp., Beauveria sp., Candida sp., Cladosporium sp., Endothia sp., Curcularia sp., Embellisia sp., Epicoccum sp., Fusarium sp., Malassezia sp., Penicillum sp., Pleospora sp., Saccharomyces sp., etc. 
Antigens derived from bacteria, which may be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention, may include antigens derived from, without being limited thereto, e.g. Bacillus tetani, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces griseus, etc.. Antibodies 
According to a further alternative, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may encode an antibody. According to the present invention, such an antibody may be selected from any antibody, e.g. any recombinantly produced or naturally occurring antibodies, known in the art, in particular antibodies suitable for therapeutic, diagnostic or scientific purposes, or antibodies which have been identified in relation to specific cancer diseases. Herein, the term "antibody" is used in its broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (including agonist, antagonist, and blocking or neutralizing antibodies) and antibody species with polyepitopic specificity. According to the invention, "antibody" typically comprises any antibody known in the art (e.g. IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE antibodies), such as naturally occurring antibodies, antibodies generated by immunization in a host organism, antibodies which were isolated and identified from naturally occurring antibodies or antibodies generated by immunization in a host organism and recombinantly produced by biomolecular methods known in the art, as well as chimeric antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, bispecific antibodies, intrabodies, i.e. antibodies expressed in cells and optionally localized in specific cell compartments, and fragments and variants of the aforementioned antibodies. In general, an antibody consists of a light chain and a heavy chain both having variable and constant domains. The light chain consists of an N-terminal variable domain, VL, and a C-terminal constant domain, Q. In contrast, the heavy chain of the IgG antibody, for example, is comprised of an N-terminal variable domain, VH, and three constant domains, CH1 , CH2 und CH3. Single chain antibodies may be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention as well. According to a first alternative, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may encode a polyclonal antibody. In this context, the term, "polyclonal antibody" typically means mixtures of antibodies directed to specific antigens or immunogens or epitopes of a protein which were generated by immunization of a host organism, such as a mammal, e.g. including goat, cattle, swine, dog, cat, donkey, monkey, ape, a rodent such as a mouse, hamster and rabbit. Polyclonal antibodies are generally not identical, and thus usually recognize different epitopes or regions from the same antigen. Thus, in such a case, typically a mixture (a composition) of different lyophilized nucleic acids according to the present invention will be used, each lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) encoding a specific (monoclonal) antibody being directed to specific antigens or immunogens or epitopes of a protein. 
According to a further alternative, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may encode a monoclonal antibody. The term "monoclonal antibody" herein typically refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally-occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed to a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed to different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed to a single determinant on the antigen. For example, monoclonal antibodies as defined above may be made by the hybridoma method first described by <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975)</bibl>, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods, e.g. as described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Pat. No. 4,81 6,567</bibl>. "Monoclonal antibodies" may also be isolated from phage libraries generated using the techniques described in <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">McCafferty et al., Nature, 348:552-554 (1990)</bibl>, for example. According to Kohler and Milstein, an immunogen (antigen) of interest is injected into a host such as a mouse and B-cell lymphocytes produced in response to the immunogen are harvested after a period of time. The B-cells are combined with myeloma cells obtained from mouse and introduced into a medium which permits the B-cells to fuse with the myeloma cells, producing hybridomas. These fused cells (hybridomas) are then placed into separate wells of microtiter plates and grown to produce monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies are tested to determine which of them are suitable for detecting the antigen of interest. After being selected, the monoclonal antibodies can be grown in cell cultures or by injecting the hybridomas into mice. However, for the purposes of the present invention, the peptide sequences of these monoclonal antibodies have to be sequenced and the nucleic acid sequences encoding these antibodies can be present as the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention. 
For therapeutical purposes in humans, non-human monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, such as murine antibodies may also be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention. However, such antibodies are typically only of limited use, since they generally induce an immune response by production of human antibodies directed to the said non-human antibodies, in the human body. Therefore, a particular non-human antibody can only be administered once to the human. To solve this problem, chimeric, humanized non-human and human antibodies are also envisaged encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention. "Chimeric" antibodies, which may be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention, are preferably antibodies in which the constant domains of an antibody described above are replaced by sequences of antibodies from other organisms, preferably human sequences. "Humanized" (non- human) antibodies, which may be also encoded by lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention, are antibodies in which the constant and variable domains (except for the hypervariable domains) described above of an antibody are replaced by human sequences. According to another alternative, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may encode human antibodies, i.e. antibodies having only human sequences. Such human antibodies can be isolated from human tissues or from immunized non-human host organisms which are transgene for the human IgG gene locus, and nucleic acid sequences may be prepared according to procedures well known in the art. Additionally, human antibodies can be provided by the use of a phage display. 
In addition, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may encode bispecific antibodies. "Bispecific" antibodies in context of the invention are preferably antibodies which act as an adaptor between an effector and a respective target by two different F^-domains, e.g. for the purposes of recruiting effector molecules such as toxins, drugs, cytokines etc., targeting effector cells such as CTL, NK cells, makrophages, granulocytes, etc. (see for review: <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kontermann R.E., Acta Pharmacol. Sin, 2005, 26(1 ): 1 -9</bibl>). Bispecific antibodies as described herein are, in general, configured to recognize by two different F^-domains, e.g. two different antigens, immunogens, epitopes, drugs, cells (or receptors on cells), or other molecules (or structures) as described above. Bispecificity means herewith that the antigen-binding regions of the antibodies are specific for two different epitopes. Thus, different antigens, immunogens or epitopes, etc. can be brought close together, what, optionally, allows a direct interaction of the two components. For example, different cells such as effector cells and target cells can be connected via a bispecific antibody. Encompassed, but not limited, by the present invention are antibodies or fragments thereof which bind, on the one hand, a soluble antigen as described herein, and, on the other hand, an antigen or receptor on the surface of a tumor cell. 
According to the invention, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may also encode intrabodies, wherein these intrabodies may be antibodies as defined above. Since these antibodies are intracellular expressed antibodies, i.e. antibodies which may be encoded by nucleic acids localized in specific areas of the cell and also expressed there, such antibodies may be termed intrabodies. 
Antibodies as encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may preferably comprise full-length antibodies, i.e. antibodies composed of the full heavy and full light chains, as described above. However, derivatives of antibodies such as antibody fragments, variants or adducts may also be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention. 
The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may also encode antibody fragments selected from Fab, Fab', F(ab')2/ Fc, Facb, pFc', Fd and Fv fragments of the aforementioned (full-length) antibodies. In general, antibody fragments are known in the art. For example, a Fab ("fragment, antigen binding") fragment is composed of one constant and one variable domain of each of the heavy and the light chain. The two variable domains bind the epitope on specific antigens. The two chains are connected via a disulfide linkage. A scFv ("single chain variable fragment") fragment, for example, typically consists of the variable domains of the light and heavy chains. The domains are linked by an artificial linkage, in general a polypeptide linkage such as a peptide composed of 1 5-25 glycine, proline and/or serine residues. 
According to a further alternative, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may be in the form of dsRNA, preferably si RNA. A dsRNA, or a si RNA, is of interest particularly in connection with the phenomenon of RNA interference. The in vitro technique of RNA interference (RNAi) is based on double-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNA), which trigger the sequence-specific suppression of gene expression (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Zamore (2001 ) Nat. Struct. Biol. 9: 746-750</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sharp (2001 ) Genes Dev. 5:485-490</bibl>: <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hannon (2002) Nature 41 : 244-251</bibl> ). In the transfection of mammalian cells with long dsRNA, the activation of protein kinase R and RnaseL brings about unspecific effects, such as, for example, an interferon response (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Stark et a/. (1 998) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 67: 227-264</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">He and Katze (2002) Viral Immunol. 1 5: 95-1 19</bibl>). These unspecific effects are avoided when shorter, for example 21 - to 23-mer, so-called siRNA (small interfering RNA), is used, because unspecific effects are not triggered by siRNA that is shorter than 30 bp (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Elbashir et al. (2001 ) Nature 41 1 : 494-498</bibl>). The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may thus be a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) having a length of from 1 7 to 29, preferably from 1 9 to 25, and preferably being at least 90%, more preferably 95% and especially 1 00% (of the nucleotides of a dsRNA) complementary to a section of the nucleic acid sequence of a (therapeutically relevant) protein or antigen described (as active ingredient) hereinbefore, either a coding or a non-coding section, preferably a coding section. 90% complementary means that with a length of a dsRNA described herein of, for example, 20 nucleotides, this contains not more than 2 nucleotides without corresponding complementarity with the corresponding section of the mRNA. The sequence of the double-stranded RNA used according to the invention is, however, preferably wholly complementary in its general structure with a section of the nucleic acid of a therapeutically relevant protein or antigen described hereinbefore. In this context the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may be a dsRNA having the general structure 5'-(N1 7.29)-3 ', preferably having the general structure 5'-(N, 9_25)-3 ', more preferably having the general structure 5'-([Nu],9.24)-3', or yet more preferably having the general structure 5'-(N2,_23)-3', wherein for each general structure each N is a (preferably different) nucleotide of a section of the mRNA of a therapeutically relevant protein or antigen described hereinbefore, preferably being selected from a continuous number of 1 7 to 29 nucleotides of the mRNA of a therapeutically relevant protein or antigen and being present in the general structure 5'-(N17.29)-3' in their natural order. In principle, all the sections having a length of from 1 7 to 29, preferably from 19 to 25, base pairs that occur in the mRNA can serve as target sequence for a dsRNA herein. Equally, dsRNAs used as lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention can also be directed against nucleotide sequences of a (therapeutically relevant) protein or antigen described (as active ingredient) hereinbefore that do not lie in the coding region, in particular in the 5' non-coding region of the mRNA, for example, therefore, against non-coding regions of the mRNA having a regulatory function. The target sequence of the dsRNA used as lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention can therefore lie in the translated and untranslated region of the mRNA and/or in the region of the control elements of a protein or antigen described hereinbefore. The target sequence of a dsRNA used as lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention can also lie in the overlapping region of untranslated and translated sequence; in particular, the target sequence can comprise at least one nucleotide upstream of the start triplet of the coding region of the mRNA. 
According to another alternative, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may be in the form of a CpG nucleic acid, in particular CpG-RNA or CpG-DNA. A CpG-RNA or CpG-DNA used according to the invention can be a single- stranded CpG-DNA (ss CpG-DNA), a double-stranded CpG-DNA (dsDNA), a single- stranded CpG-RNA (ss CpG-RNA) or a double-stranded CpG-RNA (ds CpG-RNA). The CpG nucleic acid used according to the invention is preferably in the form of CpG-RNA, more preferably in the form of single-stranded CpG-RNA (ss CpG-RNA). Also preferably, such CpG nucleic acids have a length as described above. Preferably, the CpG motifs are unmethylated. 
Likewise, according to a further alternative, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may be in the form of an immunostimulatory RNA. The immunostimulatory RNA of the complexed RNA of the present invention may be any (double-stranded or single-stranded) RNA, e.g. a coding RNA, as defined above. Preferably, the immunostimulatory RNA may be a single-stranded, a double-stranded or a partially double-stranded RNA, more preferably a single-stranded RNA, and/or a circular or linear RNA, more preferably a linear RNA. More preferably, the immunostimulatory RNA may be a (linear) single-stranded RNA. Even more preferably, the immunostimulatory RNA may be a ((linear) single-stranded) messenger RNA (mRNA). An immunostimulatory RNA may also occur as a short RNA oligonucleotide as defined above. An immunostimulatory RNA as used herein may furthermore be selected from any class of RNA molecules, found in nature or being prepared synthetically, and which can induce an immune response. In this context, an immune response may occur in various ways. A substantial factor for a suitable immune response is the stimulation of different T-cell sub-populations. T-lymphocytes are typically divided into two sub-populations, the T-helper 1 (Thi ) cells and the T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, with which the immune system is capable of destroying intracellular (Th1 ) and extracellular (Th2) pathogens (e.g. antigens). The two Th cell populations differ in the pattern of the effector proteins (cytokines) produced by them. Thus, Th1 cells assist the cellular immune response by activation of macrophages and cytotoxic T-cells. Th2 cells, on the other hand, promote the humoral immune response by stimulation of the B-cells for conversion into plasma cells and by formation of antibodies (e.g. against antigens). The Th1/Th2 ratio is therefore of great importance in the immune response. In connection with the present invention, the Th1/Th2 ratio of the immune response is preferably shifted in the direction towards the cellular response (Th1 response) and a cellular immune response is thereby induced. According to one example, the immune system may be activated by ligands of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are a family of highly conserved pattern recognition receptor (PRR) polypeptides that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and play a critical role in innate immunity in mammals. Currently at least thirteen family members, designated TLR1 - TLR13 (Toll-like receptors: TLR1 , TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR1 1 , TLR12 or TLR13), have been identified. Furthermore, a number of specific TLR ligands have been identified. It was e.g. found that unmethylated bacterial DNA and synthetic analogs thereof (CpG DNA) are ligands for TLR9 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hemmi H et al. (2000) Nature 408:740-5</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bauer S et al. (2001 ) Proc NatlAcadSci USA 98, 9237-42</bibl>). Furthermore, it has been reported that ligands for certain TLRs include certain nucleic acid molecules and that certain types of RNA are immunostimulatory in a sequence-independent or sequence-dependent manner, wherein these various immunostimulatory RNAs may e.g. stimulate TLR3, TLR7, or TLR8, or intracellular receptors such as RIG-I, MDA-5, etc. E.g. Lipford et a/, determined certain G,U-containing oligoribonucleotides as immunostimulatory by acting via TLR7 and TLR8 (see <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 03/086280</bibl>). The immunostimulatory G,U-containing oligoribonucleotides described by Lipford et a/, were believed to be derivable from RNA sources including ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, messenger RNA, and viral RNA. 
According to the present invention, it was found that any RNA (molecule) as e.g. defined above (irrespective of its specific length, strandedness, modification and/or nucleotide sequence) may have immunostimulatory properties, i.e. enhance the immune response. RNA as defined above and being the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may thus be used to enhance (unspecific) immunostimulation, if suitable and desired for a specific treatment. The at least one (immunostimulatory) RNA (molecule) used as the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may thus comprise any RNA sequence known to be immunostimulatory, including, without being limited thereto, RNA sequences representing and/or encoding ligands of TLRs, preferably selected from family members TLR1 - TLR13, more preferably from TLR7 and TLR8, ligands for intracellular receptors for RNA (such as RIG-I or MAD-5, etc.) (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Meylan, E., Tschopp, J. (2006). Toll-like receptors and RNA helicases: two parallel ways to trigger antiviral responses. Mol. Cell 22, 561 -569</bibl>), or any other immunostimulatory RNA sequence. Furthermore, (classes of) immunostimulatory RNA molecules, used as the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention, may include any other RNA capable of eliciting an immune response. Without being limited thereto, such immunostimulatory RNA may include ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and viral RNA (vRNA). 
Such further (classes of) immunostimulatory RNA molecules, which may be used as the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention, without being limited thereto, may comprise e.g. an RNA molecule of formula (I): 
G¦XmGn wherein: 
 G is guanosine, uracil or an analogue of guanosine or uracil; 
 X is guanosine, uracil, adenosine, thymidine, cytosine or an analogue of the above- mentioned nucleotides; 
I is an integer from 1 to 40, 
 wherein when I = 1 G is guanosine or an analogue thereof, 
 when I &gt; 1 at least 50% of the nucleotides are guanosine or an analogue thereof; 
m is an integer and is at least 3; 
 wherein when m = 3 X is uracil or an analogue thereof, 
 when m &gt; 3 at least 3 successive uracils or analogues of uracil occur; 
n is an integer from 1 to 40, 
 wherein when n = 1 G is guanosine or an analogue thereof, 
 when n &gt; 1 at least 50% of the nucleotides are guanosine or an analogue thereof. 
In addition, such further (classes of) immunostimulatory RNA molecules, which may be used as the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may comprise, without being limited thereto, e.g. an RNA molecule of formula (II): 
QXmCn wherein: 
 C is cytosine, uracil or an analogue of cytosine or uracil; 
 X is guanosine, uracil, adenosine, thymidine, cytosine or an analogue of the above- mentioned nucleotides; 
I is an integer from 1 to 40, 
 wherein when I = 1 C is cytosine or an analogue thereof, 
 when I &gt; 1 at least 50% of the nucleotides are cytosine or an analogue thereof; 
m is an integer and is at least 3; 
 wherein when m = 3 X is uracil or an analogue thereof, when m &gt; 3 at least 3 successive uracils or analogues of uracil occur; 
n is an integer from 1 to 40, 
 wherein when n = 1 C is cytosine or an analogue thereof, 
 when n &gt; 1 at least 50% of the nucleotides are cytosine or an analogue thereof. 
Preferably, the immunostimulatory RNA molecules used as the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention comprise a length as defined above in general for RNA molecules of the RNA of the present invention, more preferably a length of 5 to 5000, of 500 to 5000 or, more preferably, of 1000 to 5000 or, alternatively, of 5 to 1000, 5 to 500, 5 to 250, of 5 to 100, of 5 to 50 or, more preferably, of 5 to 30 nucleotides. 
The immunostimulatory RNA used as the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention may be furthermore modified, preferably "chemically modified" in order to enhance the immunostimulatory properties of said DNA. The term "chemical modification" means that the immuostimulatory RNA is modified by replacement, insertion or removal of individual or several atoms or atomic groups compared with naturally occurring RNA species. Preferably, the chemical modification of the immunostimulatory RNA comprises at least one analogue of naturally occurring nucleotides. In a list which is in no way conclusive, examples which may be mentioned for nucleotide analogues and which may be used herein for modification are analogues of guanosine, uracil, adenosine, thymidine, cytosine.

The preparation of such analogues is known to a person skilled in the art, for example from <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US Patents 4,373,071</bibl> , <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,401 ,796</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,41 5,732</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,458,066</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,500,707</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,668,777</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 4,973,679</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 5,047,524</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 5,1 32,41 8</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 5,1 53,31 9</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">US 5,262,530 and 5,700,642</bibl>. In the case of an analogue as described above, particular preference is given according to the invention to those analogues that increase the immunogenicity of the immunostimulatory RNA sequence used as the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention and/or do not interfere with a further modification that has been introduced into said immunostimulatory RNA. 
In general, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention as defined above may also occur in the form of a modified nucleic acid, wherein any modification, as defined herein, may be introduced into the nucleic acid prior to lyophilization. Modifications as defined herein preferably lead to a further stabilized lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention. According to a first embodiment, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention as defined above may thus be provided as a "stabi lized nucleic acid", preferably as a stabilized RNA, more preferably as an RNA that is essentially resistant to in vivo degradation (e.g. by an exo- or endo-nuclease). Such stabilization can be effected, for example, by a modified phosphate backbone of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention. A backbone modification in connection with the present invention is a modification in which phosphates of the backbone of the nucleotides contained in the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) are chemically modified. Nucleotides that may be preferably used in this connection contain e.g. a phosphorothioate-modified phosphate backbone, preferably at least one of the phosphate oxygens contained in the phosphate backbone being replaced by a sulfur atom. Stabilized lyophilized nucleic acids may further include, for example: non-ionic phosphate analogues, such as, for example, alkyl and aryl phosphonates, in which the charged phosphonate oxygen is replaced by an alkyl or aryl group, or phosphodiesters and alkylphosphotriesters, in which the charged oxygen residue is present in alkylated form. Such backbone modifications typically include, without implying any limitation, modifications from the group consisting of methylphosphonates, phosphoramidates and phosphorothioates (e.g. cytidine-5'-0-(1 - thiophosphate)). 
The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention may additionally or alternatively also contain sugar modifications. A sugar modification in connection with the present invention is a chemical modification of the sugar of the nucleotides of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) and typically includes, without implying any limitation, sugar modifications selected from the group consisting of 2 '-deoxy-2 '-fluoro- oligoribonucleotide (2 '-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate, 2'-fluoro-2 '-deoxyuridine- 5 '-triphosphate), 2 '-deoxy-2 '-deamine oligoribonucleotide (2 '-amino-2 '-deoxycytidine-5'- triphosphate, 2'-amino-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate), 2 '-0-alkyl oligoribonucleotide, 2'- deoxy-2 '-C-alkyl oligoribonucleotide (2 '-O-methylcytidine-5 '-triphosphate, 2 '- methyluridine-5'-triphosphate), 2 '-C-alkyl oligoribonucleotide, and isomers thereof (2 '- aracytidine-5'-triphosphate, 2 '-arauridine-5'-triphosphate), or azidotriphosphate (2 '-azido- 2 '-deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate, 2'-azido-2 '-deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate). The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention may additionally or alternatively also contain at least one base modification, which is preferably suitable for increasing the expression of the protein coded for by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as compared with the unaltered, i.e. natural (= native), nucleic acid sequence. Significant in this case means an increase in the expression of the protein compared with the expression of the native nucleic acid sequence by at least 20%, preferably at least 30%, 40%, 50% or 60%, more preferably by at least 70%, 80%, 90% or even 100% and most preferably by at least 150%, 200% or even 300% or more. In connection with the present invention, a nucleotide having such a base modification is preferably selected from the group of the base-modified nucleotides consisting of 2-amino-6-chloropurineriboside-5'- triphosphate, 2-aminoadenosine-5 '-triphosphate, 2-thiocytidine-5 '-triphosphate, 2- thiouridine-5'-triphosphate, 4-thiouridine-5'-triphosphate, 5-aminoallylcytidine-5'- triphosphate, 5-aminoallyluridine-5'-triphosphate, 5-bromocytidine-5'-triphosphate, 5- bromouridine-5'-triphosphate, 5-iodocytidine-5 '-triphosphate, 5-iodouridine-5'- triphosphate, 5-methylcytidine-5'-triphosphate, 5-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate, 6- azacytidine-5 '-triphosphate, 6-azauridine-5 '-triphosphate, 6-chloropurineriboside-5'- triphosphate, 7-deazaadenosine-5'-triphosphate, 7-deazaguanosine-5'-triphosphate, 8- azaadenosine-5'-triphosphate, 8-azidoadenosine-5'-triphosphate, benzimidazole-riboside- 5 '-triphosphate, N1 -methyladenosine-5'-triphosphate, Nl -methylguanosine-5'-triphosphate, N6-methyladenosine-5'-triphosphate, 06-methylguanosine-5 '-triphosphate, pseudouridine- 5 '-triphosphate, or puromycin-5 '-triphosphate, xanthosine-5'-triphosphate. Particular preference is given to nucleotides for base modifications selected from the group of base- modified nucleotides consisting of 5-methylcytidine-5'-triphosphate, 7-deazaguanosine-5'- triphosphate, 5-bromocytidine-5 '-triphosphate, and pseudouridine-5 '-triphosphate. 
According to another embodiment, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention can likewise be modified (and preferably stabilized) by introducing further modified nucleotides containing modifications of their ribose or base moieties. Generally, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention may contain any native (= naturally occurring) nucleotide, e.g. guanosine, uracil, adenosine, and/or cytosine or an analogue thereof. In this connection, nucleotide analogues are defined as non-natively occurring variants of naturally occurring nucleotides. Accordingly, analogues are chemically derivatized nucleotides with non-natively occurring functional groups, which are preferably added to or deleted from the naturally occurring nucleotide or which substitute the naturally occurring functional groups of a nucleotide. Accordingly, each component of the naturally occurring nucleotide may be modified, namely the base component, the sugar (ribose) component and/or the phosphate component forming the backbone (see above) of the nucleic acid sequence. Exemplary analogues of guanosine, uracil, adenosine, and cytosine include, without implying any limitation, any naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring guanosine, uracil, adenosine, thymidine or cytosine that has been altered chemically, for example by acetylation, methylation, hydroxylation, etc., including 1 -methyl-adenosine, 1 -methyl- guanosine, 1 -methyl-inosine, 2,2-dimethyl-guanosine, 2,6-diaminopurine, 2'-Amino-2'- deoxyadenosine, 2'-Amino-2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-Amino-2'-deoxyguanosine, 2'-Amino-2'- deoxyuridine, 2-Amino-6-chloropurineriboside, 2-Aminopurine-riboside, 2'-Araadenosine, 2'- Aracytidine, 2'-Arauridine, 2 '-Azido-2 '-deoxyadenosine, 2 '-Azido-2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-Azido- 2'-deoxyguanosine, 2'-Azido-2'-deoxyuridine, 2-Chloroadenosine, 2'-Fluoro-2'- deoxyadenosine, 2'-Fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-Fluoro-2'-deoxyguanosine, 2'-Fluoro-2'- deoxyuridine, 2'-Fluorothymidine, 2-methyl-adenosine, 2-methyl-guanosine, 2-methyl-thio- N6-isopenenyl-adenosine, 2 '-O-Methyl-2 -aminoadenosine, 2 '-O-Methyl-2 '-deoxyadenosine, 2'-0-Methyl-2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-0-Methyl-2'-deoxyguanosine, 2 '-O-Methyl-2 '-deoxyuridine, 2'-0-Methyl-5-methyluridine, 2'-O-Methylinosine, 2'-O-Methylpseudouridine, 2-Thiocytidine, 2-thio-cytosine, 3-methyl-cytosine, 4-acetyl-cytosine, 4-Thiouridine, 5- (carboxyhydroxymethyl)-uracil, 5,6-Dihydrouridine, 5-Aminoallylcytidine, 5-Aminoallyl- deoxy-uridine, 5-Bromouridine, 5-carboxymehtylaminomethyl-2-thio-uracil, 5- carboxymethylamonomethyl-uracil, 5-Chloro-Ara-cytosine, 5-Fluoro-uridine, 5-lodouridine, 5- methoxycarbonylmethyl-uridine, 5-methoxy-uridine, 5-methyl-2-thio-uridine, 6-Azacytidine, 6-Azauridine, 6-Chloro-7-deaza-guanosine, 6-Chloropurineriboside, 6-Mercapto-guanosine, 6- Methyl-mercaptopurine-riboside, 7-Deaza-2'-deoxy-guanosine, 7-Deazaadenosine, 7-methyl- guanosine, 8-Azaadenosine, 8-Bromo-adenosine, 8-Bromo-guanosine, 8-Mercapto-guanosine, 8-Oxoguanosine, Benzimidazole-riboside, Beta-D-mannosyl-queosine, Dihydro-uracil, Inosine, N1 -Methyladenosine, N6-([6-Aminohexyl]carbamoylmethyl)-adenosine, N6- isopentenyl-adenosine, N6-methyl-adenosine, N7-Methyl-xanthosine, N-uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methyl ester, Puromycin, Queosine, Uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, Uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methyl ester, Wybutoxosine, Xanthosine, and Xylo-adenosine.

In the case of an analogue as described above, particular preference may be given according to the invention to those analogues that do not interfere with a further modification of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) that has been introduced. 
According to a particular embodiment, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention can contain a lipid modification. Such a lipid-modified lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) typically comprises a nucleic acid as defined herein. Such a lipid- modified lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) typically further comprises at least one linker covalently linked with that nucleic acid, and at least one lipid covalently linked with the respective linker.

The lipid contained in the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention (complexed or covalently bound thereto) is typically a lipid or a lipophilic residue that preferably is itself biologically active. Such lipids preferably include natural substances or compounds such as, for example, vitamins, e.g. alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), including RRR-alpha-tocopherol (formerly D-alpha-tocopherol), L-alpha-tocopherol, the racemate D,L-alpha-tocopherol, vitamin E succinate (VES), or vitamin A and its derivatives, e.g. retinoic acid, retinol, vitamin D and its derivatives, e.g. vitamin D and also the ergosterol precursors thereof, vitamin E and its derivatives, vitamin K and its derivatives, e.g. vitamin K and related quinone or phytol compounds, or steroids, such as bile acids, for example cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, dehydrocholic acid, cortisone, digoxygenin, testosterone, cholesterol or thiocholesterol. Further lipids or lipophilic residues within the scope of the present invention include, without implying any limitation, polyalkylene glycols (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Oberhauser et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1992, 20, 533</bibl>), aliphatic groups such as, for example, C1 -C20-alkanes, C1 -C20-alkenes or C1 -C20-aikanol compounds, etc., such as, for example, dodecanediol, hexadecanol or undecyl residues (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Saison-Behmoaras et al., EMBO J, 1991 , 10, 1 1 1</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kabanov et al., FEBS Lett., 1990, 259, 327</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Svinarchuk et al., Biochimie, 1993, 75, 49</bibl>), phospholipids such as, for example, phosphatidylglycerol, diacylphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, di- hexadecyl-rac-glycerol, sphingolipids, cerebrosides, gangliosides, or triethylammonium 1 ,2- di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 3651</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Shea et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1990, 18, 3777</bibl>), polyamines or polyalkylene glycols, such as, for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG) (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Manoharan et al., Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, 1995, 14, 969</bibl>), hexaethylene glycol (HEG), palmitin or palmityl residues (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mishra et al., Biochim.

Ther., 1996, 277, 923</bibl>), and also waxes, terpenes, alicyclic hydrocarbons, saturated and mono- or poly-unsaturated fatty acid residues, etc. The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention may likewise be stabilized in order to prevent degradation of the nucleic acid by various approaches, particularly, when RNA or mRNA is used as a lyophilized nucleic acid. It is known in the art that instability and (fast) degradation of mRNA or of RNA in general may represent a serious problem in the application of RNA based compositions. This instability of RNA is typically due to RNA-degrading enzymes, "RNAases" (ribonucleases), wherein contamination with such ribonucleases may sometimes completely degrade RNA in solution. Accordingly, the natural degradation of mRNA in the cytoplasm of cells is very finely regulated and RNase contaminations may be generally removed by special treatment prior to use of said compositions, in particular with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). A number of mechanisms of natural degradation are known in this connection in the prior art, which may be utilized as well. E.g., the terminal structure is typically of critical importance for a mRNA. As an example, at the 5' end of naturally occurring mRNAs there is usually a so-called "cap structure" (a modified guanosine nucleotide), and at the 3' end is typically a sequence of up to 200 adenosine nucleotides (the so-called poly-A tail). 
The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, particularly if provided as a mRNA, can therefore be stabilized against degradation by RNases by the addition of a so- called "5' cap" structure. Particular preference is given in this connection to an m7G(5')ppp (5'(A,G(5')ppp(5')A or G(5')ppp(5')G as the 5' cap" structure. However, such a modification is introduced only if a modification, for example a lipid modification, has not already been introduced at the 5' end of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention if provided as a mRNA or if the modification does not interfere with the immunogenic properties of the (unmodified or chemically modified) lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention. 
According to a further preferred embodiment, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention may contain, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, a poly-A tail on the 3' terminus of typically about 10 to 200 adenosine nucleotides, preferably about 10 to 100 adenosine nucleotides, more preferably about 20 to 100 adenosine nucleotides or even more preferably about 40 to 80 adenosine nucleotides. 
According to a further preferred embodiment, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention may contain, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, a poly-C tail on the 3' terminus of typically about 10 to 200 cytosine nucleotides, preferably about 10 to 100 cytosine nucleotides, more preferably about 20 to 70 cytosine nucleotides or even more preferably about 20 to 60 or even 10 to 40 cytosine nucleotides. According to another embodiment, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention may be modified, and thus stabilized, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, by modifying the G/C content of the nucleic acid, particularly an mRNA, preferably of the coding region thereof. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the G/C content of the coding region of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is modified, particularly increased, compared to the G/C content of the coding region of its particular wild type mRNA, i.e. the unmodified mRNA. The encoded amino acid sequence of the at least one mRNA is preferably not modified compared to the coded amino acid sequence of the particular wild type mRNA. 
This modification of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is based on the fact that the sequence of any mRNA region to be translated is important for efficient translation of that mRNA. Thus, the composition and the sequence of various nucleotides is important. In particular, sequences having an increased G (guanosine)/C (cytosine) content are more stable than sequences having an increased A (adenosine)/U (uracil) content. According to the invention, the codons of the mRNA are therefore varied compared to its wild type mRNA, while retaining the translated amino acid sequence, such that they include an increased amount of G/C nucleotides. In respect to the fact that several codons code for one and the same amino acid (so-called degeneration of the genetic code), the most favorable codons for the stability can be determined (so-called alternative codon usage). 
Depending on the amino acid to be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, there are various possibilities for modification of the at least one mRNA sequence, compared to its wild type sequence. In the case of amino acids which are encoded by codons which contain exclusively G or C nucleotides, no modification of the codon is necessary. Thus, the codons for Pro (CCC or CCG), Arg (CGC or CGG), Ala (GCC or GCG) and Gly (GGC or GGG) require no modification, since no A or U is present. In contrast, codons which contain A and/or U nucleotides can be modified by substitution of other codons which code for the same amino acids but contain no A and/or U. Examples of these are: the codons for Pro can be modified from CCU or CCA to CCC or CCG; 
the codons for Arg can be modified from CGU or CGA or AG A or AGG to CGC or CGG; the codons for Ala can be modified from GCU or GCA to GCC or GCG; 
the codons for Gly can be modified from GGU or GGA to GGC or GGG. 
In other cases, although A or U nucleotides cannot be eliminated from the codons, it is however possible to decrease the A and U content by using codons which contain a lower content of A and/or U nucleotides. Examples of these are: the codons for Phe can be modified from UUU to UUC; the codons for Leu can be modified from UUA, UUG, CUU or CUA to CUC or CUG; 
the codons for Ser can be modified from UCU or UCA or AGU to UCC, UCG or AGC; the codon for Tyr can be modified from UAU to UAC; 
the codon for Cys can be modified from UGU to UGC; 
the codon for His can be modified from CAU to CAC; 
the codon for Gin can be modified from CAA to CAG; 
the codons for lie can be modified from AUU or AUA to AUC; 
the codons for Thr can be modified from ACU or ACA to ACC or ACG; 
the codon for Asn can be modified from AAU to AAC; 
the codon for Lys can be modified from AAA to AAG; 
the codons for Val can be modified from GUU or GUA to GUC or GUG; 
the codon for Asp can be modified from GAU to GAC; 
the codon for Glu can be modified from GAA to GAG; 
the stop codon UAA can be modified to UAG or UGA. 
In the case of the codons for Met (AUG) and Trp (UGG), on the other hand, there is no possibility of sequence modification. 
The substitutions listed above can be used either individually or in all possible combinations to increase the G/C content of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, compared to its particular wild type mRNA (i.e. the original sequence). Thus, for example, all codons for Thr occurring in the wild type sequence can be modified to ACC (or ACG). Preferably, however, for example, combinations of the above substitution possibilities are used: substitution of all codons coding for Thr in the original sequence (wild type mRNA) to ACC (or ACG) and 
substitution of all codons originally coding for Ser to UCC (or UCG or AGC); 
substitution of all codons coding for lie in the original sequence to AUC and 
substitution of all codons originally coding for Lys to AAG and 
substitution of all codons originally coding for Tyr to UAC; 
substitution of all codons coding for Val in the original sequence to GUC (or GUG) and substitution of all codons originally coding for Glu to GAG and substitution of codons originally coding for Ala to GCC (or GCG) and 
substitution of codons originally coding for Arg to CGC (or CGG); 
substitution of codons coding for Val in the original sequence to GUC (or GUG) and substitution of codons originally coding for Glu to GAG and 
substitution of codons originally coding for Ala to GCC (or GCG) and 
substitution of codons originally coding for Gly to GGC (or GGG) and 
substitution of codons originally coding for Asn to AAC; 
substitution of codons coding for Val in the original sequence to GUC (or GUG) and substitution of codons originally coding for Phe to UUC and 
substitution of codons originally coding for Cys to UGC and 
substitution of codons originally coding for Leu to CUG (or CUC) and 
substitution of codons originally coding for Gin to CAG and 
substitution of codons originally coding for Pro to CCC (or CCG); etc. Preferably, the G/C content of the coding region of lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is increased by at least 7%, more preferably by at least 15%, particularly preferably by at least 20%, compared to the G/C content of the coded region of the wild type mRNA. According to a specific embodiment at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, more preferably at least 70 %, even more preferably at least 80% and most preferably at least 90%, 95% or even 100% of the substitutable codons in the region coding for a protein or peptide as defined herein or its fragment or variant thereof or the whole sequence of the wild type mRNA sequence are substituted, thereby increasing the GC content of said sequence. In this context, it is particularly preferable to increase the G/C content of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, to the maximum (i.e. 100% of the substitutable codons), in particular in the region coding for a protein, compared to the wild type sequence. 
According to the invention, a further preferred modification of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is based on the finding that the translation efficiency is also determined by a different frequency in the occurrence of tRNAs in cells. Thus, if so-called "rare codons" are present in the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, to an increased extent, the corresponding modified nucleic acid sequence is translated to a significantly poorer degree than in the case where codons coding for relatively "frequent" tRNAs are present. 
Especially if the modified lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention is in the form of a mRNA, the coding region of the modified lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is preferably modified compared to the corresponding region of the wild type mRNA such that at least one codon of the wild type sequence which codes for a tRNA which is relatively rare in the cell is exchanged for a codon which codes for a tRNA which is relatively frequent in the cell and carries the same amino acid as the relatively rare tRNA. By this modification, the sequences of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is modified such that codons for which frequently occurring tRNAs are available are inserted. In other words, according to the invention, by this modification all codons of the wild type sequence which code for a tRNA which is relatively rare in the cell can in each case be exchanged for a codon which codes for a tRNA which is relatively frequent in the cell and which, in each case, carries the same amino acid as the relatively rare tRNA. Which tRNAs occur relatively frequently in the cell and which, in contrast, occur relatively rarely is known to a person skilled in the art; cf. e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Akashi, Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001 , 1 1 (6): 660-666</bibl>. The codons which use for the particular amino acid the tRNA which occurs the most frequently, e.g. the Gly codon, which uses the tRNA which occurs the most frequently in the (human) cell, are particularly preferred. 
According to the invention, it is particularly preferable to link the sequential G/C content which is increased, in particular maximized, in the modified lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, with the "frequent" codons without modifying the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the coding region of the nucleic acid. This preferred embodiment allows provision of a particularly efficiently translated and stabilized (modified) lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA. The determination of a modified lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention as described above (increased G/C content; exchange of tRNAs) can be carried out using the computer program explained in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 02/098443</bibl> - the disclosure content of which is included in its full scope in the present invention. Using this computer program, the nucleotide sequence of any desired nucleic acid or mRNA can be modified with the aid of the genetic code or the degenerative nature thereof such that a maximum G/C content results, in combination with the use of codons which code for tRNAs occurring as frequently as possible in the cell, and the amino acid sequence coded by the modified lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention preferably not being modified compared to the non-modified sequence. Alternatively, it is also possible to modify only the G/C content or only the codon usage compared to the original sequence. The source code in Visual Basic 6.0 (development environment used: Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 6.0 with Servicepack 3) is also described in <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WO 02/098443</bibl>. 
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the A/U content in the environment of the ribosome binding site of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is increased compared to the A/U content in the environment of the ribosome binding site of its particular wild type mRNA. This modification (an increased A/U content around the ribosome binding site) increases the efficiency of ribosome binding to the nucleic acid. An effective binding of the ribosomes to the ribosome binding site (Kozak sequence: GCCGCCACCAUGG (SEQ ID NO: 3), the AUG forms the start codon) in turn has the effect of an efficient translation of the nucleic acid. 
According to a further embodiment the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, may be modified with respect to potentially destabilizing sequence elements. Particularly, the coding region and/or the 5' and/or 3' untranslated region of this lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may be modified compared to the particular wild type nucleic acid such that is contains no destabilizing sequence elements, the coded amino acid sequence of the modified lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, preferably not being modified compared to its particular wild type nucleic acid. It is known that, for example, in sequences of eukaryotic RNAs destabilizing sequence elements (DSE) occur, to which signal proteins bind and regulate enzymatic degradation of RNA. For further stabilization of the modified lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, optionally in the region which encodes for a protein or a peptide as defined herein, one or more such modifications compared to the corresponding region of the wild type nucleic acid can therefore be carried out, so that no or substantially no destabilizing sequence elements are contained there. According to the invention, DSE present in the untranslated regions (3'- and/or 5'-UTR) can also be eliminated from the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, by such modifications. 
Such destabilizing sequences are e.g. AU-rich sequences (AURES), which occur in 3'-UTR sections of numerous unstable RNAs (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Caput et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1986, 83: 1 670 to 1674</bibl>). The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is therefore preferably modified compared to the wild type nucleic acid such that the modified nucleic acid contains no such destabilizing sequences. This also applies to those sequence motifs which are recognized by possible endonucleases, e.g. the sequence GAACAAG, which is contained in the 3'-UTR segment of the gene which codes for the transferrin receptor (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Binder et al., EMBO J. 1 994, 13: 1 969 to 1980</bibl>). These sequence motifs are also preferably removed in the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA. Also preferably, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, has, in a modified form, at least one IRES as defined above and/or at least one 5' and/or 3' stabilizing sequence, in a modified form, e.g. to enhance ribosome binding or to allow expression of different encoded proteins located on the at least one (bi- or even multicistronic) RNA of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention. 
According to the invention, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as described herein, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, furthermore preferably has at least one 5' and/or 3' stabilizing sequence. These stabilizing sequences in the 5' and/or 3' untranslated regions have the effect of increasing the half-life of the nucleic acid in the cytosol. These stabilizing sequences can have 100% sequence identity to naturally occurring sequences which occur in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes, but can also be partly or completely synthetic. The untranslated sequences (UTR) of the (alpha-)globin gene, e.g. from Homo sapiens or Xenopus laevis may be mentioned as an example of stabilizing sequences which can be used in the present invention for a stabilized lyophilized nucleic acid. Another example of a stabilizing sequence has the general formula (C/U)CCANxCCC(U/A)PyxUC(C/U)CC (SEQ ID NO: 4), which is contained in the 3'UTR of the very stable RNA which codes for (alpha-)globin, type(l)-collagen, 15-lipoxygenase or for tyrosine hydroxylase (cf. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Holcik et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1997, 94: 2410 to 2414</bibl>). Such stabilizing sequences can of course be used individually or in combination with one another and also in combination with other stabilizing sequences known to a person skilled in the art. The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, is therefore preferably present as (alpha-)globin UTR (untranslated regions)-stabilized RNA, in particular as (alpha-)globin UTR-stabilized RNA. 
Nevertheless, substitutions, additions or eliminations of bases are preferably carried out with the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, using a DNA matrix for preparation of the nucleic acid lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention by techniques of the well known site directed mutagenesis or with an oligonucleotide ligation strategy (see e.g. <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Maniatis et a/., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 2001</bibl> ). In such a process, for preparation of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, a corresponding DNA molecule may be transcribed in vitro. This DNA matrix preferably comprises a suitable promoter, e.g. a T7 or SP6 promoter, for in vitro transcription, which is followed by the desired nucleotide sequence for the nucleic acid, e.g. mRNA, to be prepared and a termination signal for in vitro transcription. The DNA molecule, which forms the matrix of at least one RNA of interest, may be prepared by fermentative proliferation and subsequent isolation as part of a plasmid which can be replicated in bacteria. Plasmids which may be mentioned as suitable for the present invention are e.g. the plasmids pT7Ts (GenBank accession number U26404; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lai et a/., Development 1995, 121 : 2349 to 2360</bibl>), pGEM&lt;(R)&gt; series, e.g. pGEM&lt;(R)&gt;-1 (GenBank accession number X65300; from Promega) and pSP64 (GenBank accession number X65327); cf. also <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mezei and Storts, Purification of PCR Products, in: Griffin and Griffin (ed.)</bibl>, <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">PCR Technology: Current Innovation, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 2001</bibl> . 
Nucleic acid molecules used according to the invention as defined above may be prepared using any method known in the art, including synthetic methods such as e.g. solid phase synthesis, as well as in vitro methods, such as in vitro transcription reactions. According to another particularly preferred embodiment, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, may additionally or alternatively encode a secretory signal peptide. Such signal peptides are sequences, which typically exhibit a length of about 1 5 to 30 amino acids and are preferably located at the N-terminus of the encoded peptide, without being limited thereto. Signal peptides as defined herein preferably allow the transport of the protein or peptide as encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, into a defined cellular compartiment, preferably the cell surface, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the endosomal-lysosomal compartiment. Examples of secretory signal peptide sequences as defined herein include, without being limited thereto, signal sequences of classical or non-classical MHC-molecules (e.g. signal sequences of MHC I and II molecules, e.g. of the MHC class I molecule HLA-A*0201 ), signal sequences of cytokines or immunoglobulines as defined herein, signal sequences of the invariant chain of immunoglobulines or antibodies as defined herein, signal sequences of Lampl , Tapasin, Erp57, Calretikulin, Calnexin, and further membrane associated proteins or of proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the endosomal-lysosomal compartiment. Particularly preferably, signal sequences of MHC class I molecule HLA- A*0201 may be used according to the present invention. 
Any of the above modifications may be applied to the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of a mRNA, and further to any lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as used in the context of the present invention and may be, if suitable or necessary, be combined with each other in any combination, provided, these combinations of modifications do not interfere with each other in the respective lyophilized nucleic acid. A person skilled in the art will be able to take his choice accordingly. 
The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as well as proteins or peptides as encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention as defined above, may comprise fragments or variants of those sequences. Such fragments or variants may typically comprise a sequence having a sequence identity with one of the above mentioned nucleic acids, or with one of the proteins or peptides or sequences, if encoded by the nucleic acid sequences of at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, equally more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 95% or even 97%, to the entire wild type sequence, either on nucleic acid level or on amino acid level. 
"Fragments" of proteins or peptides in the context of the present invention (encoded by a nucleic acid as defined herein) may comprise a sequence of a protein or peptide as defined above, which is, with regard to its amino acid sequence (or its encoded nucleic acid sequence), N-terminally, C-terminally and/or intrasequentially truncated compared to the amino acid sequence of the original (native) protein (or its encoded nucleic acid sequence). Such truncation may thus occur either on the amino acid level or correspondingly on the nucleic acid level. A sequence identity with respect to such a fragment as defined above may therefore preferably refer to the entire protein or peptide as defined above or to the entire (coding) nucleic acid sequence of such a protein or peptide. Likewise, "fragments" of nucleic acids in the context of the present invention may comprise a sequence of a nucleic acid as defined above, which is, with regard to its nucleic acid sequence 5'-, 3'- and/or intrasequentially truncated compared to the nucleic acid sequence of the original (native) nucleic acid sequence. A sequence identity with respect to such a fragment as defined above may therefore preferably refer to the entire nucleic acid as defined above. 
Fragments of proteins or peptides in the context of the present invention (encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein) may furthermore comprise a sequence of a protein or peptide as defined above, which has a length of about 6 to about 20 or even more amino acids, e.g. fragments as processed and presented by MHC class I molecules, preferably having a length of about 8 to about 10 amino acids, e.g. 8, 9, or 10, (or even 6, 7, 1 1 , or 12 amino acids), or fragments as processed and presented by MHC class II molecules, preferably having a length of about 1 3 or more amino acids, e.g. 1 3, 14, 1 5, 1 6, 1 , 1 8, 1 9, 20 or even more amino acids, wherein these fragments may be selected from any part of the amino acid sequence. These fragments are typically recognized by T- cells in form of a complex consisting of the peptide fragment and an MHC molecule, i.e. the fragments are typically not recognized in their native form. 
Fragments of proteins or peptides as defined herein (encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein) may also comprise epitopes of those proteins or peptides. Epitopes (also called "antigen determinants") in the context of the present invention are typically fragments located on the outer surface of (native) proteins or peptides as defined herein, preferably having 5 to 1 5 amino acids, more preferably having 5 to 12 amino acids, even more preferably having 6 to 9 amino acids, which may be recognized by antibodies or B-cell receptors, i.e. in their native form. Such epitopes of proteins or peptides may furthermore be selected from any of the herein mentioned variants of such proteins or peptides. In this context antigenic determinants can be conformational or discontinous epitopes which are composed of segments of the proteins or peptides as defined herein that are discontinuous in the amino acid sequence of the proteins or peptides as defined herein but are brought together in the three-dimensional structure or continuous or linear epitopes which are composed of a single polypeptide chain. 
"Variants" of proteins or peptides as defined above may be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, wherein nucleic acids of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, encoding the protein or peptide as defined above, are exchanged. Thereby, a protein or peptide may be generated, having an amino acid sequence which differs from the original sequence in one or more mutation(s), such as one or more substituted, inserted and/or deleted amino acid(s). Preferably, these fragments and/or variants have the same biological function or specific activity compared to the full- length native potein, e.g. its specific antigenic property. 
The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention may also encode a protein or peptide as defined above, wherein the encoded amino acid sequence comprises conservative amino acid substitution(s) compared to its physiological sequence. Those encoded amino acid sequences as well as their encoding nucleotide sequences in particular fall under the term variants as defined above. Substitutions in which amino acids which originate from the same class are exchanged for one another are called conservative substitutions. In particular, these are amino acids having aliphatic side chains, positively or negatively charged side chains, aromatic groups in the side chains or amino acids, the side chains of which can enter into hydrogen bridges, e.g. side chains which have a hydroxyl function. This means that e.g. an amino acid having a polar side chain is replaced by another amino acid having a likewise polar side chain, or, for example, an amino acid characterized by a hydrophobic side chain is substituted by another amino acid having a likewise hydrophobic side chain (e.g. serine (threonine) by threonine (serine) or leucine (isoleucine) by isoleucine (leucine)). Insertions and substitutions are possible, in particular, at those sequence positions which cause no modification to the three-dimensional structure or do not affect the binding region. Modifications to a three-dimensional structure by insertion(s) or deletion(s) can easily be determined e.g. using CD spectra (circular dichroism spectra) (Urry, 1985, Absorption, Circular Dichroism and ORD of Polypeptides, in: Modern Physical Methods in Biochemistry, Neuberger eta/, (ed.), Elsevier, Amsterdam). 
Furthermore, variants of proteins or peptides as defined above, which may be encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention, may also comprise those sequences, wherein nucleic acids of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) are exchanged according to the degeneration of the genetic code, without leading to an alteration of respective amino acid sequence of the protein or peptide, i.e. the amino acid sequence or at least part thereof may not differ from the original sequence in one or more mutation(s) within the above meaning. 
In order to determine the percentage to which two sequences (nucleic acid sequences, e.g. nucleic acid sequences as defined herein, or amino acid sequences, preferably their encoded amino acid sequences, e.g. the amino acid sequences of the proteins or peptides as defined above) are identical, the sequences can be aligned in order to be subsequently compared to one another. Therefore, e.g. gaps can be inserted into the sequence of the first sequence and the component at the corresponding position of the second sequence can be compared. If a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same component as is the case at a position in the second sequence, the two sequences are identical at this position. The percentage to which two sequences are identical is a function of the number of identical positions divided by the total number of positions. The percentage to which two sequences are identical can be determined using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, but not limiting, example of a mathematical algorithm which can be used is the algorithm of <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Karlin et a/. (1993), PNAS USA, 90:5873-5877</bibl> or <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Altschul et a/. (1997), Nucleic Acids Res., 25:3389-3402</bibl>. Such an algorithm is integrated in the BLAST program. Sequences which are identical to the sequences of the present invention to a certain extent can be identified by this program. In the context of the present invention, the nucleic acid as defined above is typically present in a lactate containing solution prior to lyophilization. In this context, the lactate is typically already contained in or added to the nucleic acid as defined above to form such a solution, or vice versa. The nucleic acid and lactate containing solution prior to lyophilization may additionally contain water, preferably water for injection (WFI). In this context, the term "water for injection" (WFI) is a term defined by standard USP 23. USP 23 monograph states that " Water for Injection (WFI) is water purified by distillation or reverse osmosis." WFI is typically produced by either distillation or 2-stage reverse osmosis. WFI typically does not contain more than 0.25 USP endotoxin units (EU) per ml. Endotoxins are a class of pyrogens that are components of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria (the most common type of bacteria in water), preferably in an action limit of 10 cfu/100 ml. The microbial quality may be tested by membrane filtration of a 100 ml sample and plate count agar at an incubation temperature of 30 to 35 degrees Celsius for a 48-hour period. The chemical purity requirements of WFI are typically the same as of PW (purified water). Upon lyophilization, the (residual) water content of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein is typically reduced to a content of about 0.5 % (w/w) to about 10 % (w/w), more preferably to a content of about 1 % (w/w) to about 5 % (w/w), even more preferably to a content of about 2 % (w/w) to about 4% (w/w), most preferably to a content of about 3 % (w/w), e.g. 3 % (w/w) + 2 % (w/w), or 3 % (w/w) +- 1 % (w/w). 
The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein and preferably the nucleic acid and lactate containing solution prior to lyophilization may contain, additional to the nucleic acid and the lactate, further components or additives, e.g. a cryoprotectant, a lyoprotectant or any further suitable additive, preferably as defined in the following. 
As a particularly preferred component or additive, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein and preferably the nucleic acid and lactate containing solution prior to lyophilization may additionally contain at least one suspending agent, preferably mannit, preferably in a concentration of about 1 to 15% (w/w), more preferably in a concentration of about 3 to 10% (w/w), and even more preferably in a concentration of about 4 to 6% (w/w). 
As a further component, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein and preferably the nucleic acid and lactate containing solution prior to lyophilization may additionally contain at least one component or additive selected, e.g., from proteins, amino acids, alcohols, carbohydrates, mannose, mannit, metals or metal ions, surfactants, polymers or complexing agents, buffers, etc., or a combination thereof. 
In the context of the present invention, one preferred component or additive may also be selected from the group of amino acids. Such group may may comprise, without being limited thereto, any naturally occurring amino acid, including alanine, cysteine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, phenylalanine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, leucine, methionine, asparagine, pyrrolysine, proline, glutamine, arginine, serine, threonine, selenocysteine, valine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, more preferably glycine, arginine, and alanine. Cryoprotectants and/or lyoprotectants selected from the group of amino acids may additionally comprise any modification of a naturally occurring amino acid as defined above. 
Furthermore, in the context of the present invention, a further component or additive may be selected from the group of alcohols. Such group may comprise, without being limited thereto, any alcohol suitable for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition, preferably, without being limited thereto, mannitol, polyethyleneglycol, polypropyleneglycol, sorbitol, etc. Additionally, in the context of the present invention, a further component or additive may be selected from the group of carbohydrates. Such group may comprise, without being limited thereto, any carbohydrate, suitable for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition, preferably, without being limited thereto, monosaccharides, such as e.g. glucose, fructose, (free) mannose (i.e. not covalently bound), etc., disaccharides, such as e.g. lactose, maltose, sucrose, trehalose, etc., and polysaccharides, such as e.g. dextran, HP- beta CD, etc. 
According to a particularly preferred embodiment, mannose as a further component or additive is a D-Mannose. D-Mannose may be depicted according to at least one of the D- Mannose isomers a-D-Mannofuranose, [beta]-D-Mannofuranose, a-D-Mannopyranose and [beta]-D- Mannopyranose. Typically, the occurrence of the different mannose isomers in nature significantly differs. D-Mannose forms anomers, wherein a-D-Mannofuranose ocurrs in a concentration/frequency of less than 1 %, [beta]-D-Mannofuranose in a concentration/frequency of less than 1 %, a-D-Mannopyranose in a concentration/frequency of about 67 % and [beta]-D- Mannopyranose in a concentration/frequency of about 33 %. Thus, D-Mannose may be selected more preferably from at least one, two, three or four of the anomers a-D- Mannofuranose, [beta]-D-Mannofuranose, [alpha]-D-Mannopyranose and/or [beta]-D-Mannopyranose. Importantly, upon solubilization in an aqueous solution mannose typically forms the above anomers in an equilibrity reaction, typically in the above concentrations. According to an even more preferred embodiment, mannose as a further component or additive is selected from an anomeric mixture of D-Mannose, preferably an anomeric mixture comprising a-D- Mannofuranose, [beta]-D-Mannofuranose, [alpha]-D-Mannopyranose and [beta]-D-Mannopyranose, more preferably in the above concentrations/frequencies. Alternatively, but less preferred, mannose as a further component or additive may be selected from L-mannose or a racemic mixture of D-Mannose and/or L-Mannose, wherein D-mannose is preferably as described above. Such mixtures may be obtained e.g. by a non-selective synthesis of mannose, e.g. by non-selective oxidation of mannitol. An anomeric mixture may furthermore be obtained by solubilization of mannose in an aqueous solution, e.g. in water, WFI, or any buffer or solution as defined herein. According to a more particular embodiment, mannose as a further component or additive is typically present in the inventive solution for lyophilization, transfection and/or injection in a concentration of about 0.01 to about 10% (w/w), preferably in a concentration of about 0.01 to about 10% (w/w), more preferably in a concentration of about 0.1 to about 7.5% (w/w), even more preferably in a concentration of about 0.5 to about 5% (w/w), and most preferably in a concentration of about 1 to about 4% (w/w), e.g. a concentration of about 2 to about 4% (w/w), such as about 2.5 % (w/w). Herein, a concentration of about 1 % (w/w) mannose corresponds to a concentration of about 55,506 mM mannose. Any of the above and herein mentioned values and concentrations for mannose in % (w/w) may thus be calculated in mM on the above basis. 
Also, in the context of the present invention, a further suitable component or additive may be selected from the group of proteins. Such group may comprise, without being limited thereto, proteins such as albumin, gelatine, therapeutically active proteins as defined above, antibodies as defined above, antigens as defined above, or any further protein encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention as defined above. 
A component or additive, which may be contained in the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein and accordingly in the nucleic acid and lactate containing solution prior to lyophilization may be selected from the group of metals or metal ions, typically comprising, without being limited thereto, metals or metal ions or salts selected from 
alkali metals, including members of group 1 of the periodic table: lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr), and their (monovalent) metal alkali metal ions and salts; preferably lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), and their (monovalent) metal alkali metal ions and salts; 
alkaline earth metals, including members of group 2 of the periodic table: beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba) and radium (Ra), and their (divalent) alkaline earth metal ions and salts; preferably magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba) and their (divalent) alkaline earth metal ions and salts; 
transition metals, including members of groups 3 to 13 of the periodic table and their metal ions and salts;. The transition metals typically comprise the 40 chemical elements 21 to 30, 39 to 48, 71 to 80, and 103 to 1 12. The name transition originates from their position in the periodic table of elements. In each of the four periods in which they occur, these elements represent the successive addition of electrons to the d atomic orbitals of the atoms.

Finally, the nucleic acid and lactate containing solution prior to lyophilization (as well as after reconstituting the lyophilized nucleic acid) may contain the herein defined contents, optional components, additives, etc. in such a concentration so as to lead to an osmolality comparable to that of blood plasma. In this context, the term "osmolality" is typically to be understood as a measure of all contents, optional components, additives, etc. of the nucleic acid and lactate containing solution prior to lyophilization (as well as after reconstituting the lyophilized nucleic acid) as defined herein. More precisely, osmolality is typically the measure of solute concentration, defined as the number of osmoles (Osm) of all solubilized contents, optional components, additives, etc. per liter (I) of solution (osmol/l or osm/l).

The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein typically comprises an excellent enhanced storage-stability, when compared to a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the art, which has been lyophilized without the presence of lactate, e.g. in the presence of water for injection (WFI) as described herein. The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined and as prepared herein advantageously can be stored in a temperature range of about -80[deg.]C to +60[deg.]C significantly longer, when compared to a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the art. The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein even allows presence of additional ingredients, such as salts, metalloids, metal anions or further ingredients as defined above, which have been formerly regarded as problematic or even instabilizing the lyophilized nucleic acid. According to the present invention, the storage- stability of the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is calculated on the basis of the relative integrity of the nucleic acid. The relative integrity of the nucleic acid in the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is typically defined as the relative content of the nucleic acid exhibiting a correct length when compared to the total content of nucleic acid in the sample, in the context of an mRNA, the relative integrity of the mRNA in the lyophilized mRNA is typically defined as the relative content of the mRNA exhibiting a correct length when compared to the total content of mRNA in the sample. The storage-stability of a nucleic acid is typically determined on the basis of the relative integrity (over a defined or not defined period of time), wherein the nucleic acid typically exhibits an unchangend biological activity. In the context of the present invention the storage stability is preferably regarded as complied with, if the relative integrity of the (lyophilized) nucleic acid(s) is at least about 60 to 80%, preferably at least about 70 %. A relative integrity of more than 70 % meets the quality criteria of CureVac GmbH for mRNA exhibiting a GC-content of more than 60 % and a base length of &lt;2000 nt in RNA containing formulations. This criterium may be applied to the above definition. 
According to a further embodiment, the present invention also provides a method of lyophilization of a nucleic acid, preferably for preparation of a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) according to the present invention as defined above. I.e., the inventive lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined according to the present invention is preferably prepared according to the herein described inventive method for lyophilization of a nucleic acid. The inventive method of lyophilization of a nucleic acid preferably leads to an enhanced storage stability of the nucleic acid. The method typically comprises the following steps: 
 a) optionally providing a nucleic acid containing sample, which has been supplemented with a lactate as defined herein, and optionally supplemented with further ingredients as defined above; 
 b) freezing the nucleic acid containing sample, obtained according to step a); 
 c) drying the freeze-dried nucleic acid containing sample, obtained according to step b), via sublimation; 
 d) optionally floating the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, etc., or a noble gas, such as helium, neon, argon, xenon, krypton; 
 e) optionally sealing the lyophilized nucleic acid. The inventive method is directed to a method of lyophilization of a nucleic acid. Lyophilization (also termed cryodesiccation) is typically understood as a process, which allows removing water from a frozen sample (containing at least one nucleic acid and a lactate containing solution, preferably as defined above) in one or more steps via sublimation. In the context of the present invention, lyophilization is typically carried out by freeze-drying a sample first freezing a nucleic acid containing sample, which has been supplemented with a lactate as defined herein, and then drying the nucleic acid containing sample via sublimation, optionally by reducing the surrounding pressure and/or adding enough heat to allow the frozen water in the sample to sublime directly from the solid phase to gas. 
According to an optional first step a) of the inventive method of lyophilization a nucleic acid containing sample, which has been supplemented with a lactate as defined herein, and optionally supplemented with further ingredients as defined above, is provided. The nucleic acid and the lactate are preferably as defined above for the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention. The nucleic acid containing sample may be prepared either by adding a lactate as defined above, preferably in the above defined concentrations, to a sample containing a nucleic acid as defined above, or by adding a sample containing a nucleic acid as defined above to a lactate containing sample, preferably a lactate as defined above in the above defined concentrations. The nucleic acid containing sample, which has been supplemented with a lactate as defined herein, may additionally be supplemented with further ingredients, preferably as defined above for the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) of the present invention. According to the second step b) the sample, containing the at least one nucleic acid and a lactate as defined herein, is frozen. The freezing process may be carried out by any method, which allows to (entirely) freeze the sample. In a lab, this may be done by placing the material in a freeze-drying flask and rotating the flask in a bath, called a shell freezer, which is cooled by mechanical refrigeration, dry ice and methanol, or liquid nitrogen. On a larger- scale, freezing is usually carried out using a freeze-drying machine. In this step, it is important to cool the material below its triple point, the lowest temperature at which the solid and liquid phases of the material can coexist. This ensures that sublimation rather than melting will occur in the following steps. Larger crystals are easier to freeze-dry. Usually, the freezing temperatures are in the range between -0 [deg.]C and -80 [deg.]C, or between -20 [deg.]C and -80 [deg.]C, preferably in the range between -30 [deg.]C and -60 [deg.]C, even more preferably in the range between -40 [deg.]C and -50 [deg.]C, most preferably about -47 [deg.]C. According to a third step c), the frozen sample is dried, typically using two drying steps, primary drying step c1 ) and secondary drying step c2). During the primary drying step c1 ), free, i.e. unbound, water surrounding the nucleic acid and optionally further components, escapes from the solution. Subsequent thereto water being bound on a molecular basis by the nucleic acids may be removed in a secondary drying step c2) by adding thermal energy. In both cases the hydration sphere around the nucleic acids is lost. 
The primary drying step c1 ) may be carried out at normal pressure, e.g. in the range of about 980 to about 1045 millibar (mbar), e.g. about 1013 mbar, but also may be carried out by lowering the pressure, usually to the range of a few millibar, e.g. in the range of about 0.001 mbar to about 0.2 mbar, preferably in the range of about 0.01 mbar to about 0.1 mbar, even more preferably in the range of about 0.025 mbar to about 0.075 mbar, e.g. about 0.05 mbar. In this primary drying step, pressure is typically controlled through the application of partial vacuum. The vacuum allows speeding up sublimation, making it useful as a deliberate drying process. Furthermore, a cold condenser chamber and/or condenser plates may be used to provide (a) surface(s) for the water vapor to re-solidify on. Condenser temperatures are typically below -50 [deg.]C (-60 [deg.]F). Alternatively, instead of lowering the pressure, heat may be supplied to the sample to allow for the water to sublimate. The amount of heat necessary can be calculated using the sublimating molecules' latent heat of sublimation. In this initial drying phase, about 95% (w/w) of the water in the material is sublimated. This phase may be carried out slow to avoid applying too much heat and possible alteration or damage of the structure of the nucleic acid to be lyophilized. The heat, if applied, may be in the range of about -40 [deg.]C to about +20 [deg.]C, e.g. in the range of about -30 [deg.]C to about +20 [deg.]C, in the range of about -20 [deg.]C to about +20 [deg.]C, in the range of about -10 [deg.]C to about +10 [deg.]C, in the range of about -40 [deg.]C to about +10 [deg.]C, in the range of about -30 [deg.]C to about +10 [deg.]C, in the range of about -20 [deg.]C to about +10 [deg.]C, in the range of about -20 [deg.]C to about +/-0 [deg.]C, or in the range of about -10 [deg.]C to about +/-0 [deg.]C. As a further alternative, heat and low pressure may be applied, preferably heat in the range as defined above and a low pressure in the range as defined above. 
The secondary drying step c2) typically aims to remove unfrozen water molecules bound in the structure of the nucleic acids, since the ice (frozen water molecules) is usually removed in the primary drying step c! ) above. In this secondary drying step c2), the temperature is typically raised higher than in the primary drying step, and can even be above 0 [deg.]C, to break any physico-chemical interactions that have formed between the water molecules and the frozen material. Alternatively, the pressure may be lowered in this stage to encourage desorption. According to a further alternative, heat can be applied and pressure can be lowered, preferably in the above ranges. More preferably, the heat, if applied, may be in the range of about +1 0 [deg.]C to about +40 [deg.]C, preferably in the range of about +25 [deg.]C to about + 35[deg.]C, e.g. about 30 [deg.]C. The pressure, if lowered, is usually lowered to the range of a few millibars, e.g. as defined above, more preferably in the range of about 0.001 mbar to about 0.05 mbar, preferably in the range of about 0.001 mbar to about 0.025 mbar, even more preferably in the range of about 0.005 mbar to about 0.01 5 mbar, e.g. about 0.01 mbar. As a further alternative, heat and low pressure may be applied, preferably in the ranges as defined above. 
After the freeze-drying process is complete, i.e. steps b) and c), particularly c1 ) and c2), are finished, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) obtained according to steps b) and c), particularly c1 ) and c2), is typically floated in an optional step d) with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, etc., or a noble gas, such as helium, neon, argon, xenon, krypton, and/or the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is typically sealed. For this purpose, the vacuum is usually broken, e.g. to atmospheric pressure (preferably about 1 01 3 mbar), if low pressure was applied, and the temperature is typically adjusted to room temperature, if heat was used. 
Subsequently or alternatively to step d) of the inventive method of lyophilization, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is optionally sealed in step e) of the inventive method of lyophilization with or without an inert gas. For this purpose, the lyophi lized nucleic acid (sequence) is advantageously contained in any of the above mentioned steps a), b), c), and d) (and more preferably already lyophilized) in a sealable container. 
At the end of the lyophilization method as defined above, typically comprising optionally step a), step b) step c), particularly steps c1 ) and c2), and optionally step d) and/or step e), a lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is preferably obtained, wherein the final residual water content in the inventive lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) is preferably in the range of about 0.5 % (w/w) to about 10 % (w/w), more preferably in the range of about 1 % (w/w) to about 5 % (w/w), even more preferably in the range of about 2 % (w/w) to about 4% (w/w), most preferably in the range of about 3 % (w/w), e.g. 3 % (w/w) +- 2 % (w/w), or 3 % (w/w) + 1 % (w/w). The lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may additionally or alternatively to steps d) and/or e) be reconstituted in a solution to obtain a product which is ready to be used in any of the herein mentioned applications. Therefore, according to a particularly preferred embodiment, the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) may again be reconstituted in a buffer or a solution as defined above for reconstitution. Preferably, such a solution for reconstitution is a solution as defined above for the solution prior to lyophilization of the nucleic acid as defined herein, wherein the solution for reconstitution may contain at least one of the components as defined above for said solution except of the nucleic acid. Most preferred is an isotonic solution as defined herein for reconstitution. The reconstitution may occur, e.g., after lyophilization, e.g. as a further step f) of the abovementioned method for lyophilization. 
According to a further embodiment, the present invention furthermore provides a pharmaceutical composition, comprising the inventive lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined above and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or vehicle. The inventive pharmaceutical composition may optionally be supplemented with further components as defined above for the inventive lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence).

Particularly for injection of the inventive inventive pharmaceutical composition, water or preferably a buffer, more preferably an aqueous buffer, may be used, containing a sodium salt, preferably at least 50 mM of a sodium salt, a calcium salt, preferably at least 0.01 mM of a calcium salt, and optionally a potassium salt, preferably at least 3 mM of a potassium salt. According to a preferred embodiment, the sodium, calcium and, optionally, potassium salts may occur in the form of their halogenides, e.g. chlorides, iodides, or bromides, in the form of their hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, or sulfates, etc. Without being limited thereto, examples of sodium salts include e.g. NaCI, Nal, NaBr, Na2C03, NaHC03, Na2S04, examples of the optional potassium salts include e.g. KCI, Kl, KBr, K2C03, KHC03, K2S04, and examples of calcium salts include e.g. CaCl2, Cal2, CaBr2, CaC03, CaS04, Ca(OH)2. Furthermore, organic anions of the aforementioned cations may be contained in the buffer. According to a more preferred embodiment, the buffer suitable for injection purposes as defined above, may contain salts selected from sodium chloride (NaCI), calcium chloride (CaCI2) and optionally potassium chloride (KCI), wherein further anions may be present additional to the chlorides. CaCl2 can also be replaced by another salt like KCI. Typically, the salts in the injection buffer are present in a concentration of at least 50 mM sodium chloride (NaCI), at least 3 mM potassium chloride (KCI) and at least 0,01 mM calcium chloride (CaCI2). The injection buffer may be hypertonic, isotonic or hypotonic with reference to the specific reference medium, i.e. the buffer may have a higher, identical or lower salt content with reference to the specific reference medium, wherein preferably such concentrations of the afore mentioned salts may be used, which do not lead to damage of cells due to osmosis or other concentration effects. Reference media are e.g. liquids occurring in "in vivd' methods, such as blood, lymph, cytosolic liquids, or other body liquids, or e.g. liquids, which may be used as reference media in "in vitrd' methods, such as common buffers or liquids. Such common buffers or liquids are known to a skilled person and may be as defined above. 
However, one or more compatible solid or liquid fillers or diluents or encapsulating compounds may be used as well for the inventive pharmaceutical composition, which are suitable for administration to a patient to be treated. The term "compatible" as used here means that these constituents of the inventive pharmaceutical composition are capable of being mixed with the (lyophilized) nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein in such a manner that no interaction occurs which would substantially reduce the pharmaceutical effectiveness of the inventive pharmaceutical composition under typical use conditions. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, fillers and diluents must, of course, have sufficiently high purity and sufficiently low toxicity to make them suitable for administration to a person to be treated. Some examples of compounds which can be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, fillers or constituents thereof are sugars, such as, for example, lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as, for example, corn starch or potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives, such as, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; tallow; solid glidants, such as, for example, stearic acid, magnesium stearate; calcium sulfate; vegetable oi ls, such as, for example, groundnut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil from theobroma; polyols, such as, for example, polypropylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; alginic acid.
The inventive pharmaceutical composition may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional, intracranial, transdermal, intradermal, intrapulmonal, intraperitoneal, intracardial, intraarterial, and sublingual injection or infusion techniques. Preferably, the inventive pharmaceutical composition may be administered by parenteral injection, more preferably by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional, intracranial, transdermal, intradermal, intrapulmonal, intraperitoneal, intracardial, intraarterial, and sublingual injection or via infusion techniques. Sterile injectable forms of the inventive pharmaceutical compositions may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenteral ly-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1 ,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di- glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutical ly-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents that are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation of the inventive pharmaceutical composition. The inventive pharmaceutical composition as defined above may also be administered orally in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient, i.e. the at least one nucleic acid as defined above, e.g. the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined above, is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added. The inventive pharmaceutical composition may also be administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, e.g. including diseases of the skin or of any other accessible epithelial tissue. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs. For topical applications, the inventive pharmaceutical composition may be formulated in a suitable ointment, containing the components as defined above suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the inventive pharmaceutical composition can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream. In the context of the present invention, suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. 
The inventive pharmaceutical composition typically comprises a "safe and effective amount" of the components of the inventive pharmaceutical composition as defined above, particularly of the at least one (lyophilized) nucleic acid (sequence). As used herein, a "safe and effective amount" means an amount of the at least one (lyophilized) nucleic acid (sequence) that is sufficient to significantly induce a positive modification of a disease or disorder as defined herein. At the same time, however, a "safe and effective amount" is small enough to avoid serious side-effects, that is to say to permit a sensible relationship between advantage and risk. The determination of these limits typically lies within the scope of sensible medical judgment. A "safe and effective amount" of the components of the inventive pharmaceutical composition, particularly of the at least one (lyophilized) nucleic acid (sequence) will furthermore vary in connection with the particular condition to be treated and also with the age and physical condition of the patient to be treated, the body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the activity of the specific (lyophilized) nucleic acid (sequence) employed, the severity of the condition, the duration of the treatment, the nature of the accompanying therapy, of the particular pharmaceutically acceptable carrier used, and similar factors, within the knowledge and experience of the accompanying doctor. The inventive pharmaceutical composition may be used for human and also for veterinary medical purposes, preferably for human medical purposes, as a pharmaceutical composition in general or as a vaccine. 
According to a specific embodiment, the inventive pharmaceutical composition may be provided as a vaccine. Such an inventive vaccine is typically composed like the inventive pharmaceutical composition, i.e. it contains a (lyophilized) nucleic acid (sequence) as defined above and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or vehicle. Further components may be as defined above for the inventive pharmaceutical composition. The inventive vaccine preferably supports at least an innate immune response of the immune system of a patient to be treated. Additionally, the inventive vaccine furthermore may also elicit an adaptive immune response, preferably, if the at least one nucleic acid (sequence) of the inventive vaccine encodes any of the above mentioned antigens (or antibodies), which elicit an adaptive immune response or any antigen as defined above is added to the inventive vaccine which can effectively induce an adaptive immune response. 
The inventive vaccine may also comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, and/or vehicle as defined above for the inventive pharmaceutical composition. In the specific context of the inventive vaccine, the choice of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is determined in principle by the manner in which the inventive vaccine is administered. The inventive vaccine can be administered, for example, systemically or locally. Routes for systemic administration in general include, for example, transdermal, oral, parenteral routes, including subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intradermal and intraperitoneal injections and/or intranasal administration routes. Routes for local administration in general include, for example, topical administration routes but also intradermal, transdermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injections or intralesional, intracranial, intrapulmonal, intracardial, and sublingual injections. More preferably, vaccines herein may be administered by an intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular route. Inventive vaccines are therefore preferably formulated in liquid (or sometimes in solid) form. The suitable amount of the inventive vaccine to be administered can be determined by routine experiments with animal models. Such models include, without implying any limitation, rabbit, sheep, mouse, rat, dog and non-human primate models. Preferred unit dose forms for injection include sterile solutions of water, physiological saline or mixtures thereof. The pH of such solutions should be adjusted to about 7.4. Suitable carriers for injection include hydrogels, devices for controlled or delayed release, polylactic acid and collagen matrices. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for topical application include those which are suitable for use in lotions, creams, gels and the like. If the inventive vaccine is to be administered orally, tablets, capsules and the like are the preferred unit dose form. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for the preparation of unit dose forms which can be used for oral administration are well known in the prior art. The choice thereof will depend on secondary considerations such as taste, costs and storability, which are not critical for the purposes of the present invention, and can be made without difficulty by a person skilled in the art. 
The inventive vaccine can additionally contain one or more auxiliary substances in order to further increase its immunogenicity. A synergistic action of the at least one (lyophilized) nucleic acid sequence of the inventive vaccine and of an auxiliary substance, which may be optionally contained in the inventive vaccine as described above, is preferably achieved thereby. Depending on the various types of auxiliary substances, various mechanisms can come into consideration in this respect. For example, compounds that permit the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), for example lipopolysaccharides, TNF-alpha or CD40 ligand, form a first class of suitable auxiliary substances. In general, it is possible to use as auxiliary substance any agent that influences the immune system in the manner of a "danger signal" (LPS, GP96, etc.) or cytokines, such as GM-CFS, which allow an immune response produced by the immune-stimulating adjuvant according to the invention to be enhanced and/or influenced in a targeted manner. Particularly preferred auxiliary substances are cytokines, such as monokines, lymphokines, interleukins or chemokines, that further promote the innate immune response, such as IL-1 , IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL- 9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15, IL-1 6, IL-1 7, IL-18, IL-19, IL-20, IL-21 , IL-22, IL-23, IL- 24, IL-25, IL-26, IL-27, IL-28, IL-29, IL-30, IL-31 , IL-32, IL-33, INF-alpha, IFN-beta, INF- gamma, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, LT-beta or TNF-alpha, growth factors, such as hGH. 
Further additives which may be included in the inventive vaccine are emulsifiers, such as, for example, Tween&lt;(R)&gt;; wetting agents, such as, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate; colouring agents; taste-imparting agents, pharmaceutical carriers; tablet-forming agents; stabilizers; antioxidants; preservatives. The inventive vaccine can also additionally contain any further compound, which is known to be immune-stimulating due to its binding affinity (as ligands) to human Toll-like receptors TLR1 , TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, or due to its binding affinity (as ligands) to murine Toll-like receptors TLR1 , TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR1 1 , TLR12 or TLR13. 
Another class of compounds, which may be added to an inventive vaccine in this context, may be CpG nucleic acids, in particular CpG-RNA or CpG-DNA. A CpG-RNA or CpG- DNA can be a single-stranded CpG-DNA (ss CpG-DNA), a double-stranded CpG-DNA (dsDNA), a single-stranded CpG-RNA (ss CpG-RNA) or a double-stranded CpG-RNA (ds CpG-RNA). The CpG nucleic acid is preferably in the form of CpG-RNA, more preferably in the form of single-stranded CpG-RNA (ss CpG-RNA). The CpG nucleic acid preferably contains at least one or more (mitogenic) cytosine/guanine dinucleotide sequence(s) (CpG motif(s)). According to a first preferred alternative, at least one CpG motif contained in these sequences, that is to say the C (cytosine) and the G (guanine) of the CpG motif, is unmethylated. All further cytosines or guanines optionally contained in these sequences can be either methylated or unmethylated. According to a further preferred alternative, however, the C (cytosine) and the G (guanine) of the CpG motif can also be present in methylated form. The CpG nucleic acids may be provided either in solubilized or in lyophilized form, e.g. lyophilized using a method likewise as described herein for the inventive (lyophilized) nucleic acid (sequence). 
The present invention furthermore provides several applications and uses of the inventive lyophilized nucleic acid, preferably prepared according to the inventive method for lyophilization of a nucleic acid.

According to another specific embodiment, diseases as defined herein comprise autoimmune diseases as defined in the following. Autoimmune diseases can be broadly divided into systemic and organ-specific or localised autoimmune disorders, depending on the principal clinico-pathologic features of each disease. Autoimmune diseases may be divided into the categories of systemic syndromes, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome, Scleroderma, Rheumatoid Arthritis and polymyositis or local syndromes which may be endocrinologic (type I diabetes (Diabetes mellitus Type 1 ), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's disease etc.), dermatologic (pemphigus vulgaris), haematologic (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia), neural (multiple sclerosis) or can involve virtually any circumscribed mass of body tissue. The autoimmune diseases to be treated may be selected from the group consisting of type I autoimmune diseases or type II autoimmune diseases or type III autoimmune diseases or type IV autoimmune diseases, such as, for example, multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, type I diabetes (Diabetes mellitus Type 1 ), chronic polyarthritis, Basedow's disease, autoimmune forms of chronic hepatitis, colitis ulcerosa, type I allergy diseases, type II allergy diseases, type III allergy diseases, type IV allergy diseases, fibromyalgia, hair loss, Bechterew's disease, Crohn's disease, Myasthenia gravis, neurodermitis, Polymyalgia rheumatica, progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), Reiter's syndrome, rheumatic arthritis, psoriasis, vasculitis, etc, or type II diabetes. While the exact mode as to why the immune system induces an immune reaction against autoantigens has not been elucidated so far, there are several findings with regard to the etiology. Accordingly, the autoreaction may be due to a T-Cell bypass. A normal immune system requires the activation of B-cells by T-cells before the former can produce antibodies in large quantities. This requirement of a T-cell can be by-passed in rare instances, such as infection by organisms producing super-antigens, which are capable of initiating polyclonal activation of B-cells, or even of T-cells, by directly binding to the [beta]- subunit of T-cell receptors in a non-specific fashion. Another explanation deduces autoimmune diseases from a Molecular Mimicry. An exogenous antigen may share structural similarities with certain host antigens; thus, any antibody produced against this antigen (which mimics the self-antigens) can also, in theory, bind to the host antigens and amplify the immune response. The most striking form of molecular mimicry is observed in Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, which shares antigens with human myocardium, and is responsible for the cardiac manifestations of rheumatic fever. 
Additionally, according to one further specific embodiment, diseases as defined herein comprise allergies or allergic diseases, i.e. diseases related to allergies. Allergy is a condition that typically involves an abnormal, acquired immunological hypersensitivity to certain foreign antigens or allergens, such as the allergy antigens as defined above. Such allergy antigens or allergens may be selected from allergy antigens as defined above antigens derived from different sources, e.g. from animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, etc. Allergens in this context include e.g. grasses, pollens, molds, drugs, or numerous environmental triggers, etc. Allergies normally result in a local or systemic inflammatory response to these antigens or allergens and lead to immunity in the body against these allergens. Without being bound to theory, several different disease mechanisms are supposed to be involved in the development of allergies. According to a classification scheme by P. Gel I and R. Coombs the word "allergy" was restricted to type I hypersensitivities, which are caused by the classical IgE mechanism. Type I hypersensitivity is characterised by excessive activation of mast cells and basophils by IgE, resulting in a systemic inflammatory response that can result in symptoms as benign as a runny nose, to life-threatening anaphylactic shock and death. Well known types of allergies include, without being limited thereto, allergic asthma (leading to swelling of the nasal mucosa), allergic conjunctivitis (leading to redness and itching of the conjunctiva), allergic rhinitis ("hay fever"), anaphylaxis, angiodema, atopic dermatitis (eczema), urticaria (hives), eosinophilia, respiratory, allergies to insect stings, skin allergies (leading to and including various rashes, such as eczema, hives (urticaria) and (contact) dermatitis), food allergies, allergies to medicine, etc. Treatment of such allergic disorders or diseases may occur preferably by desensitizing the immune reaction which triggers a specific immune response. Such a desensitizing may be carried out by administering an effective amount of the allergen or allergic antigen encoded by the lyophilized nucleic acid (sequence) as defined herein, preferably, when formulated as a pharmaceutical composition, to induce a slight immune reaction. The amount of the allergen or allergic antigen may then be raised step by step in subsequent administrations until the immune system of the patient to be treated tolerates a specific amount of allergen or allergic antigen. Additionally, diseases to be treated in the context of the present invention likewise include (hereditary) diseases, or genetic diseases in general monogenetic diseases, i.e. (hereditary) diseases, or genetic diseases in general. Such (mono-)genetic diseases, (hereditary) diseases, or genetic diseases in general are typically caused by genetic defects, e.g. due to gene mutations resulting in loss of protein activity or regulatory mutations which do not allow transcription or translation of the protein. Frequently, these diseases lead to metabolic disorders or other symptoms, e.g. muscle dystrophy.

Any of the kits or kit of parts as described above may contain optionally technical instructions with information on the administration and dosage of the inventive lyophilized nucleic acid. Such kits, preferably kit of parts, may be applied, e.g., for any of the above mentioned applications or uses. The kit may optionally contain technical instructions with information on the administration and dosage of the lyophilized nucleic acid. As an example, the kit of parts may comprise in one or more parts of the kit at least one lyophilized nucleic acid as defined herein, and optionally in one or more parts of the kit further additives as defined herein, and in one or more parts of the kit water or a buffer as defined herein, and optionally technical instructions with information on the administration and dosage of the lyophilized nucleic acid. 
Figures: 
The following Figures are intended to illustrate the invention further. They are not intended to limit the subject matter of the invention thereto. 
Figure 1 : shows the dependency of the relative integrity of mRNA in different solutions stored at 37[deg.]C for 0 to 8 weeks, particularly when solved in water for injection (WFI), when solved in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution and lyophilized or when solved in WFI and lyophilized. As can be seen in Figure 1 , mRNA obtained by lyophilization of mRNA solved in 80% (w/w) Ringer-
Lactate solution exhibits a significantly better median relative integrity of &gt; 70% (w/w) within a period of 8 weeks. In comparison, mRNA solved in WFI exhibits a significant degradation and decrease of median relative integrity at a temperature of 37[deg.]C within 3 weeks and mRNA solved in WFI and lyophilized exhibits a significant degradation and decrease of median relative integrity at a temperature of 37[deg.]C already within 2 weeks. 
Figure 2: displays the dependency of the relative integrity of mRNA coding for prostate specific antigen (PSA/KLK3 mRNA) in different solutions stored at 60[deg.]C for 0 or 5 weeks, particularly when solved and lyophilized in 80% (w/w) Ringer- 
Lactate solution, when solved and lyophilized in water for injection (WFI), or when solved and lyophilized in a salt solution containing 5 mM K, 130 mM Na, 2 mM Ca, 2 mM Mg). As can be seen in Figure 2, mRNA obtained by lyophilization of mRNA solved in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution exhibits a significantly better median relative integrity of &gt; 70% within a period of at least 4 weeks. In comparison, mRNA obtained by lyophilization of mRNA solved in WFI exhibits a significant degradation and decrease of median relative integrity at a temperature of 60[deg.]C already within 3 weeks and mRNA obtained by lyophilization of mRNA solved in the above salt solution exhibits a significant degradation and decrease of median relative integrity at a temperature of 60[deg.]C already within 1 week. Use of a salt solution alone containing alkali and earth-alkali salts alone thus shows the expected degradation. Use of salts of lactic acid (Ringer's lactate), however, shows a surprisingly good increase in long-term storage capabilities. 
Figure 3: shows the relative integrity of mRNA lyophilized from sodium lactate containing solutions at 37[deg.]C within a period of 3 weeks, particularly when solved and lyophilized in water for injection (WFI), when solved and lyophilized in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution (22 mM sodium lactate), when solved and lyophilized in 30 mM sodium lactate or when solved and lyophilized in 3 mM sodium lactate. As can be seen in Figure 3 the stabilizing effect clearly results from use of lactate for lyophilization compared to use of WFI for lyophilization. Free mRNA lyophilized from different sodium lactate containing solutions or buffers, such as Ringer- Lactate, showed nearly the same effect. 
Figure 4: illustrates the in vivo expression of freshly prepared luciferase encoded by mRNA versus in vivo expression of luciferase encoded by lyophilized mRNA after storage of 8 weeks, wherein the lyophilized mRNA was lyophilized in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution and stored for 8 weeks at 37[deg.]C. As can be seen in Figure 4, the storage of mRNA lyophilized in 80% (w/w) Ringer- Lactate solution does not exhibit a negative effect on the biological activity of the mRNA. The expression levels remain constant and does not show any significant difference with respect to freshly thawn mRNA in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution. 
Figure 5: shows the relative integrity of lyophilizates from different salt containing injection solutions stored at room temperature: The results show an enhanced stability of mRNA coding for prostate specific antigen PSA (KLK3 mRNA) lyophilized from lactate containing buffer (80% (w/w) Ringer's lactate (RiLa)) in contrast to lyophilisates from other buffers and injection solutions (200 mM sodium acetat at pH 5.5 (Acetate), 100 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.4 (Phosphate), 80 mM HEPES (2-(4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1 - piperazinyO-ethansulfonsaure) at pH7.4 (HEPES), PBS (phosphate buffered saline) at pH 7.4 (PBS), 100 mM Tris (Tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethan) at pH 7.4 (TRIS), 100mM Ammonium chloride at pH 8.5) (Ammonium). 
Figure 6: shows the relative integrity of mRNA lyophilized from a glucose-containing solution at 60[deg.]C for 0 to 33 days (d). As can be seen, the relative integrity of mRNA coding for prostate specific antigen PSA (KLK3 mRNA) lyophilzed in a glucose containing solution stored at 60[deg.]C for 0 to 33 days (d) significantly decreases below 70% already at day 21 , i.e. 3 weeks. Figure 7: shows the tumour growth after immunization with mRNA complexed with protamine in a solution containing ringer lactate (middle curve (from top to bottom)) or from the lyophilized version from the same solution (lowest curve (from top to bottom)) within 29 days. The highest curve (from top to bottom) represents the vaccination with Ringer lactate buffer without mRNA as control (the curve is also represented by triangles). 
Figure 8: shows the mRNA sequence encoding Photinus pyralis luciferase (SEQ ID 
 NO: 1 ) in the mRNA construct pCV19-Pp luc(GC)-muag-A70-C30; which exhibits a length of 1857 nucleotides. The mRNA sequence contains following sequence elements: 
 - the coding sequence encoding Photinus pyralis luciferase; 
- stabilizing sequences derived from alpha-globin-3'-UTR (muag (mutated alpha-globin-3'-UTR));

Examples: 
The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention further. They are not intended to limit the subject matter of the invention thereto. 
Example 1 - Preparation of plasmids 
 For the present examples DNA sequences, encoding Photinus pyralis luciferase, as well as DNA sequences, encoding human prostate antigen KLK3/PSA, were prepared and used for subsequent in vitro transcription reactions and stability studies. 
According to a first preparation, the DNA sequence corresponding to pCVl 9-Ppluc(GQ- muag-A70-C30 was prepared, which encodes the Photinus pyralis luciferase. The DNA constructs were prepared by modifying the wild type Photinus pyralis luciferase encoding DNA sequence by introducing a GC-optimized sequence for a better codon usage and stabilization, stabilizing sequences derived from alpha-globin-3'-UTR (muag (mutated alpha-globin-3'-UTR)), a stretch of 70 &lt;[chi]&gt; adenosine at the 3'-terminal end (poly-A-tail) and a stretch of 30 x cytosine at the 3'- terminal end (poly-C-tail) corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1 (see Figure 8). The sequence of the final DNA construct had a length of 1857 nucleotides. The corresponding mRNA sequence was termed "pCV19-Ppluc(GC)-muag-A70-C30" (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) (see Figure 8). 
According to a second preparation, the DNA sequence corresponding to pCV19- HsKLK3(GC)-muag-A70C30 DNA was prepared, encoding human prostate antigen KLK3/PSA. Therefore, a basic DNA construct was prepared termed pCV19-HsKLK3(GQ- muag-A70C30 by introducing into the underlying wild type sequence construct stabilizing sequences derived from alpha-globin-3'-UTR (muag (mutated alpha-globin-3'-UTR)), a stretch of 70 x adenosine at the 3'-terminal end (poly-A-tail) and a stretch of 30 x cytosine at the 3'- terminal end (poly-C-tail), leading to a sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 2 (see Figure 9). The corresponding mRNA sequence was termed pCVl 9-HsKLK3(GC)-muag- A70C30 (SEQ ID NO: 2) (see Figure 9). 
Both sequences contain following sequence elements: - the coding sequence encoding Photinus pyralis luciferase (SEQ ID NO: 
 1 ) or human prostate antigen KLK3/PSA (SEQ ID NO: 2); 
- stabilizing sequences derived from alpha-globin-3'-UTR (muag (mutated alpha-globin-3'-UTR)); 
 . 70 x adenosine at the 3'-terminal end (poly-A-tail); 
 - 30 x cytosine at the 3'- terminal end (poly-C-tail). 
Example 2 - In vitro transcription: 
 The respective DNA plasmids prepared according to Example 1 were transcribed in vitro using T7-Polymerase (T7-Opti mRNA Kit, CureVac, Tubingen, Germany) following the manufactures instructions. Subsequently the mRNA was purified using PureMessenger&lt;(R)&gt; (CureVac, Tubingen, Germany). 
Example 3 - Lyophylisation: 
The PureMessenger&lt;(R)&gt; purified and precipitated mRNA obtained according to Example 1 coding for prostate specific antigen PSA (KLK3 mRNA) or Photinus pyralis luciferase (Luc mRNA) were prepared for transfection (see Example 2) and expression purposes and for stability tests either as free mRNA or as complexed mRNA. Free mRNA: 
 The PureMessenger&lt;(R)&gt; purified and precipitated mRNA obtained according to Example 1 coding for prostate specific antigen PSA (KLK3 mRNA) or Photinus pyralis luciferase (Luc mRNA) was dissolved in water for injection (WFI) to 5 g/l. Subsequently the mRNA was diluted with WFI (water for injection), Ringer's lactate (80% (w/w) Ringer's lactate: 104,8 ttiM Na&lt;+&gt;; 4,29 mM K&lt;+&gt;; 1 ,47 mM Ca&lt;2+&gt;; 22,64 mM Lactate; wherein Ringer's lactate (100% (w/w)) comprises 131 mM Na&lt;+&gt;, 5,36 mM K&lt;+&gt;, 1 ,84 mM Ca&lt;2+&gt;, and 28,3 mM Lactate) sodium lactate solutions (3 mM and 30 mM sodium lactate), 200 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5, 100mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 80mM HEPES (2-(4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1 -piperazinyl)- ethansulfonic acid) pH 7.4, PBS (phosphate buffered saline) pH7.4, 100mM Tris (Tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethan) pH 7.4, 100mM Ammonium chloride pH 8.5, salt solution (5mM K&lt;+&gt;, 130mM Na&lt;+&gt;, 2mM Ca&lt;2+&gt;, 2mM Mg&lt;2+&gt;) or a Glucose-containing buffer (5% (w/w) Glucose in WFI) to a concentration of 0.1 g/l RNA. Aliquots of these solutions were lyophilized (Controls were frozen in liquid nitrogen or kept in solution). The locked cups were stored for the indicated time at room temperature, at 37[deg.]C or at 60[deg.]C. The resuspension was conducted with WFI. 
Complexed mRNA: 
The PureMessenger&lt;(R)&gt; purified and precipitated mRNA coding for prostate specific antigen PSA (KLK3 mRNA) or Photinus pyralis luciferase (Luc mRNA) was dissolved in water (WFI) to 5 g/l. Subsequently the mRNA was diluted with WFI, Ringer's lactate (80% (w/w) Ringer's lactate) or salt solution (5mM K&lt;+&gt;, 130mM Na&lt;+&gt;, 2mM Ca&lt;2+&gt;, 2mM Mg&lt;2&gt;) to a concentration of 0.4 g/l and (optionally) mixed with protamine in a ratio of 4:1 RNA/Protamine (w/w) and stored for the indicated time at room temperature, at 37[deg.]C or at 60[deg.]C. The resuspension was conducted with WFI. 
Gel electrophoresis: 
 1 pg RNA was loaded on an agarose gel and analyzed by the Biolmager and the software Launch VisionWorks LS (UVP LLC, Upland Canada). 
Example 4 - Transfection and expression of luciferase: 
 HeLa cells were trypsinized and washed in opti-MEM. 1 x10&lt;5&gt; cells per sample were electroporated with 3 pg of Luc mRNA. The transcripts were either (A) 3 aliquotes of 8 week stored or (B) of freshly prepared mRNA. Electroporated cells were seeded in 24-well plates in 1 ml complete medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 100 units/ml each of Penicillin and Streptomycin, 10 mM L-Glutamin). The transfection solution was sucked off 24h after transfection and the cells were lysed in 200 [mu][Iota] lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-P04, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 % Triton-X 100, 2 mM DTT). The supernatants were then mixed with luciferin buffer (25 mM Glycylglycin, 15 mM MgS04, 5 mM ATP, 62,5 [mu][Mu] luciferin) and luminiscence was detected using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507 (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany)). 
The results of these experiments are shown in Figures 1 to 6. 
According to a first experiment the dependency of the relative integrity of mRNA in different solutions stored at 37[deg.]C for 0 to 8 weeks were investigated, particularly when solved in water for injection (WFI), when solved in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution and lyophilized or when solved in WFI and lyophilized. As can be seen in Figure 1 , mRNA obtained by lyophilization of mRNA solved in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution exhibits a significantly better median relative integrity of &gt; 70% within a period of 8 weeks. In comparison, mRNA solved in WFI exhibits a significant degradation and decrease of median relative integrity at a temperature of 37[deg.]C within 3 weeks and mRNA solved in WFI and lyophilized exhibits a significant degradation and decrease of median relative integrity at a temperature of 37[deg.]C already within 2 weeks. 
According to a second experiment the dependency of the relative integrity of mRNA coding for prostate specific antigen (PSA/KLK3 mRNA) in different solutions stored at 60[deg.]C for 0 or 5 weeks was investigated, particularly when solved and lyophilized in 80% (w/w) Ringer- Lactate solution, when solved and lyophilized in water for injection (WFI), or when solved and lyophilized in a salt solution containing 5 mM K, 130 mM Na, 2 mM Ca, 2 mM Mg). As can be seen in Figure 2, mRNA obtained by lyophilization of mRNA solved in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution exhibits a significantly better median relative integrity of &gt; 70% within a period of at least 4 weeks. In comparison, mRNA obtained by lyophilization of mRNA solved in WFI exhibits a significant degradation and decrease of median relative integrity at a temperature of 60[deg.]C already within 3 weeks and mRNA obtained by lyophilization of mRNA solved in the above salt solution exhibits a significant degradation and decrease of median relative integrity at a temperature of 60[deg.]C already within 1 week. Use of a salt solution alone containing alkali and earth-alkali salts alone thus shows the expected degradation. Use of salts of lactic acid (Ringer's lactate), however, shows a surprisingly good increase in long-term storage capabilities. According to a further experiment the relative integrity of mRNA lyophilized from sodium lactate containing solutions at 37[deg.]C within a period of 3 weeks was investigated, particularly when solved and lyophilized in water for injection (WFI), when solved and lyophilized in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution (22 mM sodium lactate), when solved and lyophilized in 30 mM sodium lactate or when solved and lyophilized in 3 mM sodium lactate. As can be seen in Figure 3 the stabilizing effect clearly results from use of lactate for lyophilization compared to use of WFI for lyophilization. Free mRNA lyophilized from different sodium lactate containing solutions or buffers, such as Ringer-Lactate, showed nearly the same effect. According to a fourth experiment illustrates the in vitro expression (in HeLa cells) of freshly prepared luciferase encoded by mRNA versus in vitro expression of luciferase encoded by lyophilized mRNA after storage of 8 weeks was determined, wherein the lyophilized mRNA was lyophilized in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution and stored for 8 weeks at 37[deg.]C. As can be seen in Figure 4, the storage of mRNA lyophilized in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution does not exhibit a negative effect on the biological activity of the mRNA. The expression levels remain constant and does not show any significant difference with respect to freshly thawn mRNA in 80% (w/w) Ringer-Lactate solution. 
According to another experiment the relative integrity of lyophilizates from different salt containing injection solutions stored at room temperature were investigated. The results are shown in Figure 5. They show an enhanced stability of mRNA coding for prostate specific antigen PSA (KLK3 mRNA) lyophilized from lactate containing buffer (80% (w/w) Ringer's lactate (RiLa)) in contrast to lyophilisates from other buffers and injection solutions (200 mM sodium acetat at pH 5.5 (Acetate), 100 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.4 (Phosphate), 80 mM HEPES (2-(4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1 -piperazinyD-ethansulfonsaure) at pH7.4 (HEPES), PBS (phosphate buffered saline) at pH 7.4 (PBS), 100 mM Tris (Tris(hydroxymethyl)- aminomethan) at pH 7.4 (TRIS), 100mM Ammonium chloride at pH 8.5) (Ammonium). 
According to a last experiment the relative integrity of mRNA lyophilized from a glucose- containing solution at 60[deg.]C for 0 to 33 days (d) was determined. The results are shown in Figure 6. As can be seen, the relative integrity of mRNA coding for prostate specific antigen PSA (KLK3 mRNA) lyophilzed in a glucose containing solution stored at 60[deg.]C for 0 to 33 days (d) significantly decreases below 70% already at day 21 , i.e. 3 weeks. 
Example 5: Tumor challenge using mRNA coding for ovalbumine 
 For the present experiment, mRNA coding for ovalbumine was complexed with protamine in the following protocol. RNA was mixed in a ratio of 4:1 RNA/Protamine solution (w/w) with a diluted protamine solution containing protamine, WFI and Ringer lactate were added to a final RNA concentration of 0.8 g/l and 80% (w/w) Ringer lactate. The formulations were aiiquoted into borosilicate glas typ I and half of the samples were frozen by liquid nitrogen for at least 5 min and lyophilized at 0.055 mbar for 22 h. Sample plates were kept at room temperature for 1 7 h and were than elevated to 35[deg.]C for another 5 h. The chamber was floatet with dry argon and the samples were closed under this atmosphere by a bromobutyl stopper. The lyophilized and non-lyophilized samples were stored in an exsiccator at 4-8[deg.]C and were dissolved in WFI prior to use (Prime 7 d / Boost 1 5 d after drying). Prior to use the samples were controlled for relative integrity by agarose gel chromatography and complex size by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). 
For tumor challenge experiments, 7 week old C57BIJ6 mice were vaccinated with 2 cycles (Prime day 1 / Boost day 9) of intradermal injections of 80 [mu][Iota] formulations or the lyophilized RNA and the and non-lyophi lized RNA. As a negative control 80 [mu][Iota] 80% Ringer lactate without any RNA were injected. At day 1 5 1 x1 0&lt;6&gt; E.G7-OVA cells per mice were implanted subcutaneously. Tumour size was measured in 3 dimensions using a calliper. 
The surprising results are shown in Figure 7. Figure 7 shows the tumour growth after immunization with mRNA complexed with protamine in a solution containing ringer lactate (middle curve (from top to bottom)) or from the lyophilized version from the same solution (lowest curve (from top to bottom)) within 29 days. The highest curve (from top to bottom) represents the vaccination with Ringer lactate buffer without mRNA as control (the curve is also represented by triangles). It is very surpring that lyophilized and subsequently resonstituted mRNA is more effective preventing tumor growth than the sample without the prior step of lyophilization. Since all RNAs were controlled regarding particle size and integrity it is guaranteed that all RNAs were completely intact. This is a surprising and not obvious advantage of the present invention over the prior art.</p></description></fulltext-document>
