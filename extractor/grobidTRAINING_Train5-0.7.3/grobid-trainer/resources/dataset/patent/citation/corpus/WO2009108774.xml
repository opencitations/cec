STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH 
[0002] This invention was made with government support under Grant No. EEC-0540879 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention. 
BACKGROUND 
[0003] Biosynthetic pathways are engineered to produce high yields of desired products. Engineered biosynthetic pathways employ multiple enzymes, often heterologous to the expression host. The enzymes often produce metabolites foreign to the host, thus resulting in side effects such as flux imbalances, toxicity from metabolite intermediates, and/or a burden from protein overexpression. Protein expression levels may be modulated via plasmid copy numbers and promoter strengths. However, combinatorial titration of individual enzyme expression levels is experimentally tedious, especially for multi-enzyme pathways. 
[0004] There is a need in the art for efficient methods of producing products of biosynthetic pathways.

DEFINITIONS 
[0020] The terms "nucleic acid," used herein, refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides. Thus, this term includes, but is not limited to, single-, double-, or multi-stranded DNA or RNA, genomic DNA, cDNA, DNA-RNA hybrids, or a polymer comprising purine and pyrimidine bases or other natural, chemically or biochemically modified, non- natural, or derivatized nucleotide bases. 
[0021] The terms "peptide," "polypeptide," and "protein" are used interchangeably herein, and refer to a polymeric form of amino acids of any length, which can include coded and non-coded amino acids, chemically or biochemically modified or derivatized amino acids, and polypeptides having modified peptide backbones. 
[0022] The term "heterologous," as used herein in the context of a genetically modified host cell, refers to a polypeptide wherein at least one of the following is true: (a) the polypeptide is foreign ("exogenous") to (i.e., not naturally found in) the host cell; (b) the polypeptide is naturally found in (e.g., is "endogenous to") a given host microorganism or host cell but is either produced in an unnatural (e.g., greater than expected or greater than naturally found) amount in the cell, or differs in nucleotide sequence from the endogenous nucleotide sequence such that the same encoded protein (having the same or substantially the same amino acid sequence) as found endogenously is produced in an unnatural (e.g., greater than expected or greater than naturally found) amount in the cell. 
[0023] The term "heterologous," as used herein in the context of a chimeric polypeptide, refers to two components that are defined by structures derived from different sources. For example, where "heterologous" is used in the context of a chimeric polypeptide (e.g., a chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme), the chimeric polypeptide includes operably linked amino acid sequences that can be derived from different polypeptides (e.g., a first amino acid sequence from a biosynthetic pathway enzyme; and a second amino acid sequence that is not normally found associated with the biosynthetic pathway enzyme in nature, e.g., a peptide that binds a peptide binding element such as a PDZ domain, a GBD, an SH3 domain, etc.). Similarly, "heterologous" in the context of a polynucleotide encoding a chimeric polypeptide includes operably linked nucleotide sequences that can be derived from different coding regions (e.g., a first nucleotide sequence encoding a biosynthetic pathway enzyme; and a second nucleotide sequence encoding a peptide that is not normally found associated with the biosynthetic pathway enzyme in nature, e.g., a peptide that binds a peptide binding element such as a PDZ domain, a GBD, an SH3 domain, etc.). Other exemplary "heterologous" nucleic acids include expression constructs in which a nucleic acid comprising a coding sequence is operably linked to a regulatory element (e.g., a promoter) that is not normally associated with the coding sequence (e.g., to provide for expression in a host cell of interest, to provide for higher or lower levels of the encoded protein, etc.). For example, a T7 promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide encoding a chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme is said to be heterologous to the coding sequence for the chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme. 
[0024] "Recombinant," as used herein, means that a particular nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) is the product of various combinations of cloning, restriction, and/or ligation steps resulting in a construct having a structural coding or non-coding sequence distinguishable from endogenous nucleic acids found in natural systems. Generally, DNA sequences encoding the structural coding sequence can be assembled from cDNA fragments and short oligonucleotide linkers, or from a series of synthetic oligonucleotides, to provide a synthetic nucleic acid which is capable of being expressed from a recombinant transcriptional unit contained in a cell or in a cell-free transcription and translation system. Such sequences can be provided in the form of an open reading frame uninterrupted by internal non- translated sequences, or introns, which are typically present in eukaryotic genes. Genomic DNA comprising the relevant sequences can also be used in the formation of a recombinant gene or transcriptional unit. Sequences of non-translated DNA may be present 5' or 3' from the open reading frame, where such sequences do not interfere with manipulation or expression of the coding regions, and may indeed act to modulate production of a desired product by various mechanisms (see "DNA regulatory sequences", below). 
[0025] Thus, e.g., the term "recombinant" polynucleotide or "recombinant" nucleic acid refers to one which is not naturally occurring, e.g., is made by the artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of sequence through human intervention. This artificial combination is often accomplished by either chemical synthesis means, or by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids, e.g., by genetic engineering techniques. Such is usually done to replace a codon with a redundant codon encoding the same or a conservative amino acid, while typically introducing or removing a sequence recognition site. Alternatively, it is performed to join together nucleic acid segments of desired functions to generate a desired combination of functions. This artificial combination is often accomplished by either chemical synthesis means, or by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids, e.g., by genetic engineering techniques. 
[0026] Similarly, the term "recombinant" polypeptide refers to a polypeptide which is not naturally occurring, e.g., is made by the artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of amino sequence through human intervention. Thus, e.g., a polypeptide that comprises a heterologous amino acid sequence is recombinant. 
[0027] A "host cell," as used herein, denotes an in vivo or in vitro eukaryotic cell, a prokaryotic cell, or a cell from a multicellular organism (e.g., a cell line) cultured as a unicellular entity, which eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells can be, or have been, used as recipients for a nucleic acid (e.g., an expression vector that comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding one or more biosynthetic pathway gene products such as mevalonate pathway gene products), and include the progeny of the original cell which has been genetically modified by the nucleic acid. It is understood that the progeny of a single cell may not necessarily be completely identical in morphology or in genomic or total DNA complement as the original parent, due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation. A "genetically modified host cell" (also referred to as a "recombinant host cell") is a host cell into which has been introduced a heterologous nucleic acid, e.g., an expression vector. For example, a prokaryotic host cell is a genetically modified prokaryotic host cell (e.g., a bacterium), by virtue of introduction into a suitable prokaryotic host cell of a heterologous nucleic acid, e.g., an exogenous nucleic acid that is foreign to (not normally found in nature in) the prokaryotic host cell, or a recombinant nucleic acid that is not normally found in the prokaryotic host cell; and a eukaryotic host cell is a genetically modified eukaryotic host cell, by virtue of introduction into a suitable eukaryotic host cell of a heterologous nucleic acid, e.g., an exogenous nucleic acid that is foreign to the eukaryotic host cell, or a recombinant nucleic acid that is not normally found in the eukaryotic host cell. 
[0028] The terms "isoprenoid," "isoprenoid compound," "terpene," "terpene compound," "terpenoid," and "terpenoid compound" are used interchangeably herein, and refer to any compound that is capable of being derived from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). The number of C-atoms present in the isoprenoids is typically evenly divisible by five (e.g., C5, ClO, C15, C20, C25, C30 and C40). Irregular isoprenoids and polyterpenes have been reported, and are also included in the definition of "isoprenoid." Isoprenoid compounds include, but are not limited to, monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and polyterpenes. 
[0029] As used herein, the term "prenyl diphosphate" is used interchangeably with "prenyl pyrophosphate," and includes monoprenyl diphosphates having a single prenyl group (e.g., IPP and DMAPP), as well as polyprenyl diphosphates that include 2 or more prenyl groups. Monoprenyl diphosphates include isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). 
[0030] As used herein, the term "terpene synthase" refers to any enzyme that enzymatically modifies 
IPP, DMAPP, or a polyprenyl pyrophosphate, such that a terpenoid precursor compound is produced. The term "terpene synthase" includes enzymes that catalyze the conversion of a prenyl diphosphate into an isoprenoid or isoprenoid precursor. 
[0031] The word "pyrophosphate" is used interchangeably herein with "diphosphate." Thus, e.g., the terms "prenyl diphosphate" and "prenyl pyrophosphate" are interchangeable; the terms "isopentenyl pyrophosphate" and "isopentenyl diphosphate" are interchangeable; the terms farnesyl diphosphate" and farnesyl pyrophosphate" are interchangeable; etc. 
[0032] The term "mevalonate pathway" or "MEV pathway" is used herein to refer to the biosynthetic pathway that converts acetyl-CoA to IPP. The mevalonate pathway comprises enzymes that catalyze the following steps: (a) condensing two molecules of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA (e.g., by action of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase); (b) condensing acetoacetyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA to form hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoenzymeA (HMG-CoA) (e.g., by action of HMG-CoA synthase (HMGS)); (c) converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate (e.g., by action of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR)); (d) phosphorylating mevalonate to mevalonate 5-phosphate (e.g., by action of mevalonate kinase (MK)); (e) converting mevalonate 5-phosphate to mevalonate 5-pyrophosphate (e.g., by action of phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK)); and (f) converting mevalonate 5-pyrophosphate to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (e.g., by action of mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase (MPD)). The mevalonate pathway is illustrated schematically in Figure 7. The "top half of the mevalonate pathway refers to the enzymes responsible for the conversion of acetyl-CoA to mevalonate. [0033] The term "1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-diphosphate pathway" or "DXP pathway" is used herein to refer to the pathway that converts glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate to IPP and DMAPP through a DXP pathway intermediate, where DXP pathway comprises enzymes that catalyze the reactions depicted schematically in Figure 8. Dxs is 1-deoxy-D-xylulose -5-phosphate synthase; Dxr is l-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (also known as IspC); IspD is 4-diphosphocytidyl- 2C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase; IspE is 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase; IspF is 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; IspG is l-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl A- diphosphate synthase (IspG); and ispH is isopentenyl/dimethylallyl diphosphate synthase. 
[0034] As used herein, the term "prenyl transferase" is used interchangeably with the terms "isoprenyl diphosphate synthase" and "polyprenyl synthase" (e.g., "GPP synthase," "FPP synthase," "OPP synthase," etc.) to refer to an enzyme that catalyzes the consecutive V-A condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with allylic primer substrates, resulting in the formation of prenyl diphosphates of various chain lengths.

It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the appended claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
[0040] The present invention provides methods of producing a product or product precursor of a biosynthetic pathway in a genetically modified host cell. The present invention also provides genetically modified host cells comprising nucleic acids encoding a scaffold polypeptide and nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences encoding two or more enzymes in a biosynthetic pathway. The present invention further provides nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences encoding scaffold polypeptides, for use in a subject method. METHODS OF PRODUCING A PRODUCT OR PRODUCT PRECURSOR OF A BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY 
[0041] The present invention provides methods of producing a product or product precursor of a biosynthetic pathway in a genetically modified host cell. The methods generally involve culturing a genetically modified host cell under suitable conditions, wherein the genetically modified host cell comprises: a) a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold polypeptide comprising at least two different peptide binding elements; and b) one or more nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences encoding two or more enzymes in a biosynthetic pathway, where the biosynthetic pathway enzymes are chimeric, e.g., a chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme comprises a heterologous peptide that binds to a peptide binding element in the scaffold polypeptide. A given peptide binding element binds a particular heterologous peptide present within a chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme, thereby providing for association of the chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes with the scaffold polypeptide. The association of the chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes with the scaffold polypeptide is of sufficient affinity that the chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes are immobilized on the scaffold polypeptide. Biosynthetic pathway enzymes that are "adjacent to" one another in a biosynthetic pathway, i.e., that act on a product of an immediately preceding enzyme in the pathway, or that product a product that is a substrate for an immediately downstream enzyme in the pathway, are immobilized spatially relative to one another in the same order as they act in a biosynthetic pathway. The cells are cultured such that a substrate for the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway is present in the cell; the biosynthetic pathway enzymes are synthesized in the cell and convert the substrate into a product. [0042] Use of a scaffold polypeptide to immobilize biosynthetic pathway enzymes provides for one or more of the following: 1) increased efficiency of pathway flux; 2) optimized metabolic flux through the pathway; 3) reduced metabolic burden on the host cell; and 4) reduced concentration of potentially toxic free intermediates in the cytosol/cytoplasm. Balance of enzyme activity levels is achieved through use of a scaffold polypeptide. For example, the copy number of an enzyme having lower activity that is recruited to a scaffold can be higher than the copy number of an enzyme having higher activity. This can be advantageous, e.g., where the lower activity enzyme catalyzes a rate-limiting step in the pathway. Use of a scaffold polypeptide increases efficiency and optimizes pathway flux; because of increased efficiency and optimized flux, equivalent or higher yields of product can be achieved with lower levels of enzyme. Lower levels of enzyme production in a host cell are advantageous, as it places less of a metabolic burden on the host cell. Because the turnover of biosynthetic pathway intermediates is more efficient with use of a scaffold polypeptide, the amount/concentration of pathway intermediates free in the cytosol or cytoplasm is reduced. Reduced levels of free pathway intermediates are advantageous where such intermediates are toxic to the host cell. 
[0043] Co-localization of a first enzyme and a second enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway can also be achieved by incorporating into the first and second enzymes heterologous binding elements that bind to one another and thereby bring the enzymes into spatial proximity. Heterologous binding elements include a "heterologous peptide" and a "peptide binding element," where a "heterologous peptide" is a ligand for a "peptide binding element." Thus, e.g., a first biosynthetic pathway enzyme can comprise a first heterologous binding element (e.g., a peptide binding element, as described below), and a second biosynthetic pathway enzyme can comprise a second heterologous binding element (e.g., a heterologous peptide, as described below), where the second heterologous binding element is a ligand for the first binding element, where the first enzyme produces a product that is a substrate for the second enzyme, and where binding of the first heterologous binding element to the second heterologous binding element brings the first and second enzymes into spatial proximity to one another. 
[0044] In some embodiments, at least a first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme and a second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme are immobilized onto a scaffold polypeptide. The first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme produces a first product that is a substrate for the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme. The second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme is immobilized onto the scaffold polypeptide such that it is positioned adjacent to or very close to the first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme. In this way, the effective concentration of the first product is high, and the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme can act efficiently on the first product. As an example, a scaffold polypeptide has immobilized thereon, in order from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus of the scaffold polypeptide: a) the first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; and b) the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme. 
[0045] Two or more copies (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten, or more, molecules) of each enzyme can be immobilized onto the scaffold polypeptide. For example, in some embodiments, a scaffold polypeptide has immobilized thereon, in order from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus of the scaffold polypeptide: a) one molecule (copy) of the first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; and b) one molecule of the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme. In other embodiments, a scaffold polypeptide has immobilized thereon, in order from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus of the scaffold polypeptide: a) one molecule of the first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; and b) two or more molecules (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, or more, molecules) of the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme. 
[0046] Two or more molecules (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten, or more, molecules) of each enzyme can be immobilized onto the scaffold polypeptide. In this way, the ratio of any given enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway to any other enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway can be varied. For example, the ratio of a first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme to a second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme can be varied. For example, the ratio of a first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme to a second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme can be varied from about 0.1 : 10 to about 10:0.1, e.g., from about 0.1 :10 to about 0.5: 10, from about 0.5: 10 to about 1.0: 10, from about 1.0:10 to about 2: 10, from about 2:10 to about 5: 10, from about 5: 10 to about 7: 10, from about 7: 10 to about 10:10, from about 10:7 to about 10:5, from about 10:5 to about 10:2, from about 10:2 to about 10:1, from about 10:1 to about 10:0.5, or from about 10:0.5 to about 10:1. The ratio of a first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme to a second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme can be varied from about 1 :5 to about 5: 1, e.g., from about 1 :5 to about 2:5, from about 2:5 to about 3:5, from about 3:5 to about 5:5, from about 5:5 to about 5:3, from about 5:3 to about 5:2, or from about 5:2 to about 5: 1. 
[0047] In some embodiments, at least three chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes are immobilized onto a scaffold polypeptide. The first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme produces a first product that is a substrate for the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme, and the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme produces a second product that is a substrate for the third chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme. In these embodiments, a scaffold polypeptide has immobilized thereon, in order from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus of the scaffold polypeptide: a) the first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; b) the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; and c) the third biosynthetic pathway enzyme. 
[0048] In some embodiments, at least four chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes are immobilized onto a scaffold polypeptide. The first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme produces a first product that is a substrate for the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme, the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme produces a second product that is a substrate for the third chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme, and the third chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme produces a product that is a substrate for the fourth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme. In these embodiments, a scaffold polypeptide has immobilized thereon, in order from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus of the scaffold polypeptide: a) the first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; b) the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; c) the third chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; and d) the chimeric fourth biosynthetic pathway enzyme. 
[0049] In some embodiments, at least five chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes are immobilized onto a scaffold polypeptide. The first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme produces a first product that is a substrate for the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme, the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme produces a second product that is a substrate for the third chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme, the third chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme produces a product that is a substrate for the fourth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme, and the fourth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme produces a product that is a substrate for the fifth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme. In these embodiments, a scaffold polypeptide has immobilized thereon, in order from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus of the scaffold polypeptide: a) the first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; b) the second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; c) the third chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; d) the fourth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; and e) the fifth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme. It will be apparent from these examples that a sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, etc., biosynthetic pathway enzyme can be immobilized onto a scaffold polypeptide, that the enzymes are immobilized spatially in the order in which they function in a pathway, and that each enzyme can be immobilized onto the scaffold polypeptide in one two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or more copies (or molecules). Scaffold polypeptide 
[0050] A scaffold polypeptide is designed to organize biosynthetic pathway enzymes into a functional complex. A scaffold polypeptide comprises two or more peptide binding elements (PBEs). Binding of the PBE to a heterologous peptide (HP) present in a chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme provides for immobilization of enzyme on the scaffold polypeptide. Each PBE is capable of binding a corresponding HP present in a chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme. The binding between a PBE and HP is via protein-protein interaction. A given PBE can be immediately adjacent to another PBE, or can be separated from an adjacent PBE through a linker. The scaffold polypeptide can be introduced to a variety of different types of host cells, e.g., by introducing into a host cell a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding the scaffold polypeptide. 
[0051] A scaffold polypeptide comprises at least two different PBEs, thus binding at least two corresponding HPs in at least two different chimeric enzymes. A scaffold polypeptide can provide binding of 2 to 25 enzymes, thus immobilizing the enzymes on the scaffold. For example, a scaffold polypeptide can bind from 2 enzymes to 3 enzymes, from 3 enzymes to 6 enzymes, from 6 enzymes to 10 enzymes, from 10 enzymes to 15 enzymes, from 15 enzymes to 20 enzymes, or from 20 enzymes to 25 enzymes. 
[0052] A scaffold polypeptide has one, two or more copies of each PBE. For example, a scaffold polypeptide can have from 1 copy to 10 copies of each PBE, e.g., a scaffold polypeptide can comprise one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or more, copies of each PBE. Each PBE can independently be present in one or more copies. The copies can be in tandem, or separated by a linker. For example, a scaffold may comprise one copy of a first PBE (PBE1), two copies of PBE2, and three copies Of PBE3, where the copies are in tandem, or are separated by a linker. 
[0053] A scaffold polypeptide has a general formula of [(X)n(Y)Im! where each X is a different peptide binding element, wherein n is an integer from one to about 10 (e.g., where n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10), where Y, if present, is a linker peptide, and where m is an integer from 2 to about 50 (e.g., from 2 to about 3, from 3 to about 6, from 6 to about 10, from 10 to about 15, from 15 to 20, from 20 to 25, from 25 to 30, from 30 to 35, from 35 to 40, from 40 to 45, or from 45 to 50). 
[0054] For example, in some embodiments, a scaffold polypeptide has the formula 
(Xi)ni(Yi)(X2)n2(Y2)(X3)n3, where X1 is a first PBE that provides for binding of a first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; where X2 is a second PBE that provides for binding of a second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; where X3 is a third PBE that provides for binding of a third chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; where each of n1; n2, and n3 is independently an integer from one to about 10; and where each Y, if present, is a linker peptide. As another example, in some embodiments, a scaffold polypeptide has the formula (X1)n1(Y1)(X2)n2(Y2)(X3)n3(X4)n4(Y4)(X5)n5(Y5)(X6)n6, where X1 is a first PBE that provides for binding of a first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; where X2 is a second PBE that provides for binding of a second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; where X3 is a third PBE that provides for binding of a third chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; X4 is a fourth PBE that provides for binding of a fourth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; where X5 is a fifth PBE that provides for binding of a fifth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; where Xe is a sixth PBE that provides for binding of a sixth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme; where each of n1; n2, n3, n4, ns, and n[beta] is independently an integer from one to about 10; and where each Y, if present, is a linker peptide. 
[0055] In some embodiments, a scaffold polypeptide has the formula (Xi)(Yi)(X2)2(Y2)(X3)2(Y3), where X1 is a first PBE that provides for binding of a first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme and is present in one copy; where X2 is a second PBE that provides for binding of a second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme and is present in two copies; where X3 is a third PBE that provides for binding of a third chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme and is present in two copies; and where each Y, if present, is a linker peptide. In another example, in some embodiments, a scaffold polypeptide has the formula (X1)(Y1)(X2)2(Y2)(X3)4(Y3)(X4)(Y4)(X5)(Y5)(X6)(Y6), where X1 is a first PBE that provides for binding of a first chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme and present in one copy; where X2 is a second PBE that provides for binding of a second chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme and present in two copies; where X3 is a third PBE that provides for binding of a third chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme and present in four copies; X4 is a fourth PBE that provides for binding of a fourth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme and present in one copy; where X5 is a fifth PBE that provides for binding of a fifth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme and present in one copy; where Xe is a sixth PBE that provides for binding of a sixth chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme and present in one copy; and where each Y, if present, is a linker peptide. 
[0056] A PBE can have a length of from about 25 amino acids to about 200 amino acids - e.g., from about 25 amino acids to about 50 amino acids, from about 50 amino acids to about 60 amino acids, from about 60 amino acids about 75 amino acids, from about 75 amino acids to about 80 amino acids, from about 80 amino acids to about 90 amino acids, from about 90 amino acids to about 100 amino acids, from about 100 amino acids to about 125 amino acids, from about 125 amino acids to about 150 amino acids, from about 150 amino acids to about 175 amino acids, or from about 175 amino acids to about 200 amino acids. 
[0057] In some embodiments, the PBE does not naturally occur in the host cell so that only the engineered protein-protein interactions occur. 
[0058] In some embodiments, two adjacent PBEs are separated by a linker. Suitable linkers include peptides of between about 6 and about 40 amino acids in length, e.g., from about 6 amino acids to about 8 amino acids, from about 8 amino acids to about 10 amino acids, from about 10 amino acids to about 12 amino acids, from about 12 amino acids to about 15 amino acids, from about 15 amino acids to about 20 amino acids, from about 20 amino acids to about 25 amino acids, from about 25 amino acids to about 30 amino acids, from about 30 amino acids to about 35 amino acids, or from about 35 amino acids to about 40 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, a peptide linker has a degree of flexibility. The linking peptides can have virtually any amino acid sequence, bearing in mind that linkers will have a sequence that results in a generally flexible peptide. Small amino acids, such as glycine and alanine, are of use in creating a flexible peptide. The creation of such sequences is routine to those of skill in the art. A variety of different linkers are commercially available and are considered suitable for use according to the present invention. 
[0059] Amino acid sequences rich in alanine and proline residues are known to impart flexibility to multi-domain protein structures. For example, such sequences link the domains of the so-called E2 components of the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and 2-oxo glutarate dehydrogenase complex. Alanine-proline rich regions are also found in myosin light chains. Suitable linkers include peptides having multiple serine residues. Suitable linkers include peptides having multiple glycine residues. In some embodiments, a suitable linker includes peptides having multiple glycine and multiple serine residues, where exemplary linkers include, e.g., GSGSGSGGS (SEQ ID NO:2). Exemplary linkers have a combination of glycine, alanine, proline and methionine residues, such as AAAGGM (SEQ ID NO:3); AAAGGMPP AAAGGM (SEQ ID NO:4); AAAGGM (SEQ ID NO:5); and PPAAAGGMM (SEQ ID NO:6). However, any flexible linker generally between about 6 and about 40 amino acids in length may be used. Linkers may have virtually any sequence that results in a generally flexible peptide, including alanine-proline rich sequences of the type exemplified above. [0060] A PBE binds a corresponding HP in a chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzyme via protein- protein interaction. Examples of such PBEs include, but are not limited to, a src homology 2 (SH2) domain; a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain; a src homology 3 (SH3) domain; a GTPase Binding Domain (GBD); a leucine zipper domain; a forkhead associated (FHA) domain; a WW domain; a 14-3- 3 domain; a death domain; a caspase recruitment domain (CARD); a bromodomain; a chromatin organization modifier; a shadow chromo domain; an F-box domain; a HECT domain; a RING finger domain; a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain; a glycine-tyrosine-phenylalanine (GYF) domain; a soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) domain; a VHS domain; an ANK repeat; an armadillo repeat; a WD40 repeat; an MH2 domain; a calponin homology domain; a DbI homology domain; a gelsolin homology domain; a phox and Beml (PBl) domain; a SOCS box; an RGS domain; a ToML- 1 receptor domain; a tetratricopeptide repeat; a TRAF domain; a Bcl-2 homology domain; a PSD95/DlgA/Zo-l (PDZ) domain; a coiled-coil domain; a bZIP domain; and the like.

Where a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold polypeptide and the nucleotide sequences encoding two or more chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes are on the same nucleic acid, in some embodiments, the nucleotide sequences encoding two or more chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes are operably linked to a first transcriptional control element, and the nucleotide sequence encoding the scaffold polypeptide is operably linked to the first transcriptional control element. Where a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold polypeptide and the nucleotide sequences encoding two or more chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes are on the same nucleic acid, in some embodiments, the nucleotide sequences encoding two or more chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes are operably linked to a first transcriptional control element, and the nucleotide sequence encoding the scaffold polypeptide is operably linked to a second control element. In other embodiments, a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold polypeptide and the nucleotide sequences encoding two or more chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes are on separate nucleic acids. Expression constructs 
[0094] In some embodiments, a subject nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a subject scaffold polypeptide is present in an expression construct. Such an expression construct can, when introduced into a host cell, provide for production of the encoded scaffold polypeptide in the host cell. In some embodiments, a subject expression construct comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a subject scaffold polypeptide. In some embodiments, a subject expression construct comprises: 1) a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold polypeptide; and 2) nucleotide sequences encoding two or more chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes. Expression constructs generally include one or more transcriptional control elements, and a selectable marker. Transcriptional control elements 
[0095] Non-limiting examples of suitable eukaryotic promoters include CMV immediate early, HSV thymidine kinase, early and late SV40, LTRs from retrovirus, and mouse metallothionein-I. In some embodiments, e.g., for expression in a yeast cell, a suitable promoter is a constitutive promoter such as an ADHl promoter, a PGKl promoter, an ENO promoter, a PYKl promoter and the like; or a regulatable promoter such as a GALl promoter, a GALlO promoter, an ADH2 promoter, a PHO5 promoter, a CUPl promoter, a GAL7 promoter, a MET25 promoter, a MET3 promoter, a CYCl promoter, a HIS3 promoter, an ADHl promoter, a PGK promoter, a GAPDH promoter, an ADCl promoter, a TRPl promoter, a URA3 promoter, a LEU2 promoter, an ENO promoter, a TPl promoter, and AOXl (e.g., for use in Pichia). Selection of the appropriate vector and promoter is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art. The expression vector may also contain a ribosome binding site for translation initiation and a transcription terminator. The expression vector may also include appropriate sequences for amplifying expression. 
[0096] In some embodiments, the promoter is an inducible promoter. In some embodiments, the promoter is a constitutive promoter. In yeast, a number of vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters may be used.

(2002) J. Exp. Botany 53: 1891- 1897</bibl>), a glandular trichome-selective regulatory element, and the like.

Suitable strong promoters for use in prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli include, but are not limited to Trc, Tac, T5, T7, and PLambda Non-limiting examples of operators for use in bacterial host cells include a lactose promoter operator (Lad repressor protein changes conformation when contacted with lactose, thereby preventing the Lad repressor protein from binding to the operator), a tryptophan promoter operator (when complexed with tryptophan, TrpR repressor protein has a conformation that binds the operator; in the absence of tryptophan, the TrpR repressor protein has a conformation that does not bind to the operator), and a tac promoter operator (see, for example, <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">deBoer et al.

(1999) FEMS Microbiol Lett. 177(2):327-34</bibl>); and the like. Expression vectors 
[00102] Suitable expression vectors include any of a variety of expression vectors available in the art; and variant and derivatives of such vectors. Those of ordinary skill in the art are familiar with selecting appropriate expression vectors for a given application. Numerous suitable expression vectors are known to those of skill in the art, and many are commercially available. Suitable expression vectors for use in constructing the host cells include, but are not limited to, baculovirus vectors, bacteriophage vectors, plasmids, phagemids, cosmids, fosmids, bacterial artificial chromosomes, viral vectors (for example, viral vectors based on vaccinia virus, poliovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, SV40, herpes simplex virus, and the like), Pl-based artificial chromosomes, yeast plasmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, and other vectors. A typical expression vector contains an origin of replication that ensures propagation of the vector, a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a desired enzyme, and one or more regulatory elements that control the synthesis of the desired enzyme. 
[00103] Depending on the host/vector system utilized, any of a number of suitable transcription and translation control elements, including constitutive and inducible promoters, transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. may be used in the expression vector (see e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bitter et al. (1987) Methods in Enzymology, 153:516-544</bibl>). 
[00104] In some embodiments, an expression vector can be constructed to yield a desired level of copy numbers of the vector. In some embodiments, an expression vector provides for at least 10, between 10 to 20, between 20-50, between 50 and 100, or more than 100 copies of the expression vector in the host cell. Low copy number plasmids generally provide fewer than about 20 plasmid copies per cell; medium copy number plasmids generally provide from about 20 plasmid copies per cell to about 50 plasmid copies per cell, or from about 20 plasmid copies per cell to about 80 plasmid copies per cell; and high copy number plasmids generally provide from about 80 plasmid copies per cell to about 200 plasmid copies per cell, or more than 200 plasmid copies per cell. In some embodiments, the expression vector is a low copy number vector. 
[00105] Suitable low-copy (centromeric) expression vectors for yeast include, but are not limited to, pRS415 and pRS416 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sikorski &amp; Hieter (1989) Genetics 122: 19-27</bibl>). In some embodiments, the enzyme-encoding sequences are present on one or more medium copy number plasmids. Medium copy number plasmids generally provide from about 20 plasmid copies per cell to about 50 plasmid copies per cell, or from about 20 plasmid copies per cell to about 80 plasmid copies per cell. Medium copy number plasmids for use in yeast include, e.g., Yep24. In some embodiments, the enzyme-encoding sequences are present on one or more high copy number plasmids. High copy number plasmids generally provide from about 30 plasmid copies per cell to about 200 plasmid copies per cell, or more. Suitable high-copy 2 micron expression vectors in yeast include, but are not limited to, pRS420 series vectors, e.g., pRS425 and pRS426 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Christianson et al. (1992) Gene 110: 119-122</bibl>). 
[00106] Exemplary low copy expression vectors for use in prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli include, but are not limited to, pACYC184, pBeloBacl 1, pBR332, pBAD33, pBBRlMCS and its derivatives, pSClOl, SuperCos (cosmid), and pWE15 (cosmid). Suitable medium copy expression vectors for use in prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli include, but are not limited to pTrc99A, pBAD24, and vectors containing a CoIEl origin of replication and its derivatives. Suitable high copy number expression vectors for use in prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli include, but are not limited to, pUC, pBluescript, pGEM, and pTZ vectors. 
[00107] The expression vector can also contain one or more selectable marker genes that, upon expression, confer one or more phenotypic traits useful for selecting or otherwise identifying host cells that carry the expression vector. Non-limiting examples of suitable selectable markers for prokaryotic cells include resistance to an antibiotic such as tetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, carbenicillin, or kanamycin. [00108] In some embodiments, instead of antibiotic resistance as a selectable marker for the expression vector, a subject method will employ host cells that do not require the use of an antibiotic resistance conferring selectable marker to ensure plasmid (expression vector) maintenance. In these embodiments, the expression vector contains a plasmid maintenance system such as the 60-kb IncP (RK2) plasmid, optionally together with the RK2 plasmid replication and/or segregation system, to effect plasmid retention in the absence of antibiotic selection (see, for example, <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sia et al. (1995) J. Bacteriol. 177:2789-97</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Pansegrau et al. (1994) J. MoI. Biol. 239:623-63</bibl>). A suitable plasmid maintenance system for this purpose is encoded by the parDE operon of RK2, which codes for a stable toxin and an unstable antitoxin. The antitoxin can inhibit the lethal action of the toxin by direct protein-protein interaction. Cells that lose the expression vector that harbors the parDE operon are quickly deprived of the unstable antitoxin, resulting in the stable toxin then causing cell death. The RK2 plasmid replication system is encoded by the trfA gene, which codes for a DNA replication protein. The RK2 plasmid segregation system is encoded by the parCBA operon, which codes for proteins that function to resolve plasmid multimers that may arise from DNA replication. Biosynthetic pathway enzymes 
[00109] As noted above, in some embodiments, a subject nucleic acid comprises: 1) a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold polypeptide; and 2) nucleotide sequences encoding two or more enzymes in a biosynthetic pathway, where the enzymes are chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes comprising: a) a biosynthetic pathway enzyme; and b) a heterologous peptide that provides for binding to a binding element within the scaffold polypeptide. Suitable biosynthetic pathway enzymes include, but are not limited to, enzymes that form an isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway; enzymes that form an alkaloid biosynthetic pathway; enzymes that form a phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway; and enzymes that form a polyketide biosynthetic pathway.

Isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway enzymes are described in more detail below. 
[00111] In some embodiments, the nucleotide sequence encoding a biosynthetic pathway enzyme encodes a biosynthetic pathway enzyme that has from about 50% to about 55%, from about 55% to about 60%, from about 60% to about 65%, from about 65% to about 70%, from about 70% to about 75%, from about 75% to about 80%, from about 80% to about 85%, from about 85% to about 90%, or from about 90% to about 95% amino acid sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of a naturally- occurring biosynthetic pathway enzyme. In some embodiments, the encoded biosynthetic pathway enzyme comprises one or more modifications relative to a wild-type biosynthetic pathway enzyme. For example, in some embodiments, the encoded biosynthetic pathway enzyme will have a non-native (non- wild-type, or non-naturally occurring, or variant) amino acid sequence. In some embodiments, the encoded biosynthetic pathway enzyme will have one or more amino acid sequence modifications (deletions, additions, insertions, substitutions) that increase the level of activity of the biosynthetic pathway enzyme. Isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway enzymes 
[00112] In some embodiments, a subject nucleic acid comprises: 1) a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold polypeptide; and 2) nucleotide sequences encoding two or more enzymes in an isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, where the enzymes are chimeric biosynthetic pathway enzymes comprising: a) an isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway enzyme; and b) a heterologous peptide that provides for binding to a binding element within the scaffold polypeptide. The two or more isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway enzymes provide for production of an isoprenoid or an isoprenoid precursor (e.g., isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), mevalonate, etc). In some embodiments, the two or more isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway enzymes comprise mevalonate pathway enzymes. In other embodiments, the two or more isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway enzymes comprise DXP pathway enzymes. 
[00113] In some embodiments, nucleotide sequences encoding two or more enzymes in an isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway comprise nucleotide sequences encoding two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or more of: an acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, a hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS), a hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), a mevalonate kinase (MK), a phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), and a mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase (MPD), an isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) isomerase, a prenyl transferase, and a terpene synthase.

[00117] The coding sequence of any known MEV pathway enzyme may be altered in various ways known in the art to generate targeted changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded enzyme. The amino acid sequence of a variant MEV pathway enzyme will in some embodiments be substantially similar to the amino acid sequence of any known MEV pathway enzyme, i.e. will differ by at least one amino acid, and may differ by at least two, at least 5, at least 10, or at least 20 amino acids, but typically not more than about fifty amino acids. The sequence changes may be substitutions, insertions or deletions. For example, as described below, the nucleotide sequence can be altered for the codon bias of a particular host cell. In addition, one or more nucleotide sequence differences can be introduced that result in conservative amino acid changes in the encoded protein.

[00121] The coding sequence of any known DXP pathway enzyme may be altered in various ways known in the art to generate targeted changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded enzyme. The amino acid of a variant DXP pathway enzyme will in some embodiments be substantially similar to the amino acid sequence of any known DXP pathway enzyme, i.e. will differ by at least one amino acid, and may differ by at least two, at least 5, at least 10, or at least 20 amino acids, but typically not more than about fifty amino acids. The sequence changes may be substitutions, insertions or deletions. For example, as described below, the nucleotide sequence can be altered for the codon bias of a particular host cell.

Nucleotide sequences encoding prenyl transferases are known in the art. See, e.g., Human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase mRNA (GenBank Accession No. J05262; Homo sapiens); farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (FPP) gene (GenBank Accession No. J05091; Saccharomyces cerevisiae); isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase gene (J05090; Saccharomyces cerevisiae); <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wang and Ohnuma (2000) Biochim.

Suitable prokaryotic cells include, but are not limited to, any of a variety of laboratory strains of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus sp., Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., and the like. See, e.g., <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Carrier et al. (1992) /. Immunol. 148:1176-1181</bibl>; <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Patent No. 6,447,784</bibl>; and <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sizemore et al.

Guidance with respect to plant tissue culture may be found in, for example: <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Plant Cell and Tissue Culture, 1994, Vasil and Thorpe Eds., Kluwer Academic Publishers</bibl>; and in: <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Plant Cell Culture Protocols (Methods in Molecular Biology 111), 1999, Hall Eds, Humana Press</bibl>. 
[00145] A genetically modified host cell is useful for producing a biosynthetic product or a precursor biosynthetic product, where the level of the product or the precursor product produced in a genetically modified host cell is higher than the level of the product or the precursor product produced in a control host cell not genetically modified with a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold polypeptide. For example, the level of a producing a biosynthetic product or a precursor biosynthetic product produced in a genetically modified host cell is at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 100% (or two-fold), at least about 2.5-fold, at least about 3-fold, at least about 5-fold, at least about 7-fold, at least about 10-fold, at least about 15-fold, at least about 20-fold, at least about 50-fold, at least about 10 -fold, at least about 500-fold, or at least about 10&lt;3&gt;-fold, or more, higher than the level in a control host cell not genetically modified with a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold polypeptide.. 
[00146] In some embodiments, the biosynthetic product or a precursor biosynthetic product is one that is not normally produced by a control host cell, e.g., the biosynthetic product or a precursor biosynthetic product is an exogenous product. In other embodiments, the biosynthetic product or a precursor biosynthetic product is one that is normally produced by the host cell, but is produced by a genetically modified host cell in amounts that are greater than the amount that would be produced by a control host cell.

Suitable components include, but are not limited to, salts; buffers; stabilizers; protease-inhibiting agents; nuclease-inhibiting agents; cell membrane- and/or cell wall-preserving compounds, e.g., glycerol, dimethylsulfoxide, etc.; nutritional media appropriate to the cell; and the like. In some embodiments, the cells are lyophilized. METHODS OF PRODUCING A BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY PRODUCT OR PRECURSOR 
[00149] The present invention provides methods of producing a biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor, generally involving culturing a subject genetically modified host cell in a suitable medium and under suitable conditions to provide for production of the biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor. In some embodiments, the method is carried out in vitro (e.g., in a living cell cultured in vitro). In some of these embodiments, the host cell is a eukaryotic cell, e.g., a yeast cell. In other embodiments, the host cell is a prokaryotic cell. 
[00150] A subject genetically modified host cell provides for enhanced production of a biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor, compared to a control, parent host cell not genetically modified with a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold polypeptide. Thus, e.g., production of a biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor is at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 100% (or two-fold), at least about 2.5-fold, at least about 3-fold, at least about 5-fold, at least about 7-fold, at least about 10-fold, at least about 15-fold, at least about 20-fold, at least about 50- fold, at least about 10&lt;2&gt;-fold, at least about 500-fold, at least about 10&lt;3&gt;-fold, at least about 5 x 10&lt;3&gt;-fold, or at least about 10&lt;4&gt;-fold, or more, higher in the genetically modified host cell, compared to the level of the product produced in a control parent host cell. 
[00151] In some embodiments, a biosynthetic pathway product or a biosynthetic pathway precursor produced by a genetically modified host cell is produced in an amount of from about 10 mg/L to about 50 g/L, e.g., from about 10 mg/L to about 25 mg/L, from about 25 mg/L to about 50 mg/L, from about 50 mg/L to about 75 mg/L, from about 75 mg/L to about 100 mg/L, from about 100 mg/L to about 250 mg/L, from about 250 mg/L to about 500 mg/L, from about 500 mg/L to about 750 mg/L, from about 750 mg/L to about 1000 mg/L, from about 1 g/L to about 1.2 g/L, from about 1.2 g/L to about 1.5 g/L, from about 1.5 g/L to about 1.7 g/L, from about 1.7 g/L to about 2 g/L, from about 2 g/L to about 2.5 g/L, from about 2.5 g/L to about 5 g/L, from about 5 g/L to about 10 g/L, from about 10 g/L to about 20 g/L, from about 20 g/L to about 30 g/L, from about 30 g/L to about 40 g/L, or from about 40 g/L to about 50 g/L, or more, on a cell culture basis. 
[00152] A subject genetically modified host cell can be cultured in vitro in a suitable medium and at a suitable temperature. The temperature at which the cells are cultured is generally from about 18[deg.]C to about 40&lt;0&gt;C, e.g., from about 18[deg.]C to about 20&lt;0&gt;C, from about 20&lt;0&gt;C to about 25[deg.]C, from about 25[deg.]C to about 30&lt;0&gt;C, from about 30&lt;0&gt;C to about 35[deg.]C, or from about 35[deg.]C to about 40&lt;0&gt;C (e.g., at about 37[deg.]C). 
[00153] In some embodiments, a subject genetically modified host cell is cultured in a suitable medium 
(e.g., Luria-Bertoni broth, optionally supplemented with one or more additional agents, such as an inducer (e.g., where a nucleotide sequence encoding a biosynthetic pathway enzyme and/or a scaffold polypeptide is under the control of an inducible promoter)); and the biosynthetic pathway product or a biosynthetic pathway precursor is isolated from the cell culture medium and/or from cell lysates. In some embodiments, where one or more nucleotide sequences are operably linked to an inducible promoter, an inducer is added to the culture medium; and, after a suitable time, the product is isolated from the culture medium and/or from a cell lysate. 
[00154] In some embodiment, the culture medium is supplemented with a substrate for the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, where the substrate enters into the cell and is converted by the biosynthetic pathway into a product. In other embodiments, the substrate for the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway is made by the cell, and is converted by the biosynthetic pathway into a product. 
[00155] In some embodiments, a subject genetically modified host cell is cultured in a suitable medium and the culture medium is overlaid with an organic solvent, e.g. dodecane, forming an organic layer. In these embodiments, the biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor produced by the genetically modified host cell partitions into the organic layer, from which it can be purified. In some embodiments, where one or more nucleotide sequences are operably linked to an inducible promoter, an inducer is added to the culture medium; and, after a suitable time, the product is isolated from the organic layer overlaid on the culture medium. 
[00156] In some embodiments, the biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor will be separated from other products, macromolecules, etc., which may be present in the cell culture medium, the cell lysate, or the organic layer. Separation of the biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor from other products that may be present in the cell culture medium, cell lysate, or organic layer is readily achieved using, e.g., standard chromatographic techniques. Separation of the biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor from other products that may be present in the cell culture medium, cell lysate, or organic layer is readily achieved using, e.g., standard isolation techniques for small molecule products. For example, a method can involve pH adjustment and crystallization in organic solvent. Methods of isolating and purifying artemisinin, e.g., are known in the art; see, e.g., <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">U.S. Patent No. 6,685,972</bibl>. 
[00157] In some embodiments, a biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor synthesized by a subject method is further chemically modified in one or more cell-free reactions. 
[00158] In some embodiments, the biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor is pure, e.g., at least about 40% pure, at least about 50% pure, at least about 60% pure, at least about 70% pure, at least about 80% pure, at least about 90% pure, at least about 95% pure, at least about 98%, or more than 98% pure, where "pure" in the context of a biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor refers to a biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor that is free from other biosynthetic pathway product or biosynthetic pathway precursor, macromolecules, contaminants, etc. 
[00159] In some embodiments, the biosynthetic pathway precursor is mevalonate. In some embodiments, the biosynthetic pathway product is an artemisinin precursor (e.g., artemisinic alcohol, artemisinic aldehyde, artemisinic acid, etc.). In some of these embodiments, the artemisinin precursor product is pure, e.g., at least about 40% pure, at least about 50% pure, at least about 60% pure, at least about 70% pure, at least about 80% pure, at least about 90% pure, at least about 95% pure, at least about 98%, or more than 98% pure, where "pure" in the context of an artemisinin precursor refers to an artemisinin precursor that is free from side products, macromolecules, contaminants, etc. Biosynthetic pathway products and precursors 
[00160] As noted above, a subject method provides for production of a biosynthetic pathway product and/or a precursor of a biosynthetic pathway product in a subject genetically modified host cell. A precursor of a biosynthetic pathway product is also referred to as an "intermediate." Exemplary intermediates include, but are not limited to, isoprenoid precursors; alkaloid precursors; phenylpropanoid precursors; flavonoid precursors; steroid precursors; polyketide precursors; macrolide precursors; sugar alcohol precursors; phenolic compound precursors; and the like.

They are generally defined by the occurrence of a nitrogen atom in an oxidative state within a heterocyclic ring. Alkaloid compounds include benzylisoquinoline alkaloid compounds, indole alkaloid compounds, isoquinoline alkaloid compounds, and the like. Alkaloid compounds include monocyclic alkaloid compounds, dicyclic alkaloid compounds, tricyclic alkaloid compounds, tetracyclic alkaloid compounds, as well as alkaloid compounds with cage structures.

((2004) Trends Plant Science 9:116)</bibl>. 
[00163] The term "isoprenoid precursor compound" is used interchangeably with "isoprenoid precursor substrate" to refer to a compound that is a product of the reaction of a terpene synthase on a polyprenyl diphosphate. The product of action of a terpene synthase (also referred to as a "terpene cyclase") reaction is the so-called "terpene skeleton." In some embodiments, the isoprenoid-modifying enzyme catalyzes the modification of a terpene skeleton, or a downstream product thereof. Thus, in some embodiments, the isoprenoid precursor is a terpene skeleton. Isoprenoid precursors include monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, and sesquiterpenes.

Example 1 : Production of mevalonate 
[00170] Two strategies for balancing pathway flux have been successfully applied: modulating the expression levels of individual enzymes (via promoter strengths, ribosome binding site strengths, plasmid copy number, tunable intergenic regions controlling mRNA processing, etc.) and improving turnover activities of rate-limiting enzymes by directed evolution. Here we describe a distinct, but complementary, strategy for increasing overall pathway flux while simultaneously reducing metabolic loads. Pathway enzymes are co-localized to synthetic complexes in a programmable manner using engineered interactions between well-characterized protein-protein interaction domains and their specific ligands. Using this approach, enzyme assembly lines can be constructed in a generalizeable, scalable manner to increase the effective concentration of intermediate metabolites while maintaining their levels below toxicity limits. In addition, relative fluxes of individual enzymes can be balanced for optimal production yields by varying the number of interaction domain repeats targeting independent enzymes to the synthetic complex. 
[00171] The scaffolding strategy described herein includes certain features of natural systems exhibiting substrate channeling. Substrate channeling has several potential advantages: 1) reducing the loss of intermediates to diffusion or competing pathways, 2) protecting unstable intermediates from solvent and/or decreasing the transit time of intermediates, and 3) circumventing unfavorable equilibria and kinetics imposed by bulk-phase metabolite concentrations. Tryptophan synthase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase provide two illustrative examples of substrate channeling. Crystal structures and biochemical analysis have shown long tunnels that protect the reactive intermediates from the bulk solution. Polyketide synthases offer another interesting case of substrate channeling - modules consisting of assembly lines of catalytic activities where substrates are directly tethered to, and processively carried through, the enzyme modules via thioester linkages. These natural examples illustrate two approaches of substrate channeling: sequestration versus covalent tethering of intermediates. In this study, we aimed to approximate the behavior of these elegant substrate channeling enzyme systems, albeit with a much simpler design, in order to improve pathway flux in a programmable manner. 
[00172] The three-enzyme pathway that produces mevalonate from acetyl-CoA was selected as a model system. Mevalonate is a precursor for synthesis of the large isoprenoid family, members of which have therapeutic and commercial value, including the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. Most important for this study, the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway is not endogenous to the production host, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and heterologous expression can result in flux imbalances with high metabolic load. The first enzyme, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (AtoB), is native to E. coli, while the second and third enzymes, hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS) and hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), were imported from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and codon-optimized for expression in E. coli. The genes encoding the pathway enzymes were placed under the heterologous transcriptional regulation of inducible promoter systems, and modular control was gained by employing machinery evolved for signal processing in metazoan cells (Fig. 1). These machineries (protein-protein interaction domains and their ligands) are used in many different combinations in natural proteins to achieve different behaviors and in synthetic proteins capable of sophisticated gating. Thus, these domain/ligands have proven to be engineerable, as well as adaptable, and therefore provide excellent modular parts for building synthetic scaffolds. Importantly, since they are not naturally present in E. coli, the interaction domain/ligand pairs should be programmable with minimal cross-talk with the prokaryotic cellular milieu. 
[00173] As a direct test of engineered enzyme co-recruitment, the bottleneck enzymatic step of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway (HMGR-catalyzed turnover of HMG-CoA to mevalonate) was targeted for flux improvement. A synthetic complex of HMGS and HMGR was created by recombining a varying number of SH3 (Src Homology 3 domain from the adapter protein CRK) interaction ligands to the C-terminus of HMGS and recombining an SH3 domain to the N-terminus of HMGR (Fig. 2a). This simple design also allowed for control over the relative ratio of these two enzymes at the resultant complex. The ability of these proteins to interact in an SH3-dependent manner was probed in a GST pull-down experiment (Fig. 2b). An N-terminal GST-tagged HMGS with 0, 1, or 6 C-terminal SH3 peptide ligands (Kd=0.1 [mu]M) was used as bait. As prey, an SH3 domain was recombined to the N-terminus of HMGR and compared to HMGR alone. No significant interaction was observed between HMGS and HMGR without engineered SH3 interactions. However, HMGR with an N-terminal SH3 domain was pulled down by GST-tagged HMGS in a ligand-dependent manner. An observable amount of HMGR was pulled-down when a single ligand was tethered to HMGS, but significantly more was pulled-down when six ligands were tethered to HMGS. Thus, the relative stoichiometries of these two enzymes were controlled at the complex by varying the number of interaction ligands tethered to HMGS. 
[00174] The efficacy of improving mevalonate pathway flux in vivo was tested. To gain maximum control over expression levels, the genes encoding the first two enzymes of the pathway (AtoB and HMGS) were placed under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter (PBADX and the gene encoding HMGR was placed under expression control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Ptet)- All experiments were conducted with high expression levels of AtoB and HMGS, but low expression levels of the flux-limiting HMGR enzyme, to demonstrate that this bottleneck in the pathway could be overcome via synthase/reductase co-recruitment. Varying numbers of SH3 peptide ligands (0, 1, 3, 6, or 12), separated by flexible glycine-serine linkers, were recombined to the C-terminus of HMGS and co-expressed with HMGR either alone, or with an N-terminal SH3 domain tag. Improvement in mevalonate production was seen for engineered co -recruitment of HMGS/R enzymes (Fig. 2c). As expected, this improvement was dependent on the presence of both the SH3 domain and ligand and showed a dependence on the number of interactions. 
[00175] Interestingly, mevalonate production reached a maximum ~ 10-fold improvement with 6 possible interactions, but reduced somewhat (to 7-fold) when the number of possible interactions was further increased. Three explanations are possible: 1) the increased local concentration effect from enzyme co-localization may be diminished with increasing number of ligands spatially separating the co-localized enzymes when the pool of HMGR is insufficient to saturate all of the binding sites, 2) the limiting HMGR is sequestered such that it is unevenly distributed among the HMGS molecules, and/or 3) addition of too many SH3 ligands leads to HMGS misfolding. Thus, mevalonate yields can be improved through both engineered co-localization of HMGS and HMGR as well as optimization of the number of introduced interaction ligands. 
[00176] The scalability of the co-recruitment strategy was tested by building separate scaffold devices capable of co-localizing multiple enzymes. Scaffolds provide a means for physically separating the binding elements for design control from the catalytic activities. Thus, the only modification to the enzyme necessary for gaining modular control over complex formation is the addition of a single interaction ligand to each enzyme. A peptide ligand specific for a corresponding protein-protein interaction domain was recombined to the C-terminus of each enzyme of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 3a). Scaffolds were built by tethering together, via flexible nine amino acid glycine- serine linkers, different numbers of three protein-protein interaction domains from metazoan genomes: the GTPase Binding Domain (GBD) from the actin polymerization switch N-WASP, the SH3 domain, and the PSD95/DlgA/Zo-l (PDZ) domain from the adaptor protein syntrophin (see Table 1, below).

[00178] By varying the number of repeats of these interaction domains, the ratio of individual pathway enzymes co-localized to the resultant complex could be controlled. Scaffolds were built with a single GBD domain for recruiting AtoB and varying numbers of SH3 and PDZ domains for recruiting HMGS and HMGR, respectively. A matrix of scaffolds was made with the architecture (N-terminal to C- terminal) of GBDxSH3yPDZz where x=l and y and z were varied to be 1, 2, or 4. For separate inducible control, the pathway enzymes were placed under transcriptional control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter (Ptet), and the scaffolds were under transcriptional control of the arabinose-inducible promoter (PBAD)- In an effort to lower the metabolic load imposed on the production host, mevalonate production experiments were conducted with low expression levels of the mevalonate pathway enzymes (7 nM aTc) and a high scaffold expression level (250 [mu]M arabinose) to improve pathway efficiency. 
[00179] Mevalonate yields were measured for the unscaffolded pathway (GBDoSH3oPDZo or GoSoPo), and improvements in production were plotted for each scaffold (Fig. 3b). Remarkably, a 77-fold increase in mevalonate production was observed for the optimal scaffold (G1S2P2). Yield improvements were dependent on the number of interaction domain repeats in the scaffolds: varying the scaffold composition by a single domain often resulted in greater than an order of magnitude difference in mevalonate production. For example, scaffolds G1S2P2 and G1S1P2 differ by only one SH3 domain, yet produced dramatically different mevalonate yields: 77-fold versus 4-fold, respectively. Further, scaffolds with differing numbers of interaction domain repeats varied in their flux-enhancing profiles as the inducer was titrated to modulate scaffold expression (Fig. 3c). Scaffolds with higher numbers of domain repeats exhibited optimal mevalonate production at lower scaffold expression levels while scaffolds with fewer numbers of domain repeats showed optimal mevalonate production at higher concentrations of inducer for scaffold expression. Scaffolds with intermediate numbers of interaction domains show optimal activities at intermediate expression levels. At high concentrations of scaffold, non-functional scaffold:enzyme stoichiometries can exist where scaffold sequesters rather than co- localizes enzymes. 
[00180] The role of domain orientation in scaffold architecture was investigated by rearranging the interaction domains of the optimized scaffold G1S2P2 to G1S1P2S1 and G1S1P1S1P1 (see Figure 10). Compared to the optimal scaffold G1S2P2, scaffolds G1S1P2S1 and G1S1P1S1P1 showed marked decreases in mevalonate production; 10-fold and 22-fold higher yields than the unscaffolded pathway, respectively, as opposed to the 77 -fold improvement with G1S2P2. Similarly, the effect of scaling the number of enzymes recruited to the scaffold was investigated by making scaffolds that recruited only HMGS and HMGR (see Figure 11). Enhancement of mevalonate biosynthesis was greater with scaffolds built to recruit all three enzymes than for those recruiting only HMGS/R (77-fold versus 8.5- fold). Thus, both the number of interaction domains targeting the enzymes to the scaffold and their orientation had dramatic impacts on their ability to increase pathway flux. 
[00181] The role of scaffolding in flux enhancement was verified through a series of control experiments. First, a competing PDZ ligand was incorporated into the mevalonate pathway operon as a GST fusion and co-expressed with scaffold G1S2P2 (GiS2P2-competitorl in Fig. 9a). As expected, yields were lower than the same construct lacking the competitive PDZ ligand (GiS2P2). Mevalonate production was further decreased when the expression level of the GST-tagged PDZ ligand was increased by driving expression with PBAD on a high copy plasmid (GiS2P2-competitor2). To verify that the scaffolding effect depends upon the peptide ligands recombined to each enzyme, they were removed (GiS2P2[Delta]ligands); a dramatic decrease in mevalonate production, compared to G1S2P2, was observed. Recombining the peptide ligands to the pathway enzymes did seem to lower their collective activities somewhat as GiS2P2[Delta]ligands (without peptide ligands) produced approximately 7.5-fold higher mevalonate yields than G0S0Po or the control where instead of a scaffold, GFP was expressed (G0S0P0- GFP). However, this loss of activity was more than compensated for via scaffolding (GiS2P2). The ability to tag enzymes with interaction ligands without perturbing function will be protein-dependent and may require searching for accommodating locations for peptide insertions in other enzyme structures. 
[00182] A practical advantage of scaffolding is the improvement in pathway efficiency, allowing equivalent or higher yields to be achieved at lower enzyme expression levels than without the scaffold. Even at saturating inducer concentrations, the unscaffolded pathway (G0S0P0) did not reach the mevalonate yields of the scaffolded pathway (GiS2P2) under basal expression levels (Fig. 9b). These scaffold-dependent increases in mevalonate production decreased as expression of pathway enzymes increased, suggesting the concentration of scaffold was not sufficient to maintain function with high pathway enzyme concentrations. Similarly, the cell cultures with the scaffolded pathway saturated at grew to higher optical densities than those harboring the non-scaffolded pathway when pathway enzyme expression levels were low (see Figure 12). However, this improvement in cell growth was not maintained when pathway enzyme expression was increased. In this manner, the metabolic load introduced with an engineered metabolic pathway can be significantly reduced by both increasing the efficiency of the pathway and lowering the necessary expression levels of the pathway enzymes. Further supporting this scaffold-dependent improvement in pathway efficiency is the observation that mevalonate yields improved dramatically when the medium was supplemented with high concentrations of glycerol, but only when the pathway was scaffolded by GiS2P2 (Figure 13). Thus, scaffolds allowed the pathway to better utilize the increased carbon substrate, allowing higher product yields to be achieved with lower enzyme expression and decreasing the metabolic burden on the production host. [00183] In this study, the naturally-evolved modularity of protein -protein interaction domains was employed to facilitate the rapid design and optimization of flux-increasing scaffolds. This strategy was inspired by natural biosynthetic machines (e.g., polyketide synthases, fatty acid synthases, and non- ribosomal peptide synthases) that produce small molecules by channeling intermediates iteratively through assembly lines of catalytic activities. Although simpler than these elegant natural systems, the modular design of the scaffold strategy described herein is programmable, scalable, and generalizeable. Importantly, scaffolding presents a strategy that can complement conventional strategies for balancing enzymatic activities for achieving increased product yields. The modular scaffold design facilitated the rapid optimization of pathway flux. This modularity provides programmability over the stoichiometry of enzymes recruited to the functional complex as well as scalability for increasing the number of enzymes in the pathway that are scaffolded. Since this design does not depend on structural characteristics of an enzyme, other than the ability to tether a short peptide ligand without perturbing activity, it should prove to be generalizeable to other pathways. 
[00184] Figures IA-C. Employing metazoan machinery for modular control over pathway flux, (a) 
The genes encoding the mevalonate pathway enzymes (HMGS and HMGR) were taken from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and transformed into Escherichia coli along with the E. coli gene encoding AtoB. These enzymes have different levels of activity, creating a bottleneck and, as a result, accumulation of the intermediate HMG-CoA that is toxic to E. coli at high concentrations, (b) Protein- protein interaction domains and ligands from metazoan cells (mouse SH3 and PDZ domains and rat GBD) were used to design regulation machinery and transformed into these same E. coli cells. Thus, both the mevalonate pathway enzymes and the regulation machinery are heterologous to E. coli. (c) The scaffolded pathway is more efficient as a result of co-localizing the mevalonate enzymes to the same complex as well as optimizing the enzyme stoichiometry to balance the units of activity at the complex. 
[00185] Figures 2A-C. Direct control over enzyme stoichiometry of a synthetic complex can be introduced with heterologous protein-protein interaction domain/ligands. (a) A varying number of SH3 ligands were recombined to the C-terminus of HMGS, and an SH3 domain was recombined to the N- terminus of HMGR. (b) A GST pull-down was performed using HMGS bait with 0, 1, or 6 SH3 ligands and HMGR prey with and without an N-terminal SH3 domain. An interaction was only observed when both interaction partners were present and increased amounts of prey were pulled-down as the number of ligands was increased, (c) Mevalonate production increased as the number of ligands recombined to HMGS was increased until it reached a maximum of approximately 10-fold with 6 ligands. Improvements in mevalonate yield over that from the unscaffolded pathway decreased to approximately 7-fold when the number of ligands was further increased to 12. These significant yield increases required the recombination of a corresponding SH3 domain to HMGR. Error bars show 1 SD from an average of three separate experiments. [00186] Figures 3A-C. Modular control over metabolic pathway flux was gained via synthetic scaffolds built from modular protein-protein interaction domains, (a) The mevalonate pathway was placed under expression control of Ptet, and expression of the synthetic scaffolds was controlled by PBAD- The synthetic scaffolds were constructed with three protein-protein interaction domains (GBD, SH3, and PDZ) where x, y, and z represents the number of repeats of these domains, respectively, (b) A matrix of nine scaffolds exhibited dramatic differences in mevalonate product yields. Optimizing the relative number of recruitment domains (GBD1SHSIPDZ2 or G1S2P2) for maximum pathway flux resulted in a 77-fold increase in product yield compared to the non-scaffolded pathway (GoSoPo). Improvements in mevalonate yields were strongly dependent on scaffold architecture, (c) The scaffold induction level for optimal mevalonate production is dependent on the number of interaction domains. Scaffolds with higher numbers of interaction domain repeats (G1S4P4) showed optimal mevalonate production at lower scaffold inducer concentrations than scaffolds with fewer domain repeats (GiS2P2). Scaffolds with intermediate numbers of repeats (GiS4P2 and GiS2P4) showed optimal production at intermediate inducer concentrations.

[00188] Figures 9A-C. Dependence of scaffold in enhancement in mevalonate production, (a) 
Mevalonate production from the optimal scaffold GiS2P2 was compared to that from control constructs (GoSoPo-GFP, GiS2P2-competitorl, GiS2P2-competitor2, GiS2P2[Delta]ligands). Expressing the green fluorescent protein (GoSoPo-GFP) instead of a scaffold produced comparable mevalonate yields to expression of G0S0Po. GiS2P2-competitorl was identical to GiS2P2 with the exception of the addition of a competing PDZ ligand fused to a GST protein co-expressed as the last gene in the pathway operon. GiS2P2-competitorl produced less mevalonate than GiS2P2, 29-fold versus 77-fold improvements over no scaffold, respectively. Increased expression of this competing PDZ ligand (GiS2P2-competitor2) was achieved with a separate high copy plasmid (CoIEl origin) with PBAD induced to saturation. The fold increase in mevalonate production over no scaffold was further decreased to 9-fold. The necessity of the peptide tags recombined to the pathway enzymes was confirmed with construct GiS2P2[Delta]ligands. (b) Use of synthetic scaffolds allows higher mevalonate yields to be achieved even with lower expression of pathway enzymes. High expression was achieved with an inducer concentration of 225 nM anhydrotetracycline, while low expression was achieved with 7 nM anhydrotetracycline. Error bars show 1 SD from an average of three separate experiments. 
[00189] Figure 10. Domain rearrangements in scaffold architecture dramatically impact pathway flux. 
For all constructs tested, the mevalonate biosynthesis pathway with recombined interaction domain ligands were expressed by the pTET promoter and the various scaffolds were expressed by the pBAD promoter. G0S0P0-GFP provides a control of the same mevalonate biosynthesis pathway with interaction domain peptides recombined to the pathway enzymes but lacking a functional scaffold. Instead, expression of GFP is driven by the pBAD promoter. G1S2P2 represents the optimized scaffold with 1, 2, and 2 repeats of GBD, SH3, and PDZ domains, respectively, which produces 77 -fold more mevalonate than GoSoPo-GFP. G1S1P2S1 and G1S1P1S1P1 contain the same identity and number of interaction domains as G1S2P2 but the arrangement of the HMGS and HMGR -recruiting SH3 and PDZ domains was varied in these scaffold architectures. These showed that scaffold architecture dramatically influences the ability of the scaffold to balance pathway flux. 
[00190] Figure 11. Probing the scalability of scaffold design. Mevalonate yields with the optimized scaffold G1S2P2 that targets all three of the mevalonate biosynthesis enzymes was compared to scaffold G0S2P2 that targets only the HMGS/R enzymes. G1S2P2, which targets all three enzymes produces a 77- fold higher mevalonate yield than the unscaffolded pathway, whereas G0S2P2 only improves mevalonate production 8.5-fold. 
[00191] Figure 12. Cell density at saturation is higher for scaffolded pathway at low induction of pathway enzymes but similar at high expression of the pathway enzymes. Scaffolding appears to increase cell viability when the expression of the pathway enzymes is low, but this benefit is lost when pathway expression is increased. 
[00192] Figure 13. Scaffolds exhibit glycerol dependence in mevalonate product enhancement. 
Addition of glycerol as a carbon source would be predicted to increase flux through the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway. Increasing concentrations of glycerol led to modest increases in mevalonate production without scaffold but significant increases when the pathway enzymes were scaffolded with optimized GiS2P2- These increases saturated with approximately 4% glycerol. All experiments in this manuscript were conducted with 4% glycerol.
