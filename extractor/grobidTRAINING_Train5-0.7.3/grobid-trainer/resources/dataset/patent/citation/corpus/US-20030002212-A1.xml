Several processes have been developed to reduce write head size and improve manufacturing processes. The stitched head and partial pole trim processes are processes where the write poles are formed in separate deposition steps. </p><p>[0005] A challenge to producing narrower write gap widths is to use thinner upper pole layers with the partial pole trim processes. </p><p>[0006] The importance of overcoming the various deficiencies noted above is evidenced by the extensive technological development directed to the subject, as documented by the relevant patent and technical literature. The closest and apparently more relevant technical developments in the patent literature can be gleaned by considering <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 5,875,080</ref> (Seagle) that discloses a write head process with a pole trim step and a process for forming a second set of coils over the second pole. </p><p>[0007] <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 5,935,644</ref> (Heim et al.) shows a zero throat height of a write head by recessing the first insulation layer within the first pole piece. </p><p>[0008] <ref type="patent">U.S. Pat. No. 4,875,987</ref> (Wada et al.) shows a grooved substrate where the coils are formed over the groove for a magnetic head. </p><p>[0009] However, these further improvement is required </p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading><p>[0010] It is an object of the present invention to provide a structure and method for fabricating a write head which can over come the high aspect ratio limitations of photographic techniques for defining the upper pole (P<b>3</b>). </p><p>[0011] It is an object of the present invention to provide a structure and a method for write head that has a sunken shared pole (S<b>1</b> and P<b>1</b>) that has a reduce thickness that reduces the aspect ratio. </p><p>[0012] It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for fabricating a write head that uses chemical-mechanical polish steps to planarize dielectric layers. </p><p>[0013] To accomplish the above objectives, the present invention provides a structure and a method of manufacturing a write head having a sunken share pole which is characterized as follows. The method includes forming a bottom coil dielectric layer over the first half shared pole. Coils are formed over the bottom coil dielectric layer. Next, second half shared poles (P<b>1</b>) are formed over the first half shared pole (S<b>2</b>). We form a top coil dielectric layer over the structure. In a key step, we chemical-mechanical polish the top coil dielectric layer. A write gap layer (WG) is formed over the front second half shared pole and the top coil dielectric layer over the coils. An upper pole (P<b>3</b>) and hard mask are formed over the write gap layer. We etch the write gap layer and the second half shared pole (P<b>1</b>) using the upper pole as an etch mask to remove a portion of the second half shared pole (P<b>1</b>) adjacent to the write gap layer thereby forming a partially trimmed pole. </p><p>[0014] Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the append claims. </p><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading><p>[0015] The features and advantages of a semiconductor device according to the present invention and further details of a process of fabricating such a semiconductor device in accordance with the present invention will be more clearly understood from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals designate similar or corresponding elements, regions and portions and in which. </p><p>[0016]FIGS. 1, 2, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B cross sectional views for illustrating a structure and a method for forming a write head according to the present invention. </p><p>[0017]FIGS. 8A and 8B are air bearing surface (ABS) views for illustrating the structure and method of the present invention. </p><p>[0018]FIGS. 9A and 9B are air bearing surface (ABS) views for a write head process known by the inventors upon which the present invention is an improvement over. </p><p>[0019]FIGS. 10A and 10B are cross sectional views for a write head process known by the inventors upon which the present invention is an improvement over.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading><p>[0020] A. The Problem the Invention Solves </p><p>[0021] Referring now to the drawing and more particularly to FIGS. 9A, 9B, <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B, there is shown an air bearing surface (ABS) view of a head structure over which the present invention is an improvement. It is to be understood in this regard that no portion of FIGS. 9A, 9B, <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B, is admitted to be prior art to the present invention. Rather, this highly simplified diagram is an effort to provide an improved understanding of the problems that are overcome by the invention. </p><p>[0022]FIG. 9A shows a bottom Shared pole (S<b>1</b>), a top shared pole (S<b>2</b>), a write gap (WG), a top P<b>2</b> pole and a top P<b>3</b> pole. A major problem with this design is that the P<b>2</b> pole must be very thick prior to the ion beam etch (IBE) that uses the P<b>2</b> as an etch mask to IBE etch the partial trim <b>200</b> in the S<b>2</b>. </p><p>[0023]FIG. 9A shows the partial pole trim etch (PPT) (e g, IBE etch ) that defines trims the bottom pole (see area <b>200</b>), the write gap and the upper pole (P<b>2</b>). The dashed lines represent the Shared pole S<b>2</b> before the ion beam etch (IBE). In the ion beam etch (IBE) a height the P<b>2</b> is etched away. This extra height <b>202</b> causes problems in accurately patterning the Pole (e.g., mushroom pole profile). This extra height increases the aspect ratio of the second pole (P<b>2</b>). </p><p>[0024] Referring to FIG. 10A, a dielectric layer (D) is formed over the WG and the P<b>2</b>. As shown in FIG. 10A, a chemical-mechanical polish (CMP) is used to planarize the D layer Unfortunately, the CMP removes some of the P<b>2</b>. </p><p>[0025]FIGS. 9B and 10B show the completed head with the P<b>3</b> layer formed over the P<b>2</b>. After the P<b>2</b> IBE etch, and D layer CMP, coils and a coil dielectric layer (CD) are formed. Next, P<b>3</b> layer is formed over the coil dielectric layer (CD) and P<b>2</b>. The P<b>2</b> and P<b>3</b> form the upper pole of the write head. </p><p>[0026] Also, as the future requirements of the write gap width decrease, say to 0.25 μm wide, the aspect ratio increases: for example, the </p><p>[0027] P<b>2</b> thickness requirement=final P<b>2</b> thickness (1.5 μm)+Partial Pole trim P<b>2</b> consumption (1.5 μm) and CMP consumption of P<b>2</b> (0.5 μm)=about 3.5 μm. </p><p>[0028] Therefore, the aspect ratio is=height/width=3.5 μm/0.25=14:1. Because of this high aspect ratio requirement, there needs to be a new method to perform head stitching that reduces the write upper pole aspect ratio so that thinner write gap widths can be achieved in the future. </p><p>[0029] B. Invention Uses a Sunken Shared Pole to Reduce Upper Pole (P<b>3</b>) Thickness </p> <p>[0030] FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>8</b>B shows a preferred embodiment of the invention of a method of fabricating a stitched write head having a sunken share pole. The term “sunken shared pole” comes from the configuration of the invention's S<b>1</b> and P<b>1</b> layers that comprise the shared pole. The write gap <b>58</b> (WG) is over the shared pole (S<b>2</b> (<b>26</b>) and P<b>1</b> (<b>50</b>)) (See FIG. 8) and therefore the shared pole (S<b>2</b> &amp; P<b>1</b>) is referred to as sunken. Compared to the process known to the inventors(See FIG. 10B), the invention's S<b>1</b> and P<b>1</b> are sunken. The invention's coils are also “sunken” so that the coils are in the same plane as the P<b>1</b> layers The method and structure are described below. </p><p>[0031] Referring to FIG. 1, we form an undercoat dielectric layer <b>10</b> over a substrate (not shown, up under the undercoat dielectric layer) The undercoat dielectric layer <b>10</b> can be formed on any conventional material such as alumina, or SiC. </p><p>[0032] C. Form a Bottom Shield (S<b>1</b>) <b>14</b> over the Undercoat Dielectric Layer <b>10</b></p><p>[0033] Next, we form a bottom shield (S<b>1</b>) <b>14</b> over the undercoat dielectric layer <b>10</b>. The bottom shield layer (S<b>1</b>) <b>14</b> is deposited and patterned using conventional patterning techniques. The bottom shield layer is preferably comprised of NiFe (e.g., Ni45Fe55), Ni<sub>80</sub>Fe<sub>20 </sub>or laminated NiFe/Ta. </p> <p>[0034] D. Form a Bottom Shield Dielectric Layer <b>18</b> </p><p>[0035] Still referring to FIG. 1, a bottom shield dielectric layer <b>18</b> is formed over the bottom shield (S<b>1</b>) <b>14</b> and the undercoat layer <b>10</b>. The bottom shield layer <b>18</b> is preferably deposited by a sputter deposit method. The bottom shield layer <b>18</b> is preferably composed of Alumina or SiO<sub>2 </sub>and most preferably is composed of Alumina. </p> <p>[0036] E. Chemical-Mechanical Polishing the Bottom Shield Dielectric Layer <b>18</b></p><p>[0037] In a key step, we chemical-mechanical polish the bottom shield dielectric layer <b>18</b> to make the bottom shield dielectric layer <b>18</b> co-planar with the bottom shield <b>14</b>. This is a critical step because it make the subsequent layers planar and reduce the aspect ratio for the P<b>2</b>. </p><p>[0038] F. Form a Read Gap Dielectric <b>22</b> and MR Sensor <b>30</b></p><p>[0039] Next, we form a read gap dielectric <b>22</b> and MR sensor <b>30</b> structure over the bottom shield dielectric layer <b>18</b> and the bottom shield <b>14</b>. The read gap dielectric layer surrounding the MR sensor. The read gap dielectric layer is preferably a multiple layer structure such as a bottom read gap layer and a top read gap layer overlying the MR sensor and the bottom read gap layer. </p><p>[0040] The MR sensor is preferably a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor, but can be other conventional MR sensors. </p><p>[0041] G. FIG. 1—Form a First Half Shared Pole <b>26</b> (S<b>2</b>) </p><p>[0042] Still referring to FIG. 1, we form a first half shared pole <b>26</b> (S<b>2</b>) over the read gap dielectric <b>22</b>. The first half shared pole <b>26</b> (S<b>2</b>) is preferably sputter deposited. The first half shared pole layer <b>26</b> is patterned preferably by a formed by a photoresist and etch process. </p><p>[0043] H. FIGS. <b>1</b> &amp; <b>2</b>—Form a Shared Pole Dielectric Layer <b>34</b></p><p>[0044] As shown in FIGS. 1 &amp; 2, we form a shared pole dielectric layer <b>34</b> over the gap dielectric layer <b>22</b> and the first half shared pole <b>26</b> (S<b>2</b>) The share pole dielectric layer <b>34</b> is preferably formed by a sputter process and is preferably composed of alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>). The share pole dielectric layer <b>34</b> preferably has a thickness (before CMP) of between about 3.0 and 6.0 μm. </p><p>[0045] L. CMP the Shared Pole Dielectric Layer <b>34</b> and the First Half Shared Pole <b>26</b> (S<b>2</b>) </p><p>[0046] Still referring to FIGS. 1 &amp; 2, in a critical step, we chemical-mechanical polish the shared pole dielectric layer <b>34</b> and the first half shared pole <b>26</b> (S<b>2</b>) to make the shared pole dielectric layer <b>34</b> and coplanar the first half shared pole <b>26</b> (S<b>2</b>). It is critical that the shared pole dielectric layer <b>34</b> and the first half shared pole <b>26</b> (S<b>2</b>) are coplanar. </p><p>[0047] J. FIG. 2—Forming a Bottom Coil Dielectric Layer <b>42</b></p><p>[0048] As shown in FIG. 2, we next form a bottom coil dielectric layer <b>42</b> over the first half shared pole <b>26</b>. The bottom coil dielectric layer is preferably sputter deposited and patterned. The bottom coil dielectric layer preferably is composed of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or SiO<sub>2 </sub>and preferably has a thickness of between about 2000 and 5000 Å</p><p>[0049] K. FIG. 3—Form Coils <b>46</b></p><p>[0050] As shown in FIG. 3, we form coils <b>46</b> over the bottom coil dielectric layer <b>42</b>. The coils are preferably formed by an electroplating process and preferably are composed of Cu material. The coils <b>46</b> preferably have a thickness of between about 1.0 and 3.0 μm. The coils are preferably helical shaped when viewed from a top down view. </p><p>[0051] L. FIG. 4—Forming Second Half Shared Poles <b>50</b> (P<b>1</b>) </p><p>[0052] As shown in FIG. 4, we form second half shared poles (P<b>1</b>) over the first half shared pole <b>26</b> (<b>52</b>). The second half shared poles (P<b>1</b>) are comprised of a front second half shared pole <b>50</b>A and a back second half shared pole <b>50</b>B. </p><p>[0053] To form the front second half shared pole <b>50</b>A and a back second half shared pole <b>50</b>B, we deposit a second half shared poles <b>50</b> (P<b>1</b>) layer (not shown) and then patterned using a photolithography and etch process. Alternatively, the front second half shared pole <b>50</b>A and a back second half shared pole <b>50</b>B are plated using a frame plating technique. </p><p>[0054] The front second half shared pole <b>50</b>A and a back second half shared pole <b>50</b>B are preferably composed of (what materials) NiFe, or CoNiFe The poles can be composed of high moment materials such as Ni45Fe55, or CoNiFe. </p><p>[0055] M. FIG. 5—Form a Top Coil Dielectric Layer <b>54</b></p><p>[0056] As shown in FIG. 5, we form a top coil dielectric layer <b>54</b> over the bottom coil dielectric layer <b>42</b>, the coils <b>46</b> and the shared pole dielectric layer <b>34</b>. The top coil dielectric layer <b>54</b> is preferably composed of alumina or hard baked photoresist. The top coil dielectric layer preferably has a thickness of between about 2.0 and 4.0 μm. </p><p>[0057] N. CMP the Top Coil Dielectric Layer <b>54</b></p><p>[0058] In a critical step, as shown in FIG. 6, we planarize (preferably by chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP)), the top coil dielectric layer <b>54</b> and the second half shared poles <b>50</b>A <b>50</b>B to make the top coil dielectric layer <b>54</b> (<b>54</b>A <b>54</b>B) about coplanar with the second half shared poles <b>50</b>A <b>50</b>B (P<b>1</b>). </p><p>[0059] Other planarization processes that can be used in addition to CMP, such as RIE etchback. However, these are not as efficient as chemical-mechanical polish. </p><p>[0060] O. FIG. 6—Form a Write gap Layer <b>58</b> (WG) </p><p>[0061] Still referring to FIG. 6, we then form a write gap layer <b>58</b> (WG) over the front second half shared pole <b>50</b>A and the top coil dielectric layer <b>54</b>A over the coils <b>46</b>. The write gap layer is preferably composed of Alumina, or SiO<sub>2 </sub>and preferably has a thickness of between about 1000 and 3000 Å. </p><p>[0062] P. FIG. 7—Form a Upper Pole (P<b>3</b>) </p><p>[0063] Referring to FIG. 7, we form a upper pole (P<b>3</b>) over the write gap layer <b>58</b>. The upper pole layer is preferably plated deposited over the write gap layer <b>58</b> and the second half shared poles (P<b>1</b>). The upper pole (P<b>3</b>) is preferably composed of NiFe (e.g., Ni<sub>45</sub>Fe<sub>55</sub>) and preferably has a thickness of between about 1.4 and 4.0 μm and more preferably between 1.5 and 2.9 μm. </p><p>[0064] Q. FIG. 8A—Form an Alumina Hard Mask Over Upper Pole </p><p>[0065] As shown in FIG. 8A, a mask layer <b>68</b> (HM) is formed over the upper pole. Most preferably the mask is a hard mask such as alumina. The masking layer can be formed of any masking material such as a hard mask material of alumina or a photoresist material. The hard mask layer is patterned using conventional photolithography to form a hard mask that defines the upper pole (P<b>3</b>). The hard mask <b>68</b> is then used as a IBE hard mask in the subsequent Ion Beam etch (IBE) that defines the upper pole, write gap <b>59</b> and partial trim P<b>1</b> (<b>50</b>). The hard mask is preferably composed of alumina so that one can take advantage of the high selectivity of the ion beam etch ratio between the upper pole and the alumina hard mask. Since thinner alumina is used to replace the conventional resist mask, less shadowing effect and high pole trimming efficiency is achieved with the invention's alumina hard mask. Therefore, thinner upper poles (P<b>3</b>) can be used to define the trimmed lower pole. See FIG. 8B. </p><p>[0066] The hard mask <b>68</b> preferably has a thickness of between about 3000 and 6000 Å and more preferably between 4000 and 5000 Å. In contrast, a conventional photoresist mask has a thickness of between about 2.0 and 3.00 μm. Therefore the invention's hard mask is much thinner and allows better Pole with control in the photo and IBE processes (e.g., lower aspect ratio). </p><p>[0067] R. FIG. 8A—Etching the Write Gap Layer <b>58</b> and the Second Half Shared Pole <b>50</b> (P<b>1</b>) </p><p>[0068] As shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B, we etch the write gap layer <b>58</b> and the second half shared pole <b>50</b> (P<b>1</b>) using the hard mask (HM) <b>68</b> and upper pole <b>66</b> as an etch masks to remove a portion of the second half shared pole <b>50</b> (P<b>1</b>) adjacent to the write gap layer <b>58</b> thereby forming a partially trimmed pole. </p><p>[0069]FIG. 8B shows an air bearing surface (ABS) view of the head after the IBE and the removal of the hard mask. </p><p>[0070] S. Benefits-Reduced Aspect Ratio </p><p>[0071] The invention reduces the required thickness of the upper pole (P<b>3</b>) layer. The invention's initial P<b>3</b> layer thickness is only (a) designed PPT P<b>3</b> thickness and the amount of P<b>3</b> that is IBE away in any the PPT process. </p><p>[0072] For example, initial P<b>3</b> thickness=final p<b>3</b> design (1.5 μm) and the P<b>2</b> consumed in the PPE (0.5 μM) therefore the initial P<b>3</b> thickness =2 μm. Therefore, the P<b>3</b> aspect ratio is (1.5 μm+0.5 μm)/0.25 m=2/0.25=8.1. This contrasts with the inventor's prior process that had an P<b>2</b> aspect ratio of 14:1. See above. </p><p>[0073] T.
