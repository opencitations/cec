fire-retardant, thermoplastic elastomer mixture.</p><heading><b><u style="single">Background Of The Invention</u></b></heading><p num="0002">In a variety of applications of practical importance, conductive plastic parts are
utilized in electronic assemblies. Thus, for example, conductive plastic parts are often
employed for grounding, static discharge and electromagnetic interference (EMI)
shielding purposes. Typical parts made of conductive plastic in electronic assemblies
include grounding grommets, conductive gaskets, flexible grounding straps, protective
boots and face-plate panels for circuit packages.</p><p num="0003">An exemplary two-part unitary panel comprises an electrically non-conductive
rigid plastic part combined with an electrically conductive plastic part that serves as a
flexible gasket. The panel is utilized to seal an opening in an electronic assembly to
reduce the passage of EMI through the enclosure opening.</p><p num="0004">For the above-specified and other applications, workers skilled in the art have
continued to try to develop improved conductive soft-durometer plastic materials. In
particular, these attempts have been focused on developing improved conductive plastic
materials that can be molded into complex geometries, that are relatively economical
and that are recyclable. It was recognized that these efforts, if successful, could reduce
the cost and improve the performance of electronic assemblies that include plastic parts
made of such materials.</p><p num="0005"><ref type="patent">JP-A-59 155 448</ref> is directed to a flame-retardant resin composition. having high
electromagnetic wave shielding power and good processability and moldability. The
composition consists of a thermoplastic resin, an aluminum or aluminum alloy,
electrically conductive carbon black, a halogen-containing organic compound, antimony
oxide and a hydrated inorganic material. The thermoplastic resin is selected among: a
styrene containing polymer; a polymer obtained by treating a high molecular weight
material selected from rubbery materials and polyphenylene ether with a monomer
group containing styrene; and a mixture of the styrene containing polymer and high-molecular
weight material.</p><p num="0006"><ref type="patent">EP-A-0 137 290</ref> is directed to a resin composition having an electromagnetic
wave shielding effect. The resin composition comprises 35 to 90 wt % of an ABS resin 
or a mixture of the ABS resin and an AS resin, 1 to 25 wt % of a plasticizer and 5 to 40
wt % of carbon fibers. The carbon fibers are uniformly dispersed in the resin ingredient
without being broken or cut at the step of mixing and dispersing the resin components,
thus exhibiting improved electromagnetic wave shielding effect. Moreover, the carbon
fibers are one or a mixture of two or more of carbonized polyacrylonitrile fibers,
carbonized pitch fibers and carbonized phenolic compound fibers. (Page 12, Lines 5-7).
The fibers can have a broad range of preferred diameters (5 to 12 microns), lengths (2
to 20 mm) and bundle counts (1000 to 20000).</p><heading><b><u style="single">Summary of the Invention</u></b></heading><p num="0007">A method according to the invention is as set out in claim 1. Preferred forms are
set out in the dependent claims.</p><p num="0008">In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a conductive soft-durometer
fire-retardant thermoplastic mixture comprises a base thermoplastic
elastomer material combined with a fire-retardant material and a matrix of small-diameter
conductive fibers. In one specific illustrative example, the mixture includes a
styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) plastic material combined with antimony
trioxide and metal-coated graphite fibers. In one particular formulation, antimony
trioxide comprises about 10-to-20 per cent by volume of the mixture and the metal-coated
graphite fibers comprise approximately 5-to-25 per cent by volume of the
mixture, with the base elastomer material comprising the remaining volume of the
mixture.</p><heading><b><u style="single">Brief Description Of The Drawing</u></b></heading><p num="0009">A complete understanding of the present invention and of the above and other
features and advantages thereof may be gained from a consideration of the following
detailed description presented hereinbelow in connection with the accompanying
drawing, not drawn to scale, in which:
<sl><li>FIG. 1 is a rear perspective view of a shielded panel that includes a specific
illustrative gasket made in accordance with the principles of the present invention;</li><li>FIG. 2 is a front face view of one of the metal-coated fibers included in the
inventive formulation;</li><li>and FIG. 3 is a front perspective view showing a multiplicity of the FIG. 2 fibers
bundled together.</li></sl></p><heading><b><u style="single">Detailed Description</u></b></heading><p num="0010">FIG. 1 illustrates one particular example of a portion of an electronic assembly
that includes a plastic part made in accordance with the principles of the present
invention. Specifically, FIG. 1 shows a two-part panel 10 that comprises a front
electrically non-conductive part 20 bonded to a back conductive shield or gasket part
30. In overall structure, the two-part panel 10 is similar to the panel 10 described in the
introduction. But the part 30 shown in FIG. 1 is formed of a material made using the
principles of the present invention. This unique material comprises a conductive soft-durometer
synthetic rubber that is fire-retardant.</p><p num="0011">Hereinafter, emphasis will be directed to formulating a mixture and then
molding only a single illustrative part such as the part 30 represented in FIG. 1. But it
should be understood that it is often advantageous to fabricate a multi-element
component such as the two-part panel shown in FIG. 1 in a single injection-molding
operation, as described in detail in the aforecited application.</p><p num="0012">In accordance with the principles of the present invention, plural individual
commercially available component materials are combined to form a unique mixture.
One component of this mixture comprises a standard base thermoplastic elastomer
commonly known as styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) material. More
specifically, this material advantageously comprises, for example, a conventional SEBS
material such as Shell Kraton material, which is readily available from a chemical
supplier such as Shell Chemical Co., 1 Shell Plaza, Houston, Texas 77002.
Illustratively, the elastomer is supplied in pellet form, each pellet measuring about 0.32
centimeters (cm) in length and having a diameter of approximately 0.32 cm.</p><p num="0013">The second component of the inventive mixture comprises conductive elements.
Advantageously, each of these elements comprises a metal-coated graphite fiber. Other
conductive elements such as metal flakes or metal-coated mica are also feasible.</p><p num="0014">By way of a specific example, a front face view of a conventional metal-coated
graphite fiber 40 is shown in FIG. 2. In one particular illustrative case, the overall
diameter D1 of the FIG. 2 fiber is only about six micrometers (µm).</p><p num="0015">The illustrative coated fiber 40 of FIG. 2 includes, for example, a four-µm-diameter
graphite core 42. To enhance the electrical conductivity of the core 42, it is
advantageous to coat the core with one or more layers of a relatively high-conductivity
material. Thus, for example, the particular fiber 40 of FIG. 2 is shown as having layers 
44 through 46 formed thereon. Illustratively, the layers 44 through 46 respectively
comprise: a 0.15-µm-thick layer of nickel, a 0.1-µm-thick layer of copper and a 0.15-µm-thick
layer of nickel.</p><p num="0016">As noted above, the diameter of an individual coated fiber such as the fiber 40
depicted in FIG. 2 is extremely small. In practice, it has been found that handling such
fine fibers and achieving even distribution of them in the final mixture is extremely
difficult. Thus, in accordance with the invention, it is advantageous to utilize fiber
bundles rather than individual fibers as one of the starting components of the mixture.</p><p num="0017">FIG. 3 represents such a bundle 50 of fibers. Each individual fiber in the bundle
is of the type shown in FIG. 2. Such bundles are commonly known and are available
from, for example, a commercial supplier such as Composite Materials Inc., 700
Waverly Avenue, Mamaroneck, New York 10543.</p><p num="0018">Illustratively, the bundle 50 of FIG. 3 comprises approximately 12,000
individual FIG.2-type fibers bonded together. By way of example, the individual fibers
are adhered to each other with a conventional sizing or bonding agent. For the particular
case in which the base elastomer of the inventive mixture comprises SEBS, it is
advantageous to specify a standard styrene-based sizing, thereby to ensure good
compatibility, and intimate mixing in the final mixture, between the fiber bundles and
the thermoplastic base material.</p><p num="0019">In accordance with the invention, the length-to-diameter or aspect ratio of each
individual fiber bundle (such as the bundle 50 of FIG. 3) is selected to achieve
maximum electrical conductivity when the individual fibers are subsequently dispersed
throughout the final mixture. Thus, for example, in one specific illustrative case, the
diameter D2 and the length L1 of the bundle represented in FIG. 3 are designed to be
about 0.23-to-0.25 cm and 0.51-to-0.64 cm, respectively.</p><p num="0020">Accordingly, commercially available fiber bundles of the type represented in
FIG. 3 are advantageously cut up to provide bundle segments having the advantageous
aspect ratio specified above. As a result, when the bundles are disassembled and the
individual coated fibers are dispersed throughout the final mixture, there will inevitably
be multiple contact points among the fibers. This ensures that the mixture will exhibit a
relatively high electrical conductivity.</p><p num="0021">The third component required to form the inventive mixture comprises a fire-retardant
material. One specific illustrative such material suitable for inclusion in the 
mixture comprises a commonly known material such as antimony trioxide, which is
readily available in, for example, powder form from a commercial supplier such as
Laurel Industries Inc., 30,000 Chagrin Boulevard, Cleveland, Ohio 44124. Other fire-retardants
such as alumina trihydrates and brominated organics are feasible substitutes.</p><p num="0022">In accordance with the invention, the three above-specified individual
component materials are mixed together. Advantageously, in this mixture the fiber-bundle
segments comprise about 5-to-25 per cent by volume of the total mixture, the
fire-retardant material comprises approximately 10-to-20 per cent by volume and the
remaining volume comprises the base elastomer thermoplastic material.</p><p num="0023">Illustratively, mixing of the three components is carried out in a conventional
single- or twin-screw extruder. Advantageously, the fiber-bundle segments are not
introduced into the extruder stream at the beginning thereof but rather at a later
intermediate point. In practice, for each particular extruder, it is an easy matter to
determine a suitable intermediate point at which introduced fiber-bundle segments are
partially dispersed while suffering little if any fiber breakage due to heat and/or
mechanical motion during the remaining extrusion process.</p><p num="0024">In the particular illustrative aforespecified mixing process, the extruder provides
at its output pellets that each include the three noted components. By way of example,
each such pellet provided by the extruder has a diameter of about 0.32 cm and a length
of approximately 0.64-to-0.76 cm. The base elastomer and the fire-retardant materials
are well-distributed throughout each such pellet. But typically, if mixing occurs in a
standard extruder in the manner described above, the fiber-bundle segments are only
partially disassembled and dispersed throughout each pellet. Typically, in each pellet
numerous clumps or fiber-bundle segments remain to be dispersed.</p><p num="0025">By way of a specific illustrative example, the aforespecified pellets provided by
the extruder are then introduced into a conventional injection-molding machine. In the
molding machine, the pellets are liquified and further dispersion of the metal-coated
fibers occurs. Eventually, before actual molding takes place, the fibers are evenly
distributed throughout the liquid mixture, thereby providing a mixture to be molded in
which a contacting matrix of intertwined individual fibers is provided. In that way, a
highly conductive mixture is realized.</p><p num="0026">Subsequently, molding of a plastic part is carried out in the injection-molding
machine. In practice, it has been found that the inventive mixture described herein is 
capable of being molded in a standard machine in a high-speed fabrication process to
form parts having complex geometries. Significantly, the flexible soft-durometer parts
so produced are economical, conductive, fire-retardant and recyclable.</p><p num="0027">Finally, it is to be understood that the various above-described formulations and
techniques are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the present
invention. In accordance with these principles, numerous other modifications and
alternatives may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope
of the present invention. Thus, for example, although primary emphasis above was
illustratively directed to a particular procedure in which the conductive elements of the
inventive mixture were initially only partially dispersed throughout the mixture during
the mixing step in an extruder, and dispersion was completed later during the injection-molding
process, it is apparent that other standard mixing procedures may be employed
for achieving substantially complete dispersion of the conductive elements throughout
the mixture before initiation of the actual molding operation.</p></description><claims lang="EN" status="new"><claim num="xx"><claim-text>A method of making a conductive fire-retardant thermoplastic mixture,
