housings are in a half-fitted state is described in <ref type="patent">JP-9-219257</ref>. In this connector, a male
housing is provided with a hood into which a female housing can be fitted, and a spring means
is housed in a housing member adjacent to the hood. When the two housings are to be fitted
together, the spring means is pressed by the female housing, spring force thereof accumulating
while it is being pressed. If the fitting operation of the two housings is halted part-way
through, the spring force accumulated thus far is released, this pushing the female housing
outwards. By this means, the half-fitted state of the two housings can be detected.</p><p num="0003">The fitting operation of connectors provided with a fitting detecting means is extremely
reliable. It is highly desirable to improve the reliability of the fitting operation of connectors in
general, and it is therefore desirable to provide a fitting detecting means to connectors which
conventionally do not have one. However, it is necessary to design new connectors in order to
realise this, and the cost thereof is high.</p><p num="0004">The present invention has taken the above problem into consideration, and aims to present a
fitting detecting means which can be added to a variety of types of connector.</p><p num="0005"><ref type="patent">US-A-5820399</ref>
which is considered to represent
the closest prior art
discloses a connector comprising two mutually engageable connector housings,
one of which includes an integral housing for a spring biased slider, which is actuated by the
other connector housing to provide detection of incomplete engagement.</p><p num="0006"><ref type="patent">EP-A-1130691</ref> discloses a connector also having an integral housing for a spring biased slider.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0007">According to the invention there is provided a connector comprising two mutually
engageable connector housings and a detecting unit for detecting incomplete
engagement of said housings, said detecting unit having a spring acted on by the other 
of said housings and adapted to accumulate a resilient force during engagement of said
housings, said force tending to move said housings in the direction of separation,
characterized in that said connector is elongate in a direction perpendicular to the
attachment direction of said housings, a detecting unit being provided at each end of
said one of said housings, each detecting unit latching the other of said housings on
complete engagement of said housings, the connector having a lever on one of said
housings, said lever being engageable with the other of said housings and pivotable to
draw said housings into complete engagement, and each of said detecting units being
disengaged from the other of said housings on application of a force to said lever in a
disengaging direction, said force exceeding a predetermined limit, wherein each
detecting unit comprises a body attachable to one of said housings, and a slider housed
in said body for movement relative thereto.</p><p num="0008">The detecting unit preferably includes a slider retained therein and resiliently latchable with
the other of said housings both in the direction of attachment and in the direction of separation
of said housings. In the direction of attachment the slider and other of said housings preferably
have contact faces perpendicular to the attachment direction, whereas in the direction of
separation the contact faces are preferably at an angle to the attachment direction. Such an
arrangement provides a semi-latch which is releasable on application of a predetermined
separation force.</p><p num="0009">An attachable detecting unit has the advantage of being able to be included with the connector
only when required.</p><heading><u style="single">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</u></heading><p num="0010">Other features of the invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred

16. This embodiment is a lever-type connector. As shown in Figure 1, the connector of
this embodiment is provided with a male connector housing 10 that fits with a female
connector housing 20 provided with a lever 25. Detecting units 40 that function as a
fitting detecting means can be attached to the female housing 20. The fitting face sides
of the male and female housings 10 and 20 will hereafter be considered as the anterior
sides.</p><p num="0012">The male housing 10 has a long and narrow shape and is provided with a cylindrical
hood 11 that is open to the anterior. As shown in Figure 2, a plurality of cavities 12 are
aligned in two layers within the male housing 10 along the lengthwise direction thereof.
Each cavity 12 can have a male terminal fitting (not shown) attached therein. A pair of
follower pins 13 protrude from inner faces of the hood 11 at an approximately central
location relative to the lengthwise direction of the male housing 10, these follower pins
13 facing one another. The follower pins 13 can be inserted into cam grooves 28 of the
lever 25 of the female housing 20 (to be described).</p><p num="0013">As shown in Figure 1, the female housing 20 can be fitted into the hood 11 of the male
housing 10 and, like the male housing 10, is long and narrow in shape. As shown in
Figure 3, the female housing 20 has a configuration whereby a lower side face (relative
to Figure 3) of an outer housing 21 thereof has an opening 21A, an inner housing 22
being housed within the female housing 20 from this opening 21A (see Figure 6). As
shown in Figures 3 and 5, a plurality of cavities 23 are aligned within the inner housing
22, the location of these cavities 23 corresponding to the location of the cavities 12 of
the male housing 10. Female terminal fittings are housed within the cavities 23, these
female terminal fittings fitting with the male terminal fittings. As shown in Figure 4, a
maintaining arm 21C provided with a retaining hole 21B is provided on a
circumference edge of the opening 21A of the outer housing 21. When the inner
housing 22 is housed within the outer housing 21, a protrusion 22A formed on the inner
housing 22 engages with the retaining hole 21B, thereby maintaining the inner housing
22 in this location. </p><p num="0014">A pair of axle pins 24, to which the lever 25 is attached, protrude from outer faces of
the outer housing 21. The lever 25 has an inverted-U shape and is formed from a pair
of foot members 26 joined by a joining member 27. The lever 25 is attached pivotably
to the female housing 20 by positioning the two foot members 26 so as to grip the
female housing 20 and fitting the axle pins 24 into attachment holes 26A formed in the
two foot members 26. The lever 25 can be pivoted along the lengthwise direction of the
female housing 20 by pressing the joining member 27, with the axle pins 24 serving as
the pivot centre.</p><p num="0015">The cam grooves 28, into which the follower pins 13 of the male housing 10 are
inserted, are formed in the two foot members 26. As shown in Figure 1, when the lever
25 is in a state prior to being pivoted, an entrance hole 28A of each cam groove 28
faces the anterior. As shown in Figure 11, pivoting the lever 25 after the follower pins
13 have been inserted into the entrance holes 28A of the cam grooves 28 causes the
follower pins 13 to move along the cam grooves 28 and causes the male and female
housings 10 and 20 to fit together. The male and female housings 10 and 20 reach the
correct fitting position when the lever 25 has been pivoted to the position shown in
Figure 14; in this position, an end of the joining member 27 thereof is retained by a
stopping member 29 provided on the female housing 20. As shown in Figure 7, the
stopping member 29 has a cantilevered shape and is capable of bending resiliently into
the female housing 20.</p><p num="0016">Guiding or attachment rails 30 protrude from an innermost side face (relative to Figure
3) of the outer housing 21 and from an outermost side face of the inner housing 22.
That is, as shown in Figure 4, these guiding rails 30 are provided at both lengthwise
ends of the female housing 20, and allow the detecting units 40 to be attached. Each
detecting unit 40 has a configuration whereby a coiled spring 60 and a slider 61 are
housed within a spring holder 41. The detecting units 40 are attached by fitting guiding
members 42, which are provided on the spring holders 41, into the guiding rails 30 of
the female housing 20 (see Figure 10). </p><p num="0017">The attachment configuration of the female housing 20 and the detecting units 40 will
now be explained. As shown in Figure 4, the guiding rails 30 extend in a lengthwise
direction along side faces of the female housing 20 and, as shown in Figure 5, a pair of
flange members 31 protrude in a T-shape upwards and downwards from these guiding
rails 30. As shown in Figure 6, the guiding rails 30 extend from a location slightly back
from an anterior end of the female housing 20 to a posterior end of this female housing
20.</p><p num="0018">As shown in Figure 4, the spring holders 41 are attached along the guiding rails 30 from
the anterior of the female housing 20. The pair of guiding members 42 protrude from
both side edges of a lower face (relative to Figure 8) of each spring holder 41. Guide
grooves 43 are formed in inner edges of the guiding members 42, the flange members
31 of the guiding rails 30 being inserted therein. As shown in Figure 4, protruding
members 44 are formed at anterior ends of the guide grooves 43. As shown in Figure 1,
when the spring holders 41 have been attached to the female housings 20, the
protruding members 44 engage with anterior ends of the flange members 31 of the
guiding rails 30, thereby preventing the spring holders 41 from moving any further
towards the posterior.</p><p num="0019">As shown in Figure 6, a groove 32 extends along the entire length of an outer face of
each guiding rail 30, at a location approximately half-way up this outer face. As shown
in Figure 4, a catching protrusion or obstruction 33 is provided at a location slightly to
the anterior of the centre (relative to the lengthwise direction) of the groove 32. A
projection or stopping protrusion 45 is formed at a central location (relative to the
widthwise direction) of a lower face (relative to Figure 8) of each spring holder 41.
When the spring holders 41 are inserted into the grooves 32 of the guiding rails 30, the
stopping protrusions 45 engage with the catching protrusions 33. As shown in Figure 4,
the stopping protrusions 45 are formed at an approximately central location relative to
the lengthwise direction of the spring holders 41.</p><p num="0020">Tapering guiding faces 34 and 46 are formed on anterior faces of the catching
protrusions 33 and posterior faces of the stopping protrusions 45 respectively. When 
the spring holders 41 are inserted into the grooves 32 while they are being attached, the
guiding faces 34 and 46 guide the stopping protrusions 45 over the catching protrusions
33. As shown in Figure 1, when the spring holders 41 have been attached to the female
housing 20, the stopping protrusions 45 are located directly to the posterior of the
catching protrusions 33, perpendicular faces of the two engaging with one another. By
this means, the spring holders 41 are prevented from moving towards the anterior. At
this juncture, as described above, the protruding members 44 engage with the anterior
ends of the guiding rails 30. Consequently, the detecting units 40 are maintained in a
state where they cannot move towards the anterior or the posterior relative to the female
housing 20. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 5, a recess 35 passes from the anterior to
the posterior of each guiding rail 30 at a location inwards from the groove 32 and
separated therefrom by a wall. These recesses 35 allow the walls of the guiding rails 30
to bend temporarily when the stopping protrusions 45 pass over the catching
protrusions.</p><p num="0021">Next, the configuration of the detecting units 40 will be described in detail. As shown
in Figure 4, the spring holders 41 have an approximately angular cylindrical shape that
is open to the anterior. The coiled springs 60 and then the sliders 61 are housed within
these spring holders 41, being inserted from the anterior via the opening portions
thereof. The sliders 61 are capable of moving in an anterior-posterior direction within
the spring holders 41 along the fitting direction of the male and female housings 10 and
20.</p><p num="0022">The spring holders 41 have outer walls 47 formed opposite the faces that are attached to
the female housing 20, and inner walls 48 are provided therebetween. Spaces between
the inner sides of the inner walls 48 house the coiled springs 60, and spring receiving
walls 49 that restrain posterior ends of the coiled springs 60 are provided at the
posterior ends of the inner walls 48. When the sliders 61 are moved to the posterior,
these spring receiving walls 49 allow the coiled springs 60 to be compressed, the spring
force thereof accumulating. When the sliders 61 are attached in the position shown at
the top of Figure 4, the coiled springs 60 are slightly compressed, and this results in the
sliders 61 being kept positioned towards the anterior. </p><p num="0023">As shown in Figure 8, the coiled springs 60 make contact with the centre (relative to the
widthwise direction thereof) of the sliders 61. Forked holders 62, these maintaining the
centrally located coiled springs 60 in a gripped state, are located at both edges relative
to the widthwise direction of the sliders 61 and extend towards the posterior. A pair of
protrusions 63 are formed on both side faces of the sliders 61. As shown in Figure 4,
these protrusions 63 enter a pair of guiding grooves 50 formed in inner faces of the
spring holders 41 and slide along these guiding grooves 50, thereby guiding the
movement of the sliders 61 in the anterior-posterior direction. Stoppers 51 are formed
at anterior ends of the guiding grooves 50. The protrusions 63 engage with these
stoppers 51, thereby retaining the sliders 61 in the anterior direction. When the sliders
61 are in the position shown at the top of Figure 4, the protrusions 63 are in an engaged
state with the stoppers 51.</p><p num="0024">As shown in Figure 4, cantilever shaped locking arms 64 protrude outwards from
anterior end portions of side faces of the sliders 61, these side faces extending along the
inner walls 48 of the spring holders 41. Anterior portions of the inner walls 48 are cut
away so as to allow the locking arms 64 to enter therein. The locking arms 64 are
provided with arms 65 that extend from base members outwards the posterior and can
be bent along the lengthwise direction of the female housing 20 with the base members
serving as the bending bases. The arms 65 extend along the outer walls 47. Bending
the locking arms 64 causes the arms 65 to move inwards or outwards (see Figure 12).</p><p num="0025">The side faces of the arms 65 that extend along the outer walls 47 are provided with
outwardly protruding locking protrusions 66. These locking protrusions 66 are located
posteriorly with respect to the centre (relative to the lengthwise direction thereof) of the
arms 65. Recessed grooves 52, into which the locking protrusions 66 enter, are formed
in the outer walls 47. These recessed grooves 52 are provided along a specified
distance from the anterior ends of the outer walls 47 and are open at the anterior. As
shown in Figures 1 and 2, locking members 14 protrude inwards at the anterior end of
the hood 11 of the male housing 10. The locking protrusions 66 of the locking arms 64
engage with these locking members 14. A tapered face 15 is formed on a posterior end 
face of each locking member 14, this tapered face 15 joining with the inner face of the
hood 11 and being gently inclined. A tapered face 67 is provided on a posterior face of
each locking protrusion 66 and is inclined at the same angle as the tapered faces 15.
These tapered faces 15 and 67 mutually engage. As shown in Figure 14, if a pulling
force exceeding a specified degree is exerted on the mutually engaged locking arms 64
and locking members 14 so as to move the male and female housings 10 and 20 in a
direction of separation, the locking arms 64 bend while being guided by the tapered
faces 15 and 67, and their engaged state with the locking members 14 is released. That
is, the tapered faces 15 and 67 form a semi-locking configuration.</p><p num="0026">As shown in Figure 11, while the male and female housings 10 and 20 are being fitted
together, the locking members 14 of the male housing 10 enter the recessed grooves 52
in the outer walls 47 of the spring holders 41, and strike against anterior faces of the
locking protrusions 66. When the locking members 14 are in an inserted state within
the recessed grooves 52, inner faces of these locking members 14 form approximately
unified faces with inner faces of the outer walls 47. Anterior faces of the locking
members 14 are at right angles to the fitting direction of the male and female housings
10 and 20, these faces forming pushing members 16 that correspond to the locking
protrusions 66. The anterior faces of the locking protrusions 66, like the pushing
members 16, are at right angles to the fitting direction of the male and female housings
10 and 20. These anterior faces form pushing receiving members 68 that receive the
pushing force from the pushing members 16. Performing the fitting operation of the
male and female housings 10 and 20 while the pushing members 16 make contact with
the pushing receiving members 68 causes an increased pushing force to be exerted on
the pushing receiving members 68, thereby pushing the sliders 61 to the posterior and
compressing the coiled springs 60.</p><p num="0027">As shown in Figures 4 and 8, a pair of movable guiding members 53 is provided at the
posterior end of side walls of each spring holder 41. These movable guiding members
53 adjoin the outer walls 47 at the side faces of the spring holders 41 and protrude to a
location where they form approximately unified faces with edges of the recessed
grooves 52. As shown in Figure 4, anterior faces of the movable guiding members 53 
form arc-shaped faces 54. Posterior end portions of the arms 65 of the locking arms 64
engage with these arc-shaped faces 54. When the sliders 61 are moved towards the
posterior while the posterior end portions of the arms 65 are engaged with the
arc-shaped faces 54, the locking arms 64 bend inwards as they are guided by the
arc-shaped faces 54. The posterior end portions of the arms 65 of the locking arms 64
are rounded so as to be semicircular in shape.</p><p num="0028">The present embodiment is configured as described above. Next, the operation thereof
will be explained. This connector is formed from the separate components of the male
and female housings 10 and 20 and the detecting units 40. Consequently, before
performing the fitting operation of the male and female housings 10 and 20, it must first
be decided whether the fitting detecting means will be required, and consequently
whether the detecting units 40 should be attached.</p><p num="0029">In the case where fitting detecting is not required, the lever 25 is operated to fit the
female housing 20 with the male housing 10 with the detecting units 40 in an
unattached state with the female housing 20 (see Figure 4).</p><p num="0030">In the case where fitting detecting is required, the detecting units 40 are first attached to
the female housing 20, and then the fitting operation of the male and female housings
10 and 20 is performed.</p><p num="0031">As shown in Figure 4, the detecting units 40 are attached to the female housing 20 as
follows: the flange members 31 of the guiding rails 30 are fitted from the anterior of the
female housing 20 into the guide grooves 43 of the spring holders 41, and the detecting
units 40 are pushed in towards the posterior. As the detecting units 40 are being pushed
towards the posterior along the guiding rails 30, the stopping protrusions 45 enter the
grooves 32. Then, as shown in Figure 9, the guiding faces 34 and 46 of the catching
protrusions 33 and the stopping protrusions 45 (the guiding faces 34 and 46 having
been in a state whereby they were making mutual contact) guide one another to bring
the stopping protrusions 45 over the catching protrusions 33 while the detecting units
40 are being moved further towards the posterior. After this, as shown in Figure 1, the 
stopping protrusions 45 are located directly to the posterior of the catching protrusions
33 within the grooves 32, these catching protrusions 33 retaining the stopping
protrusions 45. By this means, the detecting units 40 are prevented from moving to the
anterior relative to the female housing 20. At this juncture, the protruding members 44
of the spring holders 41 are engaged with the anterior ends of the flange members 31 of
the guiding rails 30, thereby preventing the detecting units 40 from moving any further
towards the posterior. That is, the detecting units 40 are attached to the female housing
20 in a state whereby they cannot move to the anterior or the posterior. Furthermore, as
shown in Figure 10, the guiding rails 30 are fitted into the guide grooves 43, thereby
preventing the detecting units 40 from moving in a widthwise direction.</p><p num="0032">Next, the female housing 20, having the detecting units 40 attached thereto, is fitted to
the male housing 10. As shown in Figure 11, the female housing 20 is inserted into the
hood 11 of the male housing 10, the follower pins 13 fitting lightly within the entrance
holes 28A of the cam grooves 28 of the lever 25. At this juncture, the pushing
members 16 of the male housing 10 make contact with the pushing receiving members
68 of the locking protrusions 66. The lever 25 is then pivoted in the direction shown by
the arrow.</p><p num="0033">While the lever 25 is being pivoted, the follower pins 13 move inwards along the cam
grooves 28 and the male and female housings 10 and 20 are brought closer together in
the fitting direction (see Figure 12). The pushing receiving members 68 receive a
greater pushing force from the pushing members 16 while the fitting of the male and
female housings 10 and 20 progresses, this pushing force pushing the sliders 61 towards
the posterior and compressing the coiled springs 60. While the lever 25 is pivoted
further from the state where the posterior end portions of the arms 65 of the locking
arms 64 make contact with the arc-shaped faces 54 of the movable guiding members
53, the sliders 61 move further towards the posterior, the posterior end portions of the
arms 65 being guided by the arc-shaped faces 54 of the movable guiding members 53
and the locking arms 64 bending inwards. As the locking arms 64 bend, the arms 65
provided with the locking protrusions 66 bend inwards, thereby causing the engagement 
of the pushing receiving members 68 with the pushing members 16 to gradually
decrease.</p><p num="0034">If the pivoting of the lever 25 is halted while the male and female housings 10 and 20
are partly fitted together, the accumulated spring force of the coiled springs 60 is
released, thereby separating the male and female housings 10 and 20. By this means it
can be ascertained that the male and female housings 10 and 20 were partly fitted
together. The coiled springs 60 are provided at both lengthwise ends of the male and
female housings 10 and 20. Consequently, the partly fitted housings 10 and 20 separate
smoothly from one another.</p><p num="0035">When the sliders 61 reach the position shown in Figure 13, the locking arms 64 are bent
to a position whereby the pushing receiving members 68 are completely released from
being pushed by the pushing members 16. At this juncture, the posterior end portions
of the arms 65 are no longer guided by the arc-shaped faces 54 of the movable guiding
members 53, inner edges of the movable guiding members 53 face the outer faces of the
arms 65, and the posterior end portions of the arms 65 protrude out from the posterior
of the spring holders 41.</p><p num="0036">The spring force of the compressed coiled springs 60 is released as the pushing state of
the pushing members 16 and the pushing receiving members 68 is released, pushing the
sliders 61 to the anterior. This forward movement of the sliders 61 is guided by the
protrusions 63 sliding within the guiding grooves 50. While the sliders 61 are moving
to the anterior, the locking arms 64, while remaining in a bent state, move so as to pass
along the locking members 14 of the male housing 10. Then, as shown in Figure 14,
the sliders 61 return to their original position and the locking arms 64 return to their
original position, the tapered faces 67 of the locking protrusions 66 being retained by
the tapered faces 15 of the locking members 14. At this juncture, the protrusions 63 of
the sliders 61 engage with the stoppers 51, thereby preventing the sliders 61 from
moving any further towards the anterior. Furthermore, the coiled springs 60 have
regained their original length (their length prior to fitting), thereby avoiding set-in
fatigue. </p><p num="0037">At approximately the same time, the joining members 27 of the lever 25 causes the
stopping member 29 to bend resiliently, and the joining member 27 rises over it (see
Figure 13). When the lever 25 is pivoted to the position shown in Figure 14, it is
retained by the stopping member 29 which has returned to the end of the joining
member 27 (see Figure 15). By this means, the lever 25 is maintained in a locked state.
At this juncture, the male and female housings 10 and 20 are at the correct fitting depth
(see Figure 14). The lever 25 is retained by the stopping member 29 while the follower
pins 13 are in a fitting state within the cam grooves 28, and the locking arms 64
provided at both lengthwise ends of the male and female housings 10 and 20 are
retained by the locking members 14, this maintaining the male and female housings 10
and 20 in a correct fitting state. In this manner, both lengthwise ends of the male and
female housings 10 and 20 are maintained and, while the male and female housings 10
and 20 are in the fitting state, instability and slippage to the anterior or posterior,
relative to the lengthwise direction thereof, is prevented.</p><p num="0038">If the male and female housings 10 and 20 are to be separated for maintenance or the
like, the joining member 27 of the lever 25 is released from this retained state while the
stopping member 29 is bent, then the lever 25 is pivoted in the opposite direction to
which it was first rotated. While the lever 25 is being pivoted, the follower pins 13
move along the cam grooves 28 to the entrance holes 28A and the male and female
housings 10 and 20 are moved in a direction of separation. At this juncture, the locking
arms 64 are guided inwards from their retained state with the locking members 14 as
the pulling force increases, being guided by the tapered faces 15 and 67 that fit mutually
together, and as they bend these locking arms 64 are released from their retained state
with the locking members 14 (see Figure 16). By this means, the male and female
housings 10 and 20 are released from the retained state and can be separated by
pivoting the lever 25 further. The locking arms 64 and the locking members 14 form
the semi-locking configuration, and consequently their retained state is released
automatically by pivoting the lever 25. </p><p num="0039">In the embodiment described above, the detecting units 40 are formed as a component
separate from the male and female housings 10 and 20. Consequently, the detecting
means can easily be added when it is required for the connector. Furthermore, the
detecting units 40 are provided at both lengthwise ends of the long and narrow
connector. As a result, fitting resistance at either lengthwise end is prevented when the
male and female housings 10 and 20 are fitted together, and the male and female
housings 10 and 20 can also be separated smoothly.</p><p num="0040">The detecting units 40 are provided with retaining devices. Consequently, the male and
female housings 10 and 20 that have been fitted together can be maintained in a stable
state. Furthermore, the retaining devices of the detecting units 40 have semi-locking
devices. Consequently, the lever 25 merely needs to be pivoted from its retained state
in order to easily separate the male and female housings 10 and 20.</p><p num="0041">In the embodiment described above, the detecting unit is attached to a lever-type
connector. However, the detecting unit may be attached to other types of connectors as
well if the connectors have an attachment configuration for the detecting units. For
example, the detecting unit may be optionally attached to a connector wherein a locking
arm is provided in the central portion (relative to the widthwise direction) of a female
housing, this locking arm engaging with a locking member provided on a male housing.
That is, the same detecting unit may be attached to various types of connector if the
connectors have a common attachment configuration; this increases the universality of
the detecting unit. Consequently, the detecting unit can be produced in bulk, and the
production costs thereof will decrease.</p><p num="0042">The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above with the aid of
figures. For example, the possibilities described below also lie within the technical
range of the present invention. In addition, the present invention may be embodied in
various other ways without deviating from the scope thereof.
<sl><li>(1) In the embodiment described above, the retaining devices of the detecting units
have a semi-locking configuration. However, in the case where the male and female 
housings are to be maintained more stably in the fitting state, a conventional locking
configuration may be employed within perpendicular faces engage with one another.</li><li>(2) In the embodiment described above, the detecting unit is provided with the
retaining devices. However, these retaining devices may be omitted in the case where
locking performed by the lever alone is adequate.</li><li>(3) The detecting units may be attached to the male housing rather than the female housing.</li></sl></p></description><claims lang="DE" status="new"><claim num="xx"><claim-text>Verbinder, umfassend zwei wechselweise in Eingriff bringbare Verbindergehäuse
