 </p><p> Combinations Useful for the Treatment of Neuronal Disorders Field of the Invention The invention relates to combinations of inhibitors of glutaminyl cyclase and prolyl endopeptidase and their use for treating neuronal disorders (e. g., Alzheimer's disease, Down Syndrome, Parkinson disease, Chorea Huntington, pathogenic psychotic conditions, schizophrenia, impaired food intake, sleep-wakefulness, impaired homeostatic regulation of energy metabolism, impaired autonomic function, impaired hormonal balance, impaired regulation, body fluids, hypertension, fever, sleep dysregulation, anorexia, anxiety related disorders including depression, seizures including epilepsy, drug withdrawal and alcoholism, neurodegenerative disorders including cognitive dysfunction and dementia). </p><p>Background of the Invention Glutaminyl cyclase (QC, EC 2.3. 2.5) catalyzes the intrarnolecular cyclization of N- terminal glutamine residues and N-terminal glutamate residues of peptides and proteins into pyroglutamic acid (pGlu*) liberating ammonia or water, respectively (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Schilling, S. et al. 2004 FEBS Lett 563,191-196</bibl>). A QC was first isolated by Messer from the latex of the tropical plant Carica papaya in 1963 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Messer, M. 1963 Nature 4874,1299</bibl>). 24 years later, a corresponding enzymatic activity was discovered in animal pituitary (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Busby, W. H. J. et al. 1987 J Biol Chem 262,8532-8536</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Fischer, W. H. and Spiess, J. 1987 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 84,3628-3632</bibl>). For the mammalian QC, the conversion of Gln into pGlu by QC could be shown for the precursors of TRH and GnRH (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Busby, W. H. J. et al. 1987 J Biol Chem 262,8532-8536</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Fischer, W. H. and Spiess, J. 1987 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 84, 3628-3632</bibl>). In addition, initial localization experiments of QC revealed a co-localization with its putative products of catalysis in bovine pituitary, further improving the suggested function in peptide hormone synthesis (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bockers, T. M. et al. 1995 J Neuroendocrinol 7, 445-453</bibl>). In contrast, the physiological function of the plant QC is less clear. In case of the enzyme from C. papaya, a role in the plant defense against pathogenic microorganisms was suggested (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">El Moussaoui, A. et al. 2001 Cell Mol Life Sci 58,556-570</bibl>). Putative QCs from other plants were identified by sequence comparisons recently (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Dahl, S. W. et al. 2000 Protein Expr Purif 20,27-36</bibl>). The </p> <p> physiological function of these enzymes, however, is still ambiguous. </p><p>The QCs known from plants and animals show a strict specificity for L-Glutamine in the N-terminal position of the substrates and their kinetic behavior was found to obey the Michaelis-Menten equation (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Pohl, T. et al. 1991 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 88,10059- 10063</bibl>; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Consalvo, A. P. et al. 1988 Anal Biochem 175,131-138</bibl> ; <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gololobov, M. Y. et al. 1996 Biol Chem Hoppe Seyler 377,395-398</bibl>). A comparison of the primary structures of the QCs from C. papaya and that of the highly conserved QC from mammals, however, did not reveal any sequence homology (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Dahl, S. W. et al. 2000 Protein Expr Purif 20,27-36</bibl>). Whereas the plant QCs appear to belong to a new enzyme family (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Dahl, S. W. et al. 2000 Protein Expr Purif 20,27-36</bibl>), the mammalian QCs were found to have a pronounced sequence homology to bacterial aminopeptidases (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bateman, R. C. et al. 2001 Biochemistry 40,11246-11250</bibl>), leading to the conclusion that the QCs from plants and animals have different evolutionary origins. </p><p><bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">EP 02 011 349</bibl>.4 discloses polynucleotides encoding insect glutaminyl cyclase, as well as polypeptides encoded thereby. This application further provides host cells comprising expression vectors comprising polynucleotides of the invention. Isolated polypeptides and host cells comprising insect QC are useful in methods of screening for agents that reduce glutaminyl cyclase activity. Such agents are useful as pesticides. </p><p>Peptide bonds linked to proline appear to be relatively resistant to the broad-specificity peptidases (Mentlein, 1988), suggesting that peptidases that hydrolyze peptide bonds containing proline may be important in the metabolism of proline-containing peptides (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Atack, et al., Eur. J. of Pharm. , 205,157-163 (1991)</bibl> ). Prolyl endopeptidase appears to play such a role in the metabolism of biologically active proline containing peptides. </p><p>The enzyme hydrolyzes many biologically active peptides containing proline, such as oxytocin, thyrotropin releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, angiotensin 11, bradykinin, substance P, neurotensin and vasopressin. </p><p>Prolyl endopeptidase acts to degrade active peptides as a carboxy terminal proline cleaving enzyme. Specifically, prolyl endopeptidase acts by hydrolyzing peptide bonds on the carboxy side of proline residues. Prolyl endopeptidase is thought </p> <p> mechanistically to act as a serine protease, cleaving peptide bonds by a mechanism similar to other serine proteases such as a-chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisins. </p><p>Although the enzyme universally acts at peptide bonds containing proline derivatives, the enzyme form appears to vary in different tissue sources, wherein the enzyme shows differences in substrate specificity. Prolyl endopeptidase has been purified from a number of plant (carrots, mushrooms), microbial (Flavobacterium menigosepticum) and animal tissues. In animals, the enzyme is found ubiquitously throughout the body, however, prolyl endopeptidase is generally found in highest concentrations within the CNS (Wilk, 1983). Common sources of the enzyme for testing substrates against animal sources have been bovine, rat, and mouse brain. </p><p>Low molecular weight inhibitors of prolyl endopeptidase have been studied. These inhibitors are generally chemical derivatives of proline or small peptides containing terminal prolines. Benzyloxycarbonyl-prolyl-prolinal has been shown to be a specific transition state inhibitor of the enzyme (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Wilk, S. and Orloeski, M. , J. Neurochem. , 41, 69 (1983)</bibl>, <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Friedman, et al., Neurochem. , 42,237 (1984)</bibl> ). N-terminal substitutions of Lproline or L-prolylpyrrolidine (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Atack, et al., Eur. J. of Pharm. , 205,157-163 (1991)</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">JP 03 56,460</bibl>, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">EP 384,341</bibl>), as well as variations of N-benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) dipeptides containing prolinal at the carboxy terminus have been synthesized as prolyl endopeptidase inhibitors (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nishikata, et al., Chem.

Letts., 1 (11), 585-590 (1991)</bibl>). </p><p>Thioproline, thiazolidine, and oxopyrrolidine substitutions of the core structure have been reported to inhibit prolyl endopeptidase (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Tsuru, et al., J.

Similarly, various modifications of the carboxy terminal proline have been made, including various fluorinated ketone derivatives (Henning, <bibl type="patent" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">EP 4,912, 127</bibl>). </p><p>General syntheses of fluorinated ketone derivatives has been described (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Angelastro, M. R. , et al., Tetrahedron Letters 33 (23), 3265-3268 (1992)</bibl> ). Other compounds such as chloromethyl ketone derivatives of acyl-proline or acylpeptide-proline (Z-Gly-Pro- CH2CI) have been demonstrated to inhibit the enzyme by alkylating the enzyme's active site (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Yoshimoto, T. , et al., Biochemistry 16,2942 (1977)</bibl> ). </p><p>EP-A-0 286 928 discloses 2-acylpyrrolidine derivatives useful as propyl endopeptidase inhibitors. </p> <p> Further known prolyl endopeptidase inhibitors are, e. g.

All determinations ere carried out at 30 C. </p><p>Figure 13: A) Western blot analysis of PEP in cellular extracts of different cell lines normalized for actin content. PEP protein was detected by PEP-specific polyclonal antibody S449 (probiodrug, 1: 400) using 10, ug total protein/lane. The highest protein concentration for PEP was found in U-343 cells, followed by SH-SY5Y cells. All other cell types analysed displayed a significantly lower PEP content. In rat brain primary cultures, the highest PEP protein content was detected in neurons, followed by astrocytes, microglial cells and oligodendroglial cells. </p><p> B) Quantification of PEP enzymatic activity in human cell lines and in rat primary neuronal and glial cells as indicated.

The separated cell fractions CE (crude extract), P1 (nucleus fraction), P20 (lysosomal fraction), P100 (microsomal fraction) and S100 (soluble cytosolic fraction) were screened for PEP activity as indicated. Nearly 100 % of the total specific PEP activity in the CE was detected in the S100 fraction of both cell lines investigated. Only small traces of PEP activity were measured in the particular fractions P20 and P100 as well in the nucleus fraction, P1. </p><p>Figure 15 : A) Immunofluorescent labeling of PEP protein in human neuronal and glial cell lines as well in rat primary neuronal and glial cells. Different human cell lines and rat primary cells were labeled with the specific monoclonal PEP antibody 4D4D6 for confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss). In all investigated human cell lines and rat primary cells PEP protein was mainly found in the perinuclear space. In all LN-405 cells as well as in a significant number of SH-SY5Y and U-343 cells, a filamentous, cytoskeleton-like PEP distribution was observed. </p><p> B) Distribution of PEP-EGFP fusion proteins in human cell lines. The human cell lines U-343, SH-SY5Y and LN-405 were transfected with the expression vector pEGFP (Clontech) and with PEP/EGFP fusion constructs pIS-7-MP7 using POLYFECTIN (Biontex) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cultivation for 12 to 24 hours, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS and images were taken by laser scanning microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). As already observed for endogenous PEP distribution, PEP-EGFP fusion protein displayed both, a perinuclear and a filamentous cytoskeleton-like labeling in SH-SY5Y and LN-405 cells. </p><p>Figure 16: A) Co-localization of PEP and tubulin in human glioma cell lines.

In both cell lines used, the intracellular amount of beta-amyloid 1-42 peptides were unaffected. In contrast, the amount of beta-amyloid 1-40 peptides were lowered at 20 % in PEP inhibitor treated U343 and SH-SY5Y cells.

The N-termini of amyloid ss-peptides deposited in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome brain bear pyroglutamic acid. </p><p>The pGlu formation is an important event in the development and progression of the disease, since the modified amyloid p-peptides show an enhanced tendency to (3- amyloid aggregation and toxicity, likely worsening the onset and progression of the disease. (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Russo, C. et al. 2002 J Neurochem 82,1480-1489</bibl>). </p><p>In contrast, in the natural amyloid (3-peptides (3-40/42), glutamic acid is present as an N-terminal amino acid. There was no enzymic conversion of Glu to pGlu known to date. Moreover, spontaneous cyclization of Glu-peptides to pGlu-peptides has not been observed as yet. Therefore one aspect of the present invention was to determine the role of QC in Alzheimer's disease and Down Syndrome. This aspect was addressed by the synthesis of amyloid P-peptide (3-11) and amyloid p-peptide (1-11), containing the amino acid glutamin instead of glutamic acid at position three, the determination of the substrate characteristics of these modified amyloid p-peptides against QC, DP IV and DP IV-like enzymes and aminopeptidases and the use of inhibitors of QC to prevent the formation of pGlu from a N-terminal glutaminyl residue of the amyloid p-derived peptides 1-11 and 3-11. The results are shown in example 8. </p><p>The applied method is described in example 6. </p><p>To date, there are no hints indicating an involvement of QC in the progression of the disease, because glutamic acid is the N-terminal amino acid in amyloid R-peptide (3- 40/42, or 11-40/42) But, QC is the only known enzyme capable of forming pGlu at the N-terminus of peptides. Other aspects of the present invention concern the following findings and discoveries: </p> <p> a) In a side reaction, QC catalyzes the cyclization of glutamic acid to pyroglutamic acid at very low rates, b) Glutamic acid of APP or its subsequently formed amyloid-p-peptides is converted into glutamin post-translationally by an unknown enzymatic activity and in a second step, QC catalyzes the cyclization of glutamin into pyroglutamic acid after processing of the amyloid-P- peptide N-terminus, c) Glutamic acid is converted into glutamine post-translationally by a chemical catalysis or autocatalysis and subsequently, QC catalyzes the cyclization of glutamin to pyroglutamic acid after processing of the amyloid-p-peptide N-terminus, d) There are mutations in the APP gene, which encode the amyloid-p- peptides, leading to Gln instead of Glu in position 3. After translation and processing of the N-terminus, QC catalyzes the cyclization of glutamin to pyroglutamic acid, e) Glutamin is incorporated into the nascent peptide chain of APP, due to a malfunction of an unknown enzymatic activity and subsequently,
QC catalyzes the cyclization of N-terminally glutamine to pyroglutamic acid after processing of the amyloid-p-peptide N-terminus. </p><p>QC is involved in the critical step in all five cases listed above, namely the formation of pyroglutamic acid that favors the aggregation of amyloid (3-peptides. Thus, an inhibition of QC leads to a prevention of the precipitation of the plaque-forming amyloid-p- peptides 3-40/42 or amyloid-p-peptides 11-40/42, causing the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease and Down Syndrome, independently of the mechanism by which cyclization occurs. </p><p>Glutamate is found in positions 3,11 and 22 of the amyloid (3-peptide. Among them the mutation from glutamic acid (E) to glutamin (Q) in position 22 (corresponding to amyloid precursor protein APP 693, Swissprot P05067) has been described as the so called Dutch type cerebroarterial amyloidosis mutation. </p> <p>The ss-amyloid peptides with a pyroglutamic acid residue in position 3,11 and/or 22 have been described to be more cytotoxic and hydrophobic than the amyloid peptides 1-40 (42/43) (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Saido T. C. 2000 Medical Hypotheses 54 (3) : 427-429</bibl>). </p><p>The multiple N-terminal variations can be generated by the p-secretase enzyme 3-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE) at different sites (<bibl next="bibl267" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Huse J. T. et al.  2002 J. Biol. Chem. 277 (18) : 16278-16284</bibl>), and/or by aminopeptidase processing.

Therefore, the peptides Gin-A (3 (1-11) a, Ap (3-11) a, Gln3-Ass (3-11) a, Ap (3-21) a, Gin 3-AP (3-21) a and Gln3-Ass (3-40) as potential substrates of the enzyme were synthesized and investigated. These sequences were chosen for mimicking natural N-terminally and C- terminally truncated GIu3-Ap peptides and Gin 3-Ap peptides which could occur due to posttranslational Glu-amidation. </p><p>In the present invention it was shown that papaya and human QC catalyze both glutaminyl and glutamyl cyclization. Apparently, the primary physiological function of QC is to finish hormone maturation in endocrine cells by glutamin cyclization prior or during the hormone secretion process. Such secretory vesicles are known to be acidic in pH. Thus, a side activity of the enzyme in the narrow pH-range from 5.0 to 7.0 could be its newly discovered glutamyl cyclase activity (Scheme 3) transforming also Glu-AP peptides. However, due to the much slower occurring Glu-cyclization compared to Gln- conversion, it is questionable whether the glutamyl cyclization plays a significant physiological role. In the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders, however, the glutamyl cyclization is of relevance. </p><p>Investigating the pH-dependency of this enzymatic reaction, we found that the unprotonated N-terminus was essential for the cyclization of Gln1-peptides and accordingly that the pKa-value of the substrate was identical to the pKa-value for QC- catalysis (see Figure 12). Thus, QC stabilizes the intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the unprotonated a-amino moiety at the y-carbonyl carbon electrophilically activated by amidation (Scheme 1). </p><p>In contrast to the monovalent charge present on N-terminal glutamin containing peptides, the N-terminal Glu-residue in Glu-containing peptides is predominantly bivalently charged around neutral pH. Glutamate exhibits pKa-values of about 4.2 and 7.5 for the y-carboxylic and for the a-amino moiety, respectively. I. e. at neutral pH and above, although the a-amino nitrogen is in part or fully unprotonated and nucleophilic, the y-carboxylic group is unprotonated, and so exercising no electrophilic carbonyl activity. Hence, intramolecular cyclization is impossible. </p><p>However, in the pH-range of about 5.2-6. 5, between their respective pKa-values, the two functional groups are present both in non-ionized forms, in concentrations of about </p> <p> 1-10% (-NH2) or 10-1% (-COOH) of total N-terminal Glu-containing peptide. As a result, over a mildly acidic pH-range species of N-terminal Glu-peptides are present which carry both groups uncharged, and, therefore, it is possible that QC could stabilize the intermediate of intramolecular cyclization to pGlu-peptide. I. e. if the y- carboxylic group is protonated, the carbonyl carbon is electrophilic enough to allow nucleophilic attack by the unprotonated a-amino group. At this pH the hydroxyl ion functions as a leaving group (Scheme 3). These assumptions are corroborated by the pH-dependence data obtained for the QC catalyzed conversion of Glu-NA (see example 10). In contrast to glutamin conversion of Gin-) 6NA by QC, the pH-optimum of catalysis shifts to the acidic range around pH 6.0, i. e. the pH-range, in which substrate molecule species are simultaneously abundant carrying a protonated P carboxyl and unprotonated a-amino group. Furthermore, the kinetically determined pKa-value of 7.55 0. 02 is in excellent agreement with that of the a-amino group of Glu-, &amp;num;NA, determined by titration (7.57 +0. 05). </p><p>Physiologically, at pH 6.0 the second-order rate constant (or specificity constant, kCat/KM) of the QC-catalyzed glutamate cyclization might be in the range of 8, 000fold slower than the one for glutamin cyclization (Figure 11). However, the nonenzymatic turnover of both model substrates Glu-NA and Gln-ssNA is negligible, being conform with the observed negligible pGlu-peptide formation in the present invention. Hence, for the pGlu-formation by QC an acceleration of at least 108 can be estimated from the ratio of the enzymatic versus non-enzymatic rate constants (comparing the second- order rate constants for the enzyme catalysis with the respective nonenzymatic cyclization first-order rate constants the catalytic proficiency factor is 109-101 M~1 for the Gln-and the Glu-conversion, respectively). The conclusion from these data is, that in vivo only an enzymatic path resulting pGlu-formations seems conceivable. </p><p>Since QC is highly abundant in the brain and taking into account the high turnover rate of 0.9 min~1 recently found for the maturation of 30 uM of (Gln-) TRH-like peptide (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Prokai, L., Prokai-Tatrai, K. , Ouyang, X., Kim, H. S. , Wu, W. M. , Zharikova, A. , and Bodor, N. (1999) J Med Chem 42,4563-4571</bibl>), one can predict a cyclization half-life of about 100 hours for an appropriate glutamate-substrate, similar reaction conditions provided. Moreover, given compartmentalization and localization of brain QC/EC in the secretory pathway, the actual in vivo enzyme and substrate concentrations and reaction conditions might be even more favorable for the enzymatic cyclization in the </p> <p> intact cell. And, if N-terminal Glu is transformed to Gln a much more rapid pGlu- formation mediated by QC could be expected. In vitro, both reactions were suppressed by applying inhibitors of QC/EC-activity (Figures 4,5 and 10). </p><p>In summary, the present invention shows that human QC/EC, which is highly abundant in the brain, is a likely catalyst to the formation of the amyloidogenic plu-ars peptides from Glu-Ap and Gin-Ap precursors which make up more than 50% of the plaque deposits found in Alzheimer's Disease. These findings identify QC/EC as a player in senile plaque formation and thus as a novel drug target in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. </p><p>In a second embodiment of the present invention, it was found that amyloid P-derived peptides are a substrate of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) or DP IV-like enzymes. DP IV or DP IV-like enzymes release a dipeptide from the N-terminus of the modified amyloid p-peptide (1-11) generating amyloid (3-peptide (3-11) with glutamin as the N- terminal amino acid residue. The results are shown in example 7. </p><p>In a third embodiment of the present invention, a combination of inhibitors of DP IV- activity and of inhibitors of QC can be used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Down Syndrome. </p><p>The combined effect of DP IV and/or DP IV-like enzymes and of QC is illustrated as follows : a) DP IV and/or DP IV-like enzymes cleave amyloid (3-peptide (1-40/42), a dipeptide comprising H-Asp-Ala-OH and amyloid p-peptide (3- 
40/42) are released, b) In a side reaction, QC catalyzes the cyclization of glutamic acid to pyroglutamic acid at very low rates, c) Glutamic acid is converted into glutamin at the N-terminus post- translationally by an unknown enzymatic activity and subsequently, 
QC catalyzes the cyclization of glutamin into pyroglutamic acid after processing of the amyloid p-peptide N-terminus, d) Glutamic acid is converted into glutamin post-translationally by a chemical catalysis or autocatalysis and in a second step, QC </p> <p> catalyzes the cyclization of glutamin into pyroglutamic acid after processing of the amyloid p-peptide N-terminus, e) There are mutations in the APP gene, which encode the amyloid protein, leading to Gin instead of Glu in position 3 of Ap, After translation and processing of the N-terminus, QC catalyzes the cyclization of glutamin to pyroglutamic acid, 
Glutamine is incorporated into the nascent peptide chain of APP, due to a malfunction of an unknown enzymatic activity and subsequently, 
QC catalyzes the cyclization of N-terminally glutamin to pyroglutamic acid after processing of the amyloid (3-peptide N-terminus, The N-terminal Gin-exposure to QC-activity can be also triggered by different peptidase activities. Aminopeptidases can remove sequentially Asp and Ala from the N-terminus of amyloid p-peptides (1-40/41/43), thus unmasking amino acid three that is prone to cyclization. Dipeptidyl peptidases, such as DP I, DP II, DP IV, DP 8, DP 9 and DP 10, remove the dipeptide Asp-Ala in one step. Hence, inhibition of aminopeptidase-or dipeptidylpeptidase-activity is useful to prevent the formation of amyloid (3-peptides (3-40/41/43). </p><p>The combined effect of inhibitors of DP IV and/or DP IV-like enzymes and of activity lowering effectors of QC is illustrated in the following way: a) The inhibitors of DP IV and/or DP IV-like enzymes inhibit the conversion of amyloid p-peptide (1-40/42) to amyloid (3-peptide (3- 
40/42). b) An N-terminal exposure of glutamic acid is thereby prevented and no conversion to glutamin, either by enzymatic or by chemical catalysis, subsequently leading to pyroglutamic acid formation, is possible. c) Inhibitors of QC prevent in addition the formation pyroglutamic acid from any residual modified amyloid p-peptide (3-40/42) molecules and those modified amyloid p-peptide (3-40/42) molecules, which are generated by mutations of the APP gene. </p> <p>Prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) is believed to inactivate neuropeptides that are present in the extracellular space. However, the intracellular presence of PEP suggests additional, yet unidentified physiological functions for this enzyme. </p><p>The present invention comprises the following unexpected findings: 
1) PEP is localized to the perinuclear space and to the cytoskeleton of rat primary neuronal and glial cells and human cell lines indicating novel functions for PEP in axonal transport and/or protein secretion. </p><p> 2) In metabolic labeling experiments performed in U-343 and SH-SY5Y cells an increased global protein secretion under conditions of PEP inhibition occurs. </p><p> 3) Among the proteins more abundantly secreted were p-amyloid peptides, which were accumulated in the culture medium. </p><p> 4) In mouse brain PEP was exclusively expressed by neurons and displayed region-and age-specific differences in expression levels. </p><p> 5) In brains of amyloid precursor protein transgenic Tg2576 mice, hippocampal 
PEP activity increased in the pre-plaque phase but not in aged mice with amyloid plaque pathology. </p><p> 6) PEP expression was not detected in activated glial cells surrounding p-amyloid plaques in brains from Tg2576 mice and Alzheimer's disease patients. </p><p>The observations according to the present invention indicate that the reported neuroprotective and cognition-enhancing effects of PEP inhibition might be due to increased protein secretion-including P-amyloid peptides-and are most likely supported by a rise in intracellular IP3 concentrations. </p><p>A further aspect of the present invention considers inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (ACE). ACE inhibitors were shown to increase basal and K+-stimulated brain pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase activity in a dose dependent manner. Because of that, these drugs are able to ameliorate Alzheimer type dementia (ATD) cognitive deficits acting not only facilitating cholinergic transmission but also avoiding the formation of pyroglutamyl-ended amyloid-b-peptides deposition trough the activation of brain pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ramírez-Expósito et al. (2001), European Neuropsychopharmcology 11,381-383</bibl>). A preferred ACE-inhibitor is SDZ ENA 713 </p> <p> (rivastigmine (+)- (S)-N-ethyl-3- [ (1-dimethylamino) ethyl]-N-methylphenylcarbamate hydrogen tartrate. </p><p>Summarizing the facts mentioned above, the enzymes QC, PEP, DP IV/DP IV-like enzymes and pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase are involved in impaired neuronal conditions and are therefore targets for drug development. The specific effect of inhibitors of theses enzymes is shown in table 1. </p><p>Table 1 : Effect of inhibitors of QC, PEP and DP IV/DP IV-like enzymes in neuronal diseases

 More than 50% of all plaque peptides found in Alzheimer, Down Syndrome, Parkinson and Chorea Huntington patients start with pGlu. Such N-terminal pGlu renders the peptides degradation resistent and triggers plaque formation starting with intracellular deposition of, e. g. pGlu-AR 3-40 (42/43), plu-ars 11-40 (42/43) and plu-ars 22- </p> <p> 40 (42/43) in neuronal cells in the CNS. The formation and intracellular deposition of these pGlu-containing peptides can efficiently prevented or decreased by either 
1) Inhibition of QC, thereby inhibiting the cyclization of N-terminal glutamin or glutamic acid residues of amyloid p-peptides ; 
2) Inhibition of PEP, thereby increasing the amyloid a-peptide (1-40/42/43) secretion into the extracellular space and thereby preventing QC to act subsequently on on the N-terminally truncated amyloid p-peptide (3-40/42/43) and amyloid (3-peptide (11-40/42/43); or Administration of ACE inhibitors, thereby inhibiting the formation of pyroglutamyl-ended amyloid p-peptides ; or

The APP undergoes different processing pathways. The normal cleavage by the alpha-secretase occurs within the ss-amyloid peptide sequence and results in soluble and non-toxic fragments. </p><p>On the other hand the APP is also hydrolyse by a subsequent action of beta-and gamma-secretases which releases the highly amyloidogenic beta-A4 1-40 or 1-42 peptides. </p><p>In 1999 and 2000 two aspartic proteases BACE1 and BACE2 (Memapsin-2 and-1) were identified which are capable to cleave APP at the beta-secretase site (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Vassar R. et al. 1999 Science 286 (5440): 735-741</bibl>, <bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Acquati F. et al. 2000 FEBS Lett 468 (1): 59- 64</bibl>). Especially when the so called Swedish mutation (K670M671- NL) is present APP is 50fold better substrate for BACE1 (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Grueninger-Leitch F. et al. 2002 J Biol Chem 277 (7): 4687-4693</bibl>). Furthermore also cysteine proteases are in discussion as potential candidates for beta site cleavage (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hook V. Y. et al. 2002 J Neurochem. 81 (2): 237-256</bibl>). After release of ss-amyloid peptide (1-40/42) the peptide can be attacked by aminopeptidases or dipeptidyl aminopeptidases resulting in the formation of ss- amyloid peptide (3-40/42) with an N-terminal glutamyl residue. </p><p>As demonstrated above, the N-terminal glutamyl residue of ss-amyloid peptide (3- 40/42) is accepted by glutaminyl cyclase which catalyzes its cyclization producing an N-terminal pyroglutamate residue. This pGl U3~p-amyloid peptide (3-40/42) is characterized by an increased proteolytic stability to aminopeptidases and by an enhancement of its amyloidogenic properties. </p><p>Spontaneous formation of an iso-aspartyl (isoAsp) or D-aspartyl (D-Asp) residues from intra-protein asparaginyl (Asn) or aspartyl (Asp) residues, which is a common process during aging of proteins can take place at position 672 of the APP, which corresponds to position 1 of the ss-amyloid peptides. ss-amyloid peptides containing an N-terminal isoAsp were indeed determined in the plaques of Alzheimer patients (<bibl next="bibl270" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Shimizu T. et al. 2000 Arch Biochem Biophys 381 (2): 225-234</bibl>). </p><p>As a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is first experimental evidence, that substrates with an isoAsp residue at this position are much more </p> <p> sensitive to beta secretase like cleavage than the corresponding aspartyl containing peptides (Figures 21 and 22). </p><p>Protein isoaspartate carboxymethyl transferase (PIMT) is an enzyme capable to repair the spontaneous formed isoAsp or D-Asp residues inside of an polypeptide chain by methylation of this non-natural amino acids. This methylation results in the rapid formation of a succinimide intermediate which converts by chance either to Asp or isoAsp (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke S. 2003 Ageing Res Rev 2 (3): 263-285</bibl>). Repeated action of PIMT finally leads to a complete repair of the IsoAsp containing peptide chain back to the Asp containing peptides (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Harigaya Y. , T.

In summary all combinations of compounds preventing a single step in the cascade of pGlu3-ss-amyloid peptide (3-40/42) formation are useful for treatment of Alzheimer disease. Such combinations include, e. g. </p><p> 1. inhibitors of QC activity to prevent the formation of the N-terminal pGlu from ss- amyloid peptides (3-40/42), 
2. PIMT enhancers to repair the aged APP, 
3. inhibitors of beta-secretases including but not restricted to BACE1, BACE2 and cysteine proteases, and inhibitors of gamma-secretase to prevent formation of ss-amyloid peptides from APP, 
4. inhibitors of aminopeptidases and inhibitors of dipeptidyl aminopeptidases including but not restricted to dipeptiyl peptidase 11 dipeptiyl peptidase IV to prevent formation of 0-amyloid peptides (3-40/42), and 
5. enhancers of activity of neutral endopeptidase which was found to be capable to cleave soluble ss-amyloid peptides. </p><p>A schematic representation of these combinations is given in scheme 6. The APP is cleaved by beta and/or gamma secretase to p-amyloid peptides (1-40/42). The beta secretase cleavage may be enhanced by formation of isoAsp672. (3-amyloid peptides (1-40/42) are hydrolyse by, e. g. aminopeptidases (AP) or dipeptidyl peptidases (DP) to (3-amyloid peptides (3-40/42) containing an N-terminal Glu residue which can further be processed by glutaminyl cyclase resulting in the formation of the amyloidogenic pGlu3-ss-amyloid peptides (3-40/42).

The problem of the invention especially consists in obtaining locally limited and highly specific inhibition of DP IV or DP IV-analogous activity for the purpose of targeted intervention in the regulation of the activity of locally active substrates. </p><p>This problem is solved according to the invention by the use of the DP IV-inhibitors of the general formula 14 in combination therapy of neuronal disorders: 
EMI73.1
 formula 14 wherein A is an amino acid having at least one functional group in the side chain, B is a chemical compound covalently bound to at least one functional group of the side chain of A, C is a thiazolidine, pyrrolidine, cyanopyrrolidine, hydroxyproline, dehydroproline or piperidine group amide-bonded to A. </p><p>In accordance with a preferred embod ment of the invention, pharmaceutical compositions are used comprising at least one compound of the general formula (6) and at least one customary adjuvant appropriate for the site of action. </p> <p>Preferably A is an a-amino acid, especially a natural a-amino acid having one, two or more functional groups in the side chain, preferably threonine, tyrosine, serine, arginine, lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid or cysteine. </p><p>Preferably B is an oligopeptide having a chain length of up to 20 amino acids, a polyethylene glycol having a molar mass of up to 20 000 g/mol, an optionally substituted organic amine, amide, alcohol, acid or aromatic compound having from 8 to 50 C atoms. </p><p>Despite an extended side chain function, the compounds of formula 14 can still bind to the active centre of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV and analogous enzymes but are no longer actively transported by the peptide transporter PepT1. The resulting reduced or greatly restricted transportability of the compounds according to the invention leads to local or site directed inhibition of DP IV and DP IV-like enzyme activity. </p><p>By extending/expanding the side chain modifications, for example beyond a number of seven carbon atoms, it is accordingly possible to obtain a dramatic reduction in transportability. With increasing spatial size of the side chains, there is a reduction in the transportability of the substances. By spatially and sterically expanding the side chains, for example beyond the atom group size of a monosubstituted phenyl radical, hydroxylamine radical or amino acid residue, it is possible according to the invention to modify or suppress the transportability of the target substances. </p><p>Preferred compounds of formula 14 are compounds, wherein the oligopeptides have chain lengths of from 3 to 15, especially from 4 to 10, amino acids, and/or the polyethylene glycols have molar masses of at least 250 g/mol, preferably of at least 1500 g/mol and up to 15 000 g/mol, and/or the optionally substituted organic amines, amides, alcohols, acids or aromatic compounds have at least 12 C atoms and preferably up to 30 C atoms. </p><p>To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, at least one effector of QC optionally in combination with at least one PEP-inhibitor and/or at least one DP IV- inhibitor and/or at least one NPY-receptor-ligand and/or at least one ACE-inhibitor, can </p> <p> be used as the active ingredient (s). The active ingredient (s) is in mately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration, e. g., oral or parenteral such as intramuscular. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed. Thus, for liquid oral preparations, such as for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like ; for solid oral preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules, gelcaps and tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by standard techniques. For parenterals, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, through other ingredients, for example, for purposes such as aiding solubility or for preservation, may be included. </p><p>Injectable suspensions may also prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e. g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, teaspoonful and the like, an amount of the active ingredient (s) necessary to deliver an effective dose as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e. g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, from about 0.03 mg to 100 mg/kg (preferred 0.1-30 mg/kg) and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.1-300 mg/kg per day (preferred 1-50 mg/kg per day) of each active ingredient or combination thereof. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirement of the patients, the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being employed. The use of either daily administration or post-periodic dosing may be employed. </p><p>Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories; for </p> <p> oral parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e. g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e. g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutical acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformu ation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of each active ingredient or combinations thereof of the present invention. </p><p>The tablets or pills of the compositions of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of material can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate. </p><p>This liquid forms in which the compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, </p> <p> acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin. </p><p>Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their components enantiomers by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-ptoluoyl-d-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-l-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column. </p><p>During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in <bibl next="bibl276" type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J. F. W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973</bibl>; and <bibl type="book" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">T. W. Greene &amp; P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991</bibl>. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using conventional methods known from the art. </p><p>The method of treating neuronal disorders as described in the present invention, may also be carried out using a pharmaceutical composition of at least one effector of QC optionally in combination with at least one with at least one agent, selected from the group consisting of PEP-inhibitors, inhibitors of DP IV/DP IV-like enzymes, NPYreceptor ligands, NPY agonists, NPY antagonists, ACE-inhibitors, PIMT enhancers, inhibitors of beta secretases, inhibitors of gamma secretases and inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase or any other of the compounds as defined herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition may contain between about 0.01 mg and 100 mg, preferably about 5 to 50 mg, of each compound, and may be constituted into any form suitable for the mode of administration selected. </p> <p>Carriers include necessary and inert pharmaceutical excipients, including, but not limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants, sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, and coatings. Compositions suitable for oral administration include solid forms, such as pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each including immediate release, timed release and sustained release formulations), granules, and powders, and liquid forms, such as solutions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions, and suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions. </p><p>Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. </p><p>For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutical acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders; lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or betalactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. </p><p>The liquid forms in suitable flavored suspending or dispersing agents such as the synthetic and natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia, methyl-cellulose and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired. </p><p>Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired. </p> <p> The compounds or combinations of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and rnultilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines. </p><p>Compounds or combinations of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol, polyhydroxyethylaspart- amidephenol, or polyethyl eneoxidepolyllysine substituted with palmitoyl residue. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polyactic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyeric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels. </p><p>Compounds or combinations of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever treatment of the addressed disorders is required. </p><p>The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 0.01 to 1.000 mg per mammal per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100,150, 200,250 and 500 milligrams of each active ingredient or combinations thereof for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg of body weight per day. Preferably, the range is from about 1 to about 50 mg/kg of body weight per day. The compounds or combinations may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day. </p><p>Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of administration, the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and the advancement of </p> <p> disease condition. In addition, factors associated with the particular patient being treated, including patient age, weight, diet and time of administration, will result in the need to adjust dosages. </p><p>Suitably, the particularly beneficial effect on glycaemic control provided by the treatment of the invention is an improved therapeutic ratio for the combination of the invention relative to the therapeutic ratio for one compound of the combination when used alone and at a dose providing an equivalent efficacy to the combination of the invention. </p><p>In a preferred aspect, the particularly beneficial effect on glycaemic control provided by the treatment of the invention is indicated to be a synergistic effect relative to the control expected from the effects of the individual active agents. </p><p>In a further aspect of the invention, combining doses of at least one QC-inhibitor with at least one PEP-inhibitor and/or at least one DP IV-inhibitor and/or at least one NPY- receptor-ligand will produce a greater beneficial effect than can be achieved for either agent alone at a dose twice that used for that agent in the combination. </p><p>In a preferred aspect, the dosage level of each of the active agents when used in accordance with the treatment of the invention will be less than would have been required from a purely additive effect upon the neuronal condition. </p><p>It is also considered that the treatment of the invention will effect an improvement, relative to the individual agents, in decreasing the intracellular deposition of pGlu- amyloid-p-peptides and thereby dramatically slowing down the plaque formation in the brain of a mammal, preferably in human brain. </p><p>In a further aspect, the invention also provides a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one effector of QC optionally in combination with at least one PEP-inhibitor and/or at least one DP IV-inhibitor and/or at least one NPY-receptor-ligand and/or at least one ACE-inhibitor and a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier therefor, which process comprises admixing the </p> <p> QC effector and/or DP IV-inhibitor and/or the PEP-inhibitor and/or the NPY-receptor- ligand and/or the ACE-inhibitor and a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier. </p><p>The compositions are preferably in a unit dosage form in an amount appropriate for the relevant daily dosage. </p><p>Suitable dosages, including especially unit dosages, of the QC-inhibitor, the PEP- inhibitor, the DP IV-inhibitor and the NPY-receptor-ligand include the known dosages including unit doses for these compounds as described or referred to in reference text such as the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) (for example see the 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein) or the above mentioned publications. </p><p>Examples of the invention Example 1: Solid-phase synthesis peptides The peptides used herein were synthesized with an automated synthesizer SYMPHONY (RAININ) using a modified Fmoc-protocol. Cycles were modified by using double coupling from the 15th amino acid from the C-terminus of the peptide with five- fold excess of Fmoc-amino acids and coupling reagent. The peptide coupling were performed by TBTU/NMM-activation using a 0.23 mmol substituted NovaSyn TGR- resin or the corresponding reloaded Wang-resin at 25 pmol scale. The cleavage from the resin was carried out by a cleavage-cocktail consisting of 94.5 % TFA, 2.5 % water, 2.5 % EDT and 1 % TIS. </p><p>Analytical and preparative HPLC were performed by using different gradients on the LiChrograph HPLC system of Merck-Hitachi. The gradients were made up from two solvents : (A) 0. 1 % TFA in H20 and (B) 0.1 % TFA in acetonitrile. Analytical HPLC were performed under the following conditions: solvents were run (1 ml/min) through a 125-4 Nucleosil RP18-column, over a gradient from 5 %-50 % B over 15 min and then up to 95 % B until 20 min, with UV detection (R = 220 nm). Purification of the peptides was carried out by preparative HPLC on either a 250-20 Nucleosil 100 RP8-column or </p> <p> a 250-10 LiChrospher 300 RP18-column (flow rate 6 ml/min, 220 nm) under various conditions depending on peptide chain length. </p><p>For the identification of the peptides and peptide analogues, laser desorption mass spectrometry was employed using the HP G2025 MALDI-TOF system of Hewlett- Packard. </p><p>Example 2: Determination of IC50-values of DP IV-inhibitors 100 pi inhibitor stock solution were mixed with 100 ul buffer (HEPES pH 7.6) and 50 pi substrate (Gly-Pro-pNA, final concentration 0.4 mM) and preincubated at 30 C. </p><p>Reaction was started by addition of 20 lul purified porcine DP IV. Formation of the product pNA was measured at 405 nm over 10 min using the HTS 7000Plus plate reader (Perkin Elmer) and slopes were calculated. The final inhibitor concentrations ranged between 1 mM and 30 nM. </p><p>For calculation of IC50-values GraFit 4.0. 13 (Erithacus Software) was used. </p><p>Example 3: Determination of Ksi-values of DP IV-inhibitors For determination of the Kj-values DP IV activity was measured in the same way as described in example 2 atfinal substrate concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mM and further 7 inhibitor concentrations covering the C5o concentration. Calculations were performed using the GraFit Software. </p><p>Example 4: Prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) enzymatic activity assays The enzymatic activity of PEP was quantified as described recently (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Schulz et al., 2002, Modulation of inositol 1,4, 5-triphosphate concentration by prolyl endopeptidase inhibition. Eur J Biochem 269: 5813-5820</bibl>). Cellular extracts as described above were incubated in the assay buffer using the fluorogenic substrate Z-Gly-Pro-NHMec (10 uM ; Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany) on a spectrofluorimeter SFM 25 (excitation wavelength 380 nm, emission wavelength 460 nm, Kontron, Neufahrn, Germany) equipped with a four-cell changer and controlled by an IBM-compatible personal </p> <p> computer. The data obtained were analyzed with the software FLUCOL (Machleidt et al., 1995). </p><p>Example 5: Assays for glutaminyl cyclase activity Fluorometric assays All measurements were performed with a BioAssay Reader HTS-7000Plus for microplates (Perkin Elmer) at 30 C. QC activity was evaluated fluorometrically using H-Gln-, NA. The samples consisted of 0.2 mM fluorogenic substrate, 0.25 U pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase (Unizyme, Horsholm, Denmark) in 0.2 M Tris/HCI, pH 8.0 containing 20 mM EDTA and an appropriately diluted aliquot of QC in a final volume of 250 ul. Excitation/emission wavelengths were 320/410 nm. The assay reactions were initiated by addition of glutaminyl cyclase. QC activity was determined from a standard curve of naphthylamine under assay conditions. One unit is defined as the amount of QC catalyzing the formation of 1 umol plu-NA from H-Gln- NA per minute under the described conditions. </p><p>In a second fluorometric assay, QC was activity was determined using H-Gln-AMC as substrate. Reactions were carried out at 30 C utilizing the NOVOStar reader for microplates (BMG labtechnologies). The samples consisted of varying concentrations of the fluorogenic substrate, 0.1 U pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase (Qiagen) in 0.05 M Tris/HCI, pH 8.0 containing 5 mM EDTA and an appropriately diluted aliquot of QC in a final volume of 250 pI. Excitation/emission wavelengths were 380/460 nm. The assay reactions were initiated by addition of glutaminyl cyclase. QC activity was determined from a standard curve of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin under assay conditions. The kinetic data were evaluated using GraFit sofware. </p><p>Spectrophotometric assay of QC This novel assay was used to determine the kinetic parameters for most of the QC substrates. QC activity was analyzed spectrophotometrically using a continuous method, that was derived by adapting a previous discontinuous assay (<bibl next="bibl277" type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bateman, R. C. J. 1989 J Neurosci Methods 30,23-28</bibl>) utilizing glutamate dehydrogenase as auxiliary enzyme. Samples consisted of the respective QC substrate, 0.3 mM NADH, 14 mM a-Ketoglutaric acid and 30 U/ml glutamate dehydrogenase in a final volume of </p> <p> 250 ul. Reactions were started by addition of QC and persued by monitoring of the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm for 8-15 min. Typical time courses of product formation are presented in Figure 1. </p><p>The initial velocities were evaluated and the enzymatic activity was determined from a standard curve of ammonia under assay conditions. All samples were measured at 30 C, using either the SPECTRAFluor Plus or the Sunrise (both from TECAN) reader for microplates. Kinetic data was evaluated using GraFit software. </p><p>Inhibitor assay For inhibitor testing, the sample composition was the same as described above, except of the putative inhibitory compound added. For a rapid test of QC-inhibition, samples contained 4 mM of the respective inhibitor and a substrate concentration at 1 KM For detailed investigations of the inhibition and determination of Kj-values, influence of the inhibitor on the auxiliary enzymes was investigated first. In every case, there was no influence on either enzyme detected, thus enabling the reliable determination of the QC inhibition. The inhibitory constant was evaluated by fitting the set of progress curves to the general equation for competitive inhibition using GraFit software. </p><p>Example 6: MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was carried out using the Hewlett-Packard G2025 LD-TOF System with a linear time of flight analyzer. The instrument was equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser, a potential acceleration source (5 kV) and a 1.0 m flight tube. Detector operation was in the positive-ion mode and signals were recorded and filtered using LeCroy 9350M digital storage oscilloscope linked to a personal computer. Samples (5 ul) were mixed with equal volumes of the matrix solution. For matrix solution we used DHAP/DAHC, prepared by solving 30 mg 2', 6'-dihydroxyacetophenone (Aldrich) and 44 mg diammonium hydrogen citrate (Fluka) in 1 ml acetonitrile/0. 1% TFA in water (1/1, v/v). A small volume 1 pl) of the matrix-analyte-mixture was transferred to a probe tip and immediately evaporated in a vacuum chamber (Hewlett-Packard G2024A sample prep accessory) to ensure rapid and homogeneous sample crystallization </p> <p> For long-term testing of Glu1-cyclization, A -derived peptides were incubated in 100psi 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2 or 0.1 M Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.5 at 30 C. Peptides were applied in 0.5 mM [Ap (3-11) a] or 0.15 mM [Ap (3-21) a] concentrations, and 0.2 U QC was added all 24 hours. In case of AP (3-21) a, the assays contained 1 % DMSO. At different times, samples were removed from the assay tube, peptides extracted using ZipTips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, mixed with matrix solution (1: 1 v/v) and subsequently the mass spectra recorded. Negative controls did either contain no QC or heat deactivated enzyme. For the inhibitor studies the sample composition was the same as described above, with exception of the inhibitory compound added (5 mM benzimidazole or 2 mM 1, 10-phenanthroline). </p><p>Example 7: Formation of amyloid (3-peptide (3-40142) derivatives The measurements were carried out with two short N-terminal peptide sequences of amyloid p-peptide (3-40/42), [Gln3]-amyloid -peptide (1-11) (sequence: DAQFRHDSGYE) and [Gln3]-amyloid -peptide (3-11), which contain a glutamin instead of an glutamic acid residue in the third position. Cleavage by DP IV and cyclization of the N-terminal glutamin residue by QC of the two peptides was tested using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Measurements were carried out using purified DP IV (porcine kidney) or crude porcine pituitary homogenate as sources of QC as well as for both enzymes for measurements of consecutive catalysis. </p><p>Results 1. Formation of [Gln3]-amyloid -peptide(3-11) from [Gln3]-amyloid -peptide(1-11) catalysed by DPIV and its prevention by the DP IV-inhibitor Val-Pyrrolidide (Val- 
Pyrr) DPIV or DPIV-like activity is cleaving [Gln3]-amyloid -peptide(1-11) under formation of [Gln3]-amyloid -peptide (3-11) (Figure 2). The residue in the third position is uncovered by this cleavage and becomes therefore accessible for modification by other enzymes, i. e. QC. As expected, catalysis can be completely prevented by Val-Pyrr (Figure 3). </p> <p> 2. Formation of [pGlu3]- amyloid -peptide(3-11) from [Gln3]-amyloid -peptide(3-11) by catalysis of QC in pituitary homogenate and prevention by 1, 10-phenanthroline Glutaminyl cyclase present in the homogenate of porcine pituitary catalyzes conversion of [Gln3]-amyloid -peptide(3-11) to [pGlu3]-amyloid -peptide (3-11) (Figure 4). Formation of pyroglutamyl-amyloid -peptide (3-11) was inhibited by addition of 1, 10-phenanthroline (Figure 5). </p><p>3. Consecutive catalysis of DPIV and QC resulting in formation of [pGlu3]-amyloid - peptide (3-11) and prevention by Val-Pyrrand 1, 10-phenanthroline Formation of [pGlu3]-amyloid -peptide (3-11) from [Gln3]-amyloid -peptide (1-11) takes place after consecutive catalysis by DP IV and QC, measured in crude homogenate of porcine pituitary with added DPIV from porcine kidney (Figure 6). [pGlu3]-amyloid peptide (3-11) was not formed when the QC-inhibitor 1, 10-phenanthroline (Figure 7) or the DP IV-inhibitor Va-Pyrr was added (Figure 8). The slight appearance of [pGlu3]- amyloid -peptide (3-11) is due to aminopeptidase cleavage and following cyclization of the glutamin residue, also indicated by formation of [Gln3-]amyloid -peptide(2-11). </p><p>4. Formation of [pGlu3]-amyloid -peptide (3-11) in crude pituitary homogenate by catalysis of aminopeptidase (s) Due to the formation of [pGlu3]-amyloid -peptide (3-11) that was not dependent on DPIV catalysis, degradation of [Gln3]-amyloid -peptide (1-11) was investigated in crude pituitary homogenate without added DPIV (Figure 9). As expected from the data in section 4, formation of [pGlu3]-amyloid -peptide(3-11) was observed. The data show that the degradation of [Gln3]-amyloid -peptide (1-11) may also be catalyzed by aminopeptidase (s), resulting in [pGlu3]-amyloid -peptide(3-11). Hence, the results show that pyroglutamyl formation is an endpoint of N-terminal peptide degradation in this tissue, further supporting the role of QC in plaque formation. </p><p>Example 8: Turnover of Gln3-Ap peptides 3-1 la ; 3-21 and 3-40 by recombinant human QC </p> <p> All Gin3-Ap derived peptides tested were efficiently converted by human QC into the corresponding pyroglutamyl forms (Table 4). Due to the poor solubility of Gln3-A (3- 21) a and Gln3-A (3-40) in aqueous solution, the determinations were carried out in presence of 1% DMSO. The better solubility of G ! n-Ap (3-11) a, however, allowed the kinetic analysis of the QC-catalyzed turnover in presence and absence of DMSO (Table 4). Taken together, the investigation of the Ap peptides as QC-substrates with chain-length of 8,18 and 37 amino acids (see Table 4) confirmed the observation that human QC-activity increases with the length of its substrates. Accordingly, Gln1- gastrin, Gln1-neurotensin, Gln1-GnRH are among the best QC-substrates taking the specificity constants into account. Similarly, Gln3-A (3-40) and glucagon, the largest QC-substrates investigated thus far, exhibited high second order rate constants (449 mM~1s~1 and 526 mM-1s-1 respectively) even in presence of 1 % DMSO (Table 4). </p><p>Interestingly, the kinetic parameters for the conversion of the investigated amyloid peptides did not change dramatically with increasing size, suggesting only moderate effects of the C-terminal part of Ap on QC catalysis. Therefore, due to better solubility and experimental handling, the further investigations concerning N-terminal aminopeptidase processing of these peptides were performed using the smaller fragments of A , Gln3-A (1-11) a, Gln3-A (3-11) a and Ap (3-11) a. </p><p>Table 4: Kinetic parameters for conversion of N-terminally Gln-containing peptides by recombinant human QC in buffer solution containing 1% DMSO Peptide KM( M) Kcat(s-1) Kcat/KM(mM-1s-1) Gln3-A (3-11)a 87 ~3&amp;num; 55 ~1&amp;num; 632 ~10&amp;num; Gln3-A (3-11) a 155 4 41. 4 0. 4 267 4 Gln3-A (3-21) a 162 12 62 3 383 10 Gln3-A (3-40) 89 10 40 2 449 28 Glucagon (3-29) 19 1 10.0 0. 2 526 17 &amp;num; Determined in absence of DMSO </p> <p> Example 9: Turnover of AP (3-11) a and Ap (3-21) a by recombinant human QC The incubation ofAp (3-11) a and Ap (3-21) a in presence of QC revealed that in contrast to previous work, glutamate-containing peptides can also serve as QC-substrates (Figures 10C and D). The QC-catalyzed formation of pGlu3-A (3-11) a and pGIU3-AD (3- 21) a was investigated at pH 5.2 and 6.5, respectively. If the QC-inhibitor benzimidazole was added to the solution before starting the assay by addition of QC, substrate conversion resulting in pGlu3-A (3-11) a or pGlu3-A (3-21) a was suppressed (Figures 10E and F). If QC was boiled before addition, formation of the pGlu-peptides was negligible (Figures 10A and B). </p><p>Example 10: pH-dependency of the papaya QC-catalyzed cyclization of Glu-NA and Glu-5NA Papaya QC converted Glu-NA in a concentration range up to 2 mM (which was limited by substrate solubility) in accordance with Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Figure 11). Inspection of turnover versus substrate concentration diagrams for the QC- catalyzed conversion of Glu- NA, studied between pH 6.1 and 8.5, revealed that for this Glu-substrate both parameters, KM and kcat, changed in a pH-dependent manner (Figure 11). This is in contrast to the previously described QC-catalyzed glutamin cyclization, for which only changes in KM were observed over the given pH range (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gololobov, M. Y., Song, I., Wang, W., and Bateman, R. C. (1994) Arch Biochem Biophys 309,300-307</bibl>). </p><p>Subsequently, to study the impact of the proton concentration during Glu-and Gln- cyclization, the pH-dependence of cyclization of Glu-NA and Gln-/3NA under first- order rate-law conditions (i. e. substrate concentrations far below KM-values) was investigated (Figure 12). The cyclization of glutamine has a pH-optimum at pH 8.0, in contrast to the cyclization of glutamic acid which showed a pH-optimum of pH 6.0. </p><p>While the specificity constants at the respective pH-optima differ approximately 80, 000-fold, the ratio of QC versus EC activity around pH 6.0, is only about 8,000. </p><p>The nonenzymatic pGlu-formation from Gln-X3NA investigated at pH 6.0, was followed for 4 weeks and revealed a first-order rate constant of 1. 2*10-7 s-1. However, during the </p> <p> same time period, no pGtu-/3NA was formed from Glu-, 6NA, allowing to estimate a limiting rate constant for turnover of 1. 0*10-9 s-'. </p><p>Example 11 : Intracellular distribution of PEP To identify suitable cell lines for planned localization studies, different human glioma and neuronal cell lines as well as rat primary neuronal and glial cells were investigated for PEP expression and activity. In all cell lines and primary cells studied, PEP was detected by Western blotting analysis using the specific polyclonal antibody PEP-S449 (figure 13A). Using an enzymatic assay with the specific substrate Z-Gly-Pro-AMC it was shown, that rat primary neurons exhibited the highest PEP enzymatic activity (figure 13B). Much lower specific activity was detected in primary astrocytes, microglia and oligodendroglial cells (figure 13B). Among the cell lines tested, the U-343 glioma cells and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells displayed the highest specific PEP activities, which were about in the range of primary astrocytes (figure 13B). A 2.5 to 5-fold lower amount of specific PEP activity was detected in the glioma cell lines LN-405, LNZ-308, T98p31 and U138-MG (figure 13B). Therefore, U-343 as well as SH-SY5Y and-in some instances-LN-405 cells were selected for the subsequent experiments described below. </p><p>To reveal the subcellular localization of PEP, different independent methods were used. First, subcellular fractions of human glioma U-343 cells and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells separated by differential centrifugation were characterized by Western blotting analysis using different antibodies against cell compartment-specific marker proteins (figure 14A). PEP protein was found exclusively in the cell crude extract (CE) an in the soluble cytosolic fraction S100, which was confirmed by PEP enzymatic activity assay in individual fractions (figure 14B). In the SH-SY5Y and U-343 cells, approximately 99% and 87% of the total activity was found in the S100 fraction, respectively. Only small traces of PEP activity or no PEP activity were detected in the particular fraction and in the conditioned media, respectively. </p><p>To reveal the intracellular distribution of endogenous PEP protein by immunocytochemistry, the monoclonal PEP antibody 4D4D6 was used. In all cell lines and primary cells investigated, PEP protein was detected. PEP-immunoreactivity was </p> <p> mainly found in the perinuclear space (figure 15A). Additionally, in all LN-405 cells as well as in a significant number of SH-SY5Y and U-343 cells, a typical cytoskeleton-like PEP distribution was observed (figure 15A). Using the human PEP-antisense cell line U-343 (as60) and the human glioma cell line T98p31, the specificity of the used PEP antibody was validated. Both cell types have a remaining PEP activity of lower than 50% as compared to human glioma U-343 cells and displayed an identical PEP staining pattern but significantly reduced PEP immunoreactivity as compared to U-343 cells (see figure 15A for U-343 (as60)). </p><p>To validate this subcellular localization of PEP using a method not based on immunocytochemical detection, PEP-EGFP fusion proteins were employed. PEP wild- type and an inactive PEP-S554A mutant EGFP fusion protein were transformed in U- 343, SH-SY5Y and LN-405 cells. The wild-type EGFP-fusion vector pEGFP-N3 was used as control. After 16 hours, in all transformation samples green fluorescent cells were observed. The overexpression of the wild-type EGFP led to a homogeneous staining of the whole cell body, including the nucleus (figure 15B). In contrast, the wild- type as well as the mutant PEP-EGFP fusion proteins showed an inhomogeneous distribution, mainly with high concentration in the perinuclear space. No differences in the distribution pattern were observed between the wild-type and the mutant PEP- EGFP-fusion protein. However, in all investigated cell lines a appropriate number of cells showed a fibrillary, cytoskeleton-like distribution pattern of the expressed PEP- EGFP-fusion proteins (figure 15B). This distribution pattern corresponds well to the immunocytochemical staining results as shown in figure 15A. In agreement with the activity measurements and the Western-blotting analysis, no secretion of PEP-EGFP- fusion proteins could be detected. </p><p>The overexpression of wild-type and mutant PEP-EGFP-fusion proteins resulted in the death of all transfected cells between 2 weeks. This fact precluded the generation of cell lines stably overexpressing PEP. Concerning both variants of fusion proteins, a large number of transfected cells displayed very strong cytosolic vacuolisation followed by formation of"apoptotic bodies". Additionally, all transfected cells showed no cell division during their short life time duration. In contrast, cells which expressed only the </p> <p> EGFP wild-type protein have a normal proliferation rate and it was possible to maintain stable cell lines. </p><p>The specific fibrillary cytoskeleton-like distribution of PEP was confirmed by the co- localization with tubulin, a main structural component of the cytoskeleton. In comparison to the typical fibrillary cytoskeleton pattern in tubulin-labeled LN-405 cells, a globular tubulin labeling was detected in most of the U-343 cells (figure 16A). This observation is in agreement with the staining patterns for endogenous PEP and for EGFP-PEP in these cells (compare to figures 15A and 15B, respectively). Both fibrilla and globular tubulin staining patterns co-localized almost completely with the corresponding PEP immunoreactivity (figure 16A). </p><p>To further verify the relationship between the cytoskeleton architecture and the localization of PEP, the microtubuli in U-343 and LN-405 cells were depolymerised by nocodazole (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) treatment. In contrast to the co- localization study, non-treated and treated cells were single labeled with monoclonal tubulin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) and PEP (4D4D6) antibody (figure 16B). </p><p>Under these conditions, most of the U-343 cells displayed the typical cytoskeleton structure as observed for LN-405 cells. After the treatment with nocodazole, the fibrillary structures were completely lost in both cell lines. To test the specificity of the nocodazole effect on the microtubuli structures, treated and non-treated cells were labeled with a monoclonal calnexin antibody (1: 100, Stressgen, Victoria, Can. ). We observed that nocodazole treatment had no effect on the distribution pattern of the specific ER-marker protein calnexin (data not shown). </p><p>In similarity to the tubulin labeling, the PEP immunoreactivity was no longer fibrillary after nocodazole treatment (figure 16B). In U-343 cells, after the microtubuli- depolymerisation, tubulin is distributed diffusely over the whole cytoplasm, mainly localized closely to the cellular membrane. In contrast, the PEP protein was found almost exclusively in large cell membrane puffs. In nocodazole-treated LN-405 cells, the tubulin protein was distributed over the whole cell body including the nucleus. The PEP protein was distributed like the tubulin protein, but not in the nucleus. In general, the formation of membrane puffs was considerably less than in U-343 cells. </p> <p>To investigate the role of the enzymatic activity for the localization of PEP, U-343 and LN-405 cells were treated for 24 hours with 5uM of the specific PEP inhibitor, Fmoc- AlaPyrr-CN, and than labeled with the monoclonal PEP and tubulin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) antibodies. The complete inhibition of PEP enzymatic activity did not lead to any change in the tubulin or in the PEP localization pattern compared to non-treated cells. </p><p>Example 12: Effects of PEP inhibition on protein secretion and on p-amyioid distribution To test the effect of PEP inhibition on protein secretion, metabolic labeling experiments were performed under conditions of pharmacological inhibition of PEP activity (<bibl type="journal" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Schulz et al., 2002, Modulation of inositol 1,4, 5-triphosphate concentration by prolyl endopeptidase inhibition. Eur J Biochem 269: 5813-5820</bibl>). </p><p>Inhibition of PEP enzymatic activity resulted in a 2fold (19727%) and 1, 8fold (181+19%) increase in the protein secretion from U-343 and SH-SY5Y cells in a 24 hour period, respectively (figure 17A). Separation of secreted proteins by gel electrophoresis and subsequent detection of radioactive bands demonstrated that increased protein secretion includes many different proteins over a wide molecular weight range. </p><p>Because p-amyloid peptides are among the proteins processed in the secretory pathway and there has been a recent debate on the regulation of APP processing by PEP activity, the experimental system of PEP inhibition was applied to the analyses of P-amyloid secretion in U-343 and SH-SY5Y cells. Completely inhibition of PEP in human U-343 cells resulted in an increase of p-amyloid peptides in the conditioned medium (figure 18). After 24 hours, the amount of a-amyloid 1-40 and 1-42 (8, 61, 2 and 4, 81, 1 pg/ml per 106 cells) was up to 4, 3fold higher than the concentration measured in control samples (2, 70, 7 and 1, 10, 3 pg/ml per 106 cells). Similar but less pronounced alterations in the secreted levels of ss-amyloid peptides 1-40 and 1-42 (3, 60, 6 and 4, 20, 5 pg/ml per 106 cells) were observed in treated SH-SY5Y cells in comparison to non-treated cells (2, 20, 4 and 1, 90, 6 pg/ml per 106 cells). Independent from cell lines used, the intracellular concentration of ss-amyloid 1-42 peptides were </p> <p> unaffected. In contrast, the amount of ss-amyloid 1-40 peptides were lowered at 20 % in PEP inhibitor treated U343 and SH-SY5Y cells (86, 79, 9 and 156, 7+28, 5 pg/g protein) in comparison to non-treated cells (111, 211, 4 and 127, 012, 7 pg/, ug protein). </p><p>Due to the large variance in background levels, decrease in beta-amyloid 1-40 was not significant in SH-SY5Y cells Togehther, the above experiments clearly demonstrate that p-amyloid peptides are among the proteins more abundantly secreted after inhibition of PEP enzymatic activity. </p><p>Example 13: PEP expression in mouse brain To reveal the distribution and the cellular source of PEP in brain, immunohisto chemical labeling using the monoclonal PEP antibody 4D4D6 was performed in coronal mouse brain sections. PEP was primarily expressed by neurons and detected troughout the mouse brain. PEP-immunoreactivity was present in neuronal cytoplasm and axonal and dendritic processes, closely resembling the subcellular localization of PEP in rat primary neurons (figure 19A; compare figure 15A). </p><p>PEP expression in different brain regions was compared by Western blotting analysis and by an enzymatic PEP activity assay. Western blot analysis and densitometric quantification of optical density readings revealed the highest PEP expression in cerebellum of adult (8-months-old) mice and lower PEP expression in parietal cortex and hippocampus. In aged, 17-months-old mice, PEP protein levels were unchanged compared to the adult mice, with the exception of the hippocampus, which demonstrated an up-regulation of PEP expression by about 30% (figure 19B). These results were mirrored by those derived from the quantification of PEP enzymatic activity in different brain regions. In adult mice, the highest PEP activity was detected in cerebellum (16 mU/mg protein), followed by parietal cortex (11 mU/mg protein) and hippocampus (10 mU/mg protein). In aged mice, PEP enzymatic activity significantly increased in hippocampal tissue, but remained unchanged in the other brain regions studied (figure 19C). </p><p>Example 14: PEP expression in human brain In human brain PEP was selectively expressed by neurons as shown by immunohistochemistry. A perinuclear cytoplasmatic labeling and filamentous staining of neurites (figure 20A) was observed. In brain structures affected by p-amytoidt plaque </p> <p> pathology in AD we detected fewer PEP-immunoreactive neurons, which were more intensely stained than in control brain and which appeared to be shrunken (figure 20A). </p><p>In all AD cases investigated, a robust activation of microglial cells and astrocytes was observed in proximity to a-amyloid plaques. However, neither activated microglial cells nor reactive astroyctes expressed PEP as demonstrated by dual immunofluorescent labeling of PEP and glial markers using confocal laser scanning microscopy (figure 20A). </p><p>Total protein levels and enzymatic activity of PEP in parietal cortex were unaltered in AD brain as compared to age-matched control brain specimens (figure 20B and 20C). </p><p>Example 15 : p-secretase assay The p-secretase assay was carried out using the BACE activity assay Kit (Calbiochem Cat. No. 565785) and the fluorescence quenched substrates RE (Edans) EVKMDAEFK (Dabcyl) Ra which corresponds to the wild type sequence of APP; and RE (Edans) EVKMisoDAEFK (Dabcyl) Ra which corresponds to the respective isoAsp form of APP. Cell extracts from SY5Y or U344 cells were prepared using the extraction buffer of the kit. Cell extraction and assay procedure were carried out according the manufacturer's protocol except the used substrate (see above). </p><p>Hydrolysis of the substrate was monitored using a GENiusPro fluorescence microplate reader (TECAN) and excitation and emission wavelength of 340 and 495 nm, respectively. Activity in RFU/min was calculated by linear regression of the linear part of the time-response-curve.</p></description></fulltext-document>
