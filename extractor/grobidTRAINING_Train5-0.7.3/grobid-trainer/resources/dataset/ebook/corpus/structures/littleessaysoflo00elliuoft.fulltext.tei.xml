<other>IN these Essays little, indeed, as I know<lb/> them to be, compared to the magnitude of their<lb/> subjects I have tried to set forth, as clearly as<lb/> I can, certain fundamental principles, together<lb/> with their practical application to the life of our<lb/> time. Some of these principles were stated, more<lb/> briefly and technically, in my larger Studies of<lb/> sex; others were therein implied but only to be<lb/> read between the lines. Here I have expressed<lb/> them in simple language and with some detail. It<lb/> is my hope that in this way they may more surely<lb/> come into the hands of young people, youths and<lb/> girls at the period of adolescence, who have been<lb/> present to my thoughts in all the studies I have<lb/> written of sex because I was myself of that age<lb/> when I first vaguely planned them. I would<lb/> prefer to leave to their judgment the question as<lb/> to whether this book is suitable to be placed in<lb/> the hands of older people. It might only give<lb/> them pain. It is in youth that the questions of<lb/> mature age can alone be settled, if they ever are<lb/> t^ be settled, and unless we begin to think about<lb/></other>

<other>adult problems when we are young all our think<lb/> ing is likely to be in vain. There are but few<lb/> people who are able when youth is over either<lb/> on the one hand to re-mould themselves nearer<lb/> to those facts of Nature and of Society they<lb/> failed to perceive, or had not the courage to<lb/> accept, when they were young, or, on the other<lb/> hand, to mould the facts of the exterior world<lb/> nearer to those of their own true interior world.<lb/> One hesitates to bring home to them too keenly<lb/> what they have missed in life. Yet, let us re<lb/> member, even for those who have missed most,<lb/> there always remains the fortifying and con<lb/> soling thought that they may at least help to<lb/> make the world better for those who come after<lb/> them, and the possibilities of human adjustment<lb/> easier for others than it has been for themselves.<lb/> They must still remain true to their own tradi<lb/> tions. We could not wish it to be otherwise.<lb/> The art of making love and the art of being<lb/> virtuous two aspects of the great art of living<lb/> that are, rightly regarded, harmonious and not<lb/> at variance remain, indeed, when we cease to<lb/> misunderstand them, essentially the same in all<lb/> ages and among all peoples. Yet, always and<lb/> everywhere, little modifications become neces<lb/> sary, little, yet, like so many little things, im-<lb/></other>

<section>CHAPTER I<lb/> CHILDREN AND PARENTS<lb/></section> 
<other>THE twentieth century, as we know, has fre<lb/> quently been called &quot;the century of the child.&quot;<lb/> When, however, we turn to the books of Ellen<lb/> Key, who has most largely and sympathetically<lb/> taken this point of view, one asks oneself<lb/> whether, after all, the child s century has brought<lb/> much to the child. Ellen Key points out, with<lb/> truth, that, even in our century, parents may for<lb/> the most part be divided into two classes: those<lb/> who act as if their children existed only for their<lb/> benefit, and those who act as if they existed only<lb/> for their children s benefit, the results, she adds,,<lb/> being alike deplorable. For the first group of<lb/> parents tyrannise over the child, seek to destroy<lb/> its individuality, exercise an arbitrary discipline<lb/> too spasmodic to have any of the good effects of<lb/> discipline and would model him into a copy of<lb/> themselves, though really, she adds, it ought to<lb/> </other>

<page_header>LITTLE ESSAYS OF LOVE AND VIRTUE<lb/></page_header> 
<other> pain them very much to see themselves exactly<lb/> copied. The second group of parents may wish<lb/> to model their children not after themselves but<lb/> after their ideals, yet they differ chiefly from the<lb/> first class by their over-indulgence,, by their<lb/> anxiety to pamper the child by yielding to all his<lb/> caprices and artificially protecting him from the<lb/> natural results of those caprices, so that instead<lb/> of learning freedom he has merely acquired self-<lb/> will.,<lb/> These parents do not indeed tyrannise over<lb/> their children but they do worse; they train their<lb/> children to be tyrants. Against these two ten<lb/> dencies of our century Ellen Key declares her<lb/> own Alpha and Omega of the art of education.<lb/> Try to leave the child in peace ; live your own life<lb/> beautifully, nobly, temperately, and in so living<lb/> you will sufficiently teach your children to live.<lb/> It is not my purpose here to consider how far<lb/> this conception of the duty of parents towards<lb/> children is justified, and whether or not peace<lb/> is the best preparation for a world in which<lb/> struggle dominates.<lb/> All these questions about<lb/> education are rather idle.<lb/> There are endless<lb/> theories of education but no agreement concern<lb/> ing the value of any of them, and the whole<lb/> question of education remains open. I am here<lb/> concerned less with the duty of parents in rela<lb/> tion to their children than with the duty of<lb/> children in relation to their parents, &quot;and that<lb/> means that I am not concerned with young chil-<lb/></other>

<other>dren, to whom that duty still presents no serious<lb/> problems, since they have not yet developed a<lb/> personality with self-conscious individual needs.<lb/> Certainly the one attitude must condition the<lb/> other attitude. The reaction of children against<lb/> their parents is the necessary result of the par<lb/> ents action. So that we have to pay some atten<lb/> tion to the character of parental action.<lb/> We cannot expect to find any coherent or<lb/> uniform action on the part .of parents. But there<lb/> have been at different historical periods different<lb/> general tendencies in the attitude of parents to<lb/> wards their children. Thus if we go back four<lb/> or five centuries in English social history we<lb/> seem to find a general attitude which scarcely<lb/> corresponds exactly to either of Ellen Key s two<lb/> groups.<lb/> It seems usually to have been com<lb/> pounded of severity and independence; children<lb/> were first strictly compelled to go their parents<lb/> way and then thrust off to their own way. There<lb/> seems a certain hardness in this method, yet it<lb/> is doubtful whether it can fairly be regarded as<lb/> more unreasonable than either of the two mod<lb/> ern methods deplored by Ellen Key. On the<lb/> contrary it had points for admiration. It was<lb/> primarily a discipline, but it was regarded, as<lb/> any fortifying discipline should be regarded, as<lb/> a preparation for freedom, and it is precisely<lb/> there that the more timid and clinging modern<lb/> way seems to fail.<lb/></other>

<page_header>LITTLE ESSAYS OF LOVE AND VIRTUE<lb/></page_header> 
<other>We clearly see the old method at work in the<lb/> chief source of knowledge concerning old English<lb/> domestic life, the Paston Letters. Here we find<lb/> that at an early age the sons of knights and gentle<lb/> men were sent to serve in the houses of other<lb/> gentlemen : it was here that their education really<lb/> took place, an education not in book knowledge,<lb/> but in knowledge of life. Such education was<lb/> considered so necessary for a youth that a father<lb/> who kept his sons at home was regarded as negli<lb/> gent of his duty to his family. A knowledge of<lb/> the world was a necessary part, indeed the chief<lb/> part, of a youth s training for life. The remark<lb/> able thing is that this applied also to a large extent<lb/> to the daughters. They realised in those days,<lb/> what is only beginning to be realised in ours,*<lb/> that, after all, women live in the world just as<lb/> much, though differently, as men live in the<lb/> world, and that it is quite as necessary for the<lb/> girl as for the boy to be trained to the meaning<lb/> of life.<lb/> Margaret Paston, towards the end of<lb/> the fifteenth century, sent her daughter Ann to<lb/> live in the house of a gentleman w r<lb/> ho, a little later,<lb/></other> 
<page_footnote>* This was illustrated in England when women first began to<lb/> serve on juries. The pretext was frequently brought forward<lb/> that there are certain kinds of cases and of evidence that do<lb/> not concern women or that women ought not to hear. The<lb/> pretext would have been more plausible if it had also been<lb/> argued that there are certain kinds of cases and of evidence<lb/> that men ought not to hear. As a matter of fact, whatever<lb/> frontier there may be in these matters is not of a sexual kind.<lb/> Everything that concerns men ultimately concerns women, and<lb/> everything that concerns women ultimately concerns men.<lb/> Neither women nor men are entitled to claim dispensation.<lb/></page_footnote>

<other>found that he could not keep her as he was pur<lb/> posing- to decrease the size of his household. The<lb/> mother writes to her son : &quot;I shall be fain to send<lb/> for her and with me she shall but lose her time,<lb/> and without she be the better occupied she shall<lb/> oftentimes move me and put me to great unquiet-<lb/> ness.<lb/> Remember what labour I had with your<lb/> sister, therefore do your best to help her forth&quot; ;<lb/> as a result it was planned to send her to a rela<lb/> tive s house in London.<lb/> It is evident that in the fifteenth century in<lb/> England there was a wide prevalence of this<lb/> method of education, which in France, a century<lb/> later, was still regarded as desirable by Mon<lb/> taigne.<lb/> His reason for it is worth noting;<lb/> children should be educated away from home,<lb/> he remarks, in order to acquire hardness, for the<lb/> parents will be too tender to them.<lb/> &quot;It<lb/> is an<lb/> opinion accepted by all that it is not right to bring<lb/> up children in their parents laps, for natural love<lb/> softens and relaxes even the wisest.&quot; *<lb/> In old France indeed the conditions seem sim<lb/> ilar to those in England. The great serio-comic<lb/> novel of Antoine de la Salle, Petit Jean de<lb/> Saintre, shows us in detail the education and<lb/> the adventures, which certainly involved a very<lb/> early introduction to life, of a page in a great<lb/> house in the fifteenth century. We must not<lb/> take everything in this fine comedy too solemnly.<lb/></other>

<other>but in the fourteenth century Book of the Knight<lb/> of the Tour-Landry we may be sure that we<lb/> have at its best the then prevailing view of the<lb/> relation of a father to his tenderly loved daugh<lb/> ters.<lb/> Of harshness and rigour in the relationship<lb/> it is not easy to find traces in this lengthy and<lb/> elaborate book of paternal counsels. But it is<lb/> clear that the father takes seriously .the right of<lb/> a daughter to govern herself and to decide for<lb/> herself between right and wrong. It is his object,<lb/> he tells his girls, &quot;to enable them to govern them<lb/> selves.&quot;<lb/> In this task he assumes that they are<lb/> entitled to full knowledge, and we feel that he<lb/> is not instructing them in the mysteries of that<lb/> knowledge; he is taking for granted, in the advice<lb/> he gives and the stories he tells them, that his<lb/> &quot;young<lb/> and small daughters, not, poor things,<lb/> overburdened with experience,&quot; already possess<lb/> the most precise knowledge of the intimate facts<lb/> of life, and that he may tell them, without turn<lb/> ing a hair, the most outrageous incidents of de<lb/> bauchery. Life already lies naked before them:<lb/> that he assumes ; he is not imparting knowledge,<lb/> he is giving good counsel.*<lb/> * If the Knight went to an extreme in his assumption of his<lb/> daughters knowledge, modern fathers often go to the opposite<lb/> and more foolish extreme of assuming in their daughters an<lb/> ignorance that would be dangerous even if it really existed. In<lb/> A Young Girl s Diary (translated from the German by Eden<lb/> and Cedar Paul), a work that is highly instructive for parents,<lb/> and ought to be painful for many, we find the diarist noting at<lb/> the age of thirteen that she and a girl friend of about the same<lb/> age overheard the father of one of them both well brought up<lb/> and carefully protected, one Catholic and the other Protestant<lb/></other>

<page>19<lb/></page> 
<other>It is clear that this kind of education and this<lb/> attitude towards children must be regarded as<lb/> the outcome of the whole mediaeval method of<lb/> life.<lb/> In a state of society where roughness and<lb/> violence, though not, as we sometimes assume,<lb/> chronic, were yet always liable to be manifested,<lb/> it was necessary for every man and woman to<lb/> be able to face the crudest facts of the world<lb/> and to be able to maintain his or her own rights<lb/> against them. The education that best secured<lb/> that strength and independence was the best<lb/> education and it necessarily involved an element<lb/> of hardness.<lb/> We must go back earlier than<lb/> Montaigne s day, when the conditions were be<lb/> coming mitigated, to see the system working in<lb/> all its vigour.<lb/> The lady of the day of the early thirteenth<lb/> century has been well described by Luchaire in<lb/> his scholarly study of French Society in the time<lb/> of Philip Augustus. She was, he tells us, as<lb/> indeed she had been in the preceding feudal cen<lb/> turies, often what we should nowadays call a<lb/> virago, of violent temperament, with vivid pas<lb/> sions, broken in from childhood to all physical<lb/> exercises, sharing the pleasures and dangers of<lb/> the knights around her. Feudal life, fertile in<lb/> surprises and in risks, demanded even in women<lb/> referring to &quot;those innocent children.&quot; &quot;We did laugh so, WE and<lb/> innocent children!!! What our fathers really think of us; we<lb/> innocent ! ! ! At dinner we did not dare look at one another or<lb/> we should have exploded.&quot; It need scarcely be added that, at<lb/> the same time, they were more innocent than they knew.<lb/></other>

<other>a vigorous temper of soul and body, a masculine<lb/> air, and habits also that were almost virile. She<lb/> accompanied her father or her husband to the<lb/> chase, while in war-time, if she became a widow<lb/> or if her husband was away at the Crusades, she<lb/> was ready, if necessary, to direct the defences<lb/> of the lordship, and in peace time she was not<lb/> afraid of the longest and most dangerous pil<lb/> grimages. She might even go to the Crusades<lb/> on her own account, and, if circumstances re<lb/> quired, conduct a war to come out victoriously.<lb/> We may imagine the robust kind of education<lb/> required to produce people of this quality. But<lb/> as regards the precise way in which parents con<lb/> ducted that education, we have, as Luchaire<lb/> admits, little precise knowledge. It is for the<lb/> most part only indirectly, by reading between the<lb/> lines, that we glean something as to what it was<lb/> considered befitting to inculcate in a good house<lb/> hold, and as what we thus learn is mostly from<lb/> the writings of Churchmen it is doubtless a little<lb/> one-sided. Thus Adam de Perseigne, an ecclesi<lb/> astic, writes to the Countess du Perdue to advise<lb/> her how to live in a Christian manner<lb/> ;<lb/> he coun<lb/> sels her to abstain from playing games of chance<lb/> and chess, not to take pleasure in the indecent<lb/> farces of actors, and to be moderate in dress.<lb/> Then, as ever, preachers expressed their horror<lb/> of the ruinous extravagance of women, their<lb/> false hair, their rouge, and their dresses that<lb/></other>

<other>were too long or too short. They also reprobated<lb/> their love of flirtation. It was, however, in those<lb/> days a young girl s recognised duty, when a<lb/> knight arrived in the household, to exercise the<lb/> rites of hospitality, to disarm him, give him his<lb/> bath, and if necessary massage him to help him<lb/> to go to sleep. It is not surprising that the young<lb/> girl sometimes made love to the knight under<lb/> these circumstances, nor is it surprising that he,<lb/> engaged in an arduous life and trained to disdain<lb/> feminine attractions, often failed to respond.<lb/> It is easy to understand how this state of<lb/> things gradually became transformed into the<lb/> considerably different position of parents and<lb/> child we have known, which doubtless attained<lb/> its climax nearly a century ago. Feudal condi<lb/> tions, with the large households so well adapted<lb/> to act as seminaries for youth, began to decay,<lb/> and as education in such seminaries must have led<lb/> to frequent mischances both for youths and<lb/> maidens who enjoyed the opportunities of edu<lb/> cation there, the regret for their disappearance<lb/> may often have been tempered for parents.<lb/> Schools, colleges, and universities began to spring<lb/> up and develop for one sex, while for the other<lb/> home life grew more intimate, and domestic ties<lb/> closer.<lb/> Montaigne s warning against the undue<lb/> tenderness of a narrow family life no longer<lb/> seemed reasonable, and the family became more<lb/> self-centred and more enclosed. Beneath this,<lb/></other>

<page>22</page> 
<page_header>LITTLE ESSAYS OF LOVE AND VIRTUE<lb/></page_header> 
<other>and more profoundly influential, there was a<lb/> general softening in social respects, and a greater<lb/> expansiveness of affectional relationships, in<lb/> reality or in seeming, within the home, compen<lb/> sating, it may be, the more diffused social feeling<lb/> within a group which characterised the previous<lb/> period.<lb/> So was cultivated that undue tenderness, de<lb/> plored by Montaigne, which we now regard as<lb/> almost normal in family life, and solemnly label,<lb/> if we happen to be psycho-analysts, the CEdipus-<lb/> complex or the Electra-complex. Sexual love is<lb/> closely related to parental love; the tender emo<lb/> tion, which is an intimate part of parental love,<lb/> is also an intimate part of sexual love, and two<lb/> emotions which are each closely related to a third<lb/> emotion cannot fail to become often closely as<lb/> sociated to each other. With a little thought we<lb/> might guess beforehand, even while still in com<lb/> plete ignorance of the matter, that there could<lb/> not fail to be frequently a sexual tinge in the<lb/> affection of a father for his daughter, of a<lb/> mother for her son, of a son for his mother, or<lb/> a daughter for her father. Needless to say, that<lb/> does not mean that there is present any physical<lb/> desire of sex in the narrow sense; that would<lb/> be a perversity, and a rare perversity. We are<lb/> here on another plane than that of crude physical<lb/> desire, and are moving within the sphere of the<lb/> emotions. But such emotions are often strong,<lb/></other>

<other> and all the stronger because conscious of their<lb/> own absolute rectitude and often masked under<lb/> the shape of Duty. Yet when prolonged beyond<lb/> the age of childhood they tend to become a clog<lb/> on development, and a hindrance to a wholesome<lb/> life.<lb/> The child who cherishes such emotion is<lb/> likely to suffer infantile arrest of development,<lb/> and the parent who is so selfish as to continue<lb/> to expend such tenderness on a child who has<lb/> passed the age of childhood, or to demand it, is<lb/> guilty of a serious offence against that child.<lb/> That the intimate family life whicl) sometimes<lb/> resulted<lb/> especially when, as frequently hap<lb/> pened, the seeming mutual devotion was also<lb/> real<lb/> might often be regarded as beautiful and<lb/> almost ideal, it has been customary to repeat with<lb/> an emphasis that in the end has even become<lb/> nauseous.<lb/> For it was usually overlooked that<lb/> the self-centred and enclosed family, even<lb/> when the mutual affection of its members was<lb/> real enough to bear all examination, could<lb/> scarcely be more than partially beautiful, and<lb/> could never be ideal. For the family only repre<lb/> sents one aspect, however important an aspect, of<lb/> a human being s functions and activities. He<lb/> cannot, she cannot, be divorced from the life of<lb/> the social group, and a life is beautiful and ideal,<lb/> or the reverse, only when we have taken into our<lb/> consideration the social as well as the family<lb/> relationship. When the family claims to prevent<lb/></other>

<other>the free association of an adult member of it with<lb/> the larger social organisation, it is claiming that<lb/> the part is greater than the whole, and such a<lb/> claim cannot fail to be morbid and mischievous.<lb/> The old-world method of treating children,<lb/> we know, has long ago been displaced as con<lb/> taining an element of harsh tyranny. But it was<lb/> not perceived, and it seems indeed not even yet<lb/> to be generally recognised, that the system which<lb/> replaced it, and is only now beginning to pass<lb/> away, involved another and more subtle tyranny,<lb/> the more potent because not seemingly harsh.<lb/> Parents no longer whipped their children even<lb/> when grown up, or put them in seclusion, or exer<lb/> cised physical force upon them after they had<lb/> passed childhood. They felt that that would not<lb/> be in harmony with the social customs of a world<lb/> in which ancient feudal notions were dead. But<lb/> they merely replaced the external compulsion<lb/> by an internal compulsion which was much more<lb/> effective.<lb/> It was based on the moral assumption<lb/> of claims and duties which were rarely formu<lb/> lated because parents found it quite easy and<lb/> pleasant to avoid formulating them, and children,<lb/> on the rare occasions when they formulated<lb/> them, usually felt a sense of guilt in challenging<lb/> their validity.<lb/> It was in the nineteenth century<lb/> that this state of things reached its full develop<lb/> ment. The sons of the family were usually able,<lb/> as they grew up, to escape and elude it, although<lb/></other>

<other>they thereby often created an undesirable di<lb/> vorce from the home, and often suffered, as well<lb/> as inflicted, much pain in tearing themselves<lb/> loose from the spiritual bonds especially per<lb/> haps in matters of religion woven by long tradi<lb/> tion to bind them to their parents. It was on the<lb/> daughters that the chief stress fell.<lb/> For the<lb/> working class, indeed, there was often the pos<lb/> sibility of escape into hard labour, if only that<lb/> of marriage. But such escape was not possible,<lb/> immediately or at all, for a large number.<lb/> During the nineteenth century many had been<lb/> so carefully enclosed in invisible cages, they<lb/> had been so well drilled in the reticences and<lb/> the duties and the subserviences that their<lb/> parents silently demanded of them, that we can<lb/> never know all the tragedies that took place.<lb/> In exceptional cases, indeed, they gave a sign.<lb/> When they possessed unusual power of intellect,<lb/> or unusual power of character and will, they suc<lb/> ceeded in breaking loose from their cages, or at<lb/> least in giving expression to themselves. This is<lb/> seen in the stories of nearly all the women<lb/> eminent in life and literature during the nine<lb/> teenth century, from the days of Mary Woll-<lb/> stonecraft onwards.

It<lb/> is only because we recognise that she is a typical<lb/> figure among the women who attained distinc<lb/> tion that we are able to guess at the vast number<lb/> of mute inglorious Elizabeth Barretts who were<lb/> never able to escape by their own efforts and<lb/> never found a Browning to aid them to escape.<lb/> It is sometimes said that those days are long<lb/> past and that young women^ in all the countries<lb/> which we are pleased to called civilised, are now<lb/> emancipated, indeed, rather too much emanci<lb/> pated.

<other>We all know so many happy homes beneath<lb/> whose calm surface this process is working out.<lb/> The parents are deeply attached to their children,<lb/> who still remain children to them even when<lb/> they are grown up.

The parents themselves, though they<lb/> may have forgotten it, often in youth similarly<lb/> revolted against the cherished doctrines of their<lb/> own parents ; it has ever been so, the only differ<lb/> ence being that to-day, probably, the opportuni<lb/> ties for variation are greater. So it comes about<lb/> that what James Hinton said half a century ago<lb/> is often true to-day: &quot;Our happy Christian<lb/> homes are the real dark places of the earth.&quot;<lb/> It is evident that the problem of the relation<lb/> of the child to the parent is still incompletely<lb/> solved even in what we consider our highest<lb/> civilisation.

<other>In the common procreative profusion of those<lb/> forms of life the frequent death of the young<lb/> was a matter of little concern, but biologically<lb/> there was never any sacrifice of the offspring to<lb/> the well-being of the parents. Whenever sacri<lb/> fice is called for it is the, parents who are sacri<lb/> ficed to their offspring.<lb/> In our superior human<lb/> civilisation, in which quantity ever tends to give<lb/> place to quality, the higher value of the indi<lb/> vidual involves an effort to avoid sacrifice which<lb/> sometimes proves worse than abortive. An avian<lb/> philosopher would be unlikely to feel called upon<lb/> to denounce nests as the dark places of the earth,<lb/> and in laying down our human moral laws we<lb/> have always to be aware of forgetting the funda<lb/> mental biological relationship of parent and child<lb/> to which all such moral laws must conform.

There are no maxims, there is only<lb/> an art and a difficult art, to harmonise duties<lb/> which must often conflict. We have to be true<lb/> to all the motives that sanctify our lives. To<lb/> that extent George Eliot s Maggie Tulliver was<lb/> undoubtedly right. But the renunciation of the<lb/> self is not the routine solution of every conflict,<lb/> any more than is the absolute failure to renounce.<lb/> In a certain sense the duty towards the self<lb/> comes before all others, because it is the condition<lb/> on which duties towards others possess any signi<lb/> ficance and worth.

At some<lb/> places and periods it has been considered most<lb/> merciful to put them to death; at others they<lb/> have been almost or quite deified and allowed to<lb/> regulate the whole lives of their descendants.<lb/> Thus in New Caledonia aged parents, it is said<lb/> by Mrs. Hadfield, were formerly taken up to a<lb/> high mountain and left with enough food to last a<lb/> few days; there was at the same time great re<lb/> gard for the aged, as also among the Hottentots<lb/> who asked: &quot;Can you see a parent or a relative<lb/> shaking and freezing under a cold, dreary, heavy,<lb/> useless old age, and not think, in pity of them, of<lb/> putting an end to their misery ?&quot; It was generally<lb/> the opinion of the parents themselves, but in some<lb/> countries the parents have dominated and over<lb/> awed their children to the time of their natural<lb/> death and even beyond, up to the point of ancestor<lb/> worship, as in China, where no man of any age<lb/> can act for himself in the chief matters of life<lb/> during his parents life-time, and to some extent<lb/> in ancient Rome, whence an influence in this<lb/> direction which still exists in the laws and cus<lb/> toms of France.* Both extremes have proved<lb/> compatible with a beautifully human life.

<other>ever, the wisest course.<lb/> There ought to be no<lb/> reason, and under happy conditions there is no<lb/> reason, why the relationship between parent and<lb/> child, as one of mutual affection and care, should<lb/> ever cease to exist.<lb/> But that the relationship<lb/> should continue to exist as a tie is unnatural and<lb/> tends to be harmful. At a certain stage in the<lb/> development of the child the physical tie with the<lb/> parent is severed, and the umbilical cord cut. At<lb/> a later stage in development, when puberty is at<lb/> tained and adolescence is feeling its way towards<lb/> a complete adult maturity, the spiritual tie must<lb/> be severed.<lb/> It is absolutely essential that the<lb/> young spirit should begin to essay its own wings.<lb/> If its energy is not equal to this adventure, then it<lb/> is the part of a truly loving parent to push it over<lb/> the edge of the nest. Of course there are dan<lb/> gers and risks. But the worst dangers and risks<lb/> come of the failure to adventure, of the refusal<lb/> to face the tasks of the world and to assume the<lb/> full function of life. All that Freud has told of<lb/> the paralysing and maiming influence of infan<lb/> tile arrest or regression is here profitable to<lb/> consider. In order, moreover, that the relation<lb/> ship between parents and children may retain its<lb/> early beauty and love, it is essential that it shall<lb/> adapt itself to adult conditions and the absence<lb/> of ties so rendered necessary.

For every fresh stage<lb/> in our lives we need a fresh education, and there<lb/> is no stage for which so little educational prepa<lb/> ration is made as that which follows the repro<lb/> ductive period.<lb/> Yet at no time especially in<lb/> women, who present all the various stages of the<lb/> sexual life in so emphatic a form would educa<lb/> tion be more valuable.

The wise parent realises<lb/> that childhood is simply a preparation for the<lb/> free activities of later life, that the parents exist<lb/> in order to equip children for life and not to<lb/> shelter and protect them from the world into<lb/> which they must be cast.

<other>WE live in a world in which, as we nowadays<lb/> begin to realise, we find two antagonistic streams<lb/> of traditional platitude concerning the question<lb/> of sexual purity, both flowing from the far past.<lb/> The people who embody one of these streams<lb/> of tradition, basing themselves on old-fashioned<lb/> physiology, assume, though they may not always<lb/> assert, that the sexual products are excretions,<lb/> to be dealt with summarily like other excretions.<lb/> That is an ancient view and it was accepted by<lb/> such wise philosophers of old times as Montaigne<lb/> and Sir Thomas More. It had, moreover, the<lb/> hearty support of so eminent a theological au<lb/> thority as Luther, who on this ground preached<lb/> early marriage to men and women alike. It is<lb/> still a popular view, sometimes expressed in the<lb/> crudest terms, and often by people who, not fol<lb/> lowing Luther s example, use it to defend prosti<lb/> tution, though they generally exclude women<lb/> from its operation, as a sex to whom, it fails to<lb/> apply and by whom it is not required.<lb/> But on the other hand we have another stream<lb/> of platitude. On this side there is usually little<lb/></other>

<other>attempt either to deny or to affirm the theory of<lb/> the opposing party, though they would contradict<lb/> its conclusions. Their theory, if they have one,<lb/> would usually seem to be that sexual activity<lb/> is a response to stimulation from without or<lb/> fr*oi within, so that if there is no stimulation<lb/> there will be no sexual manifestation.<lb/> They<lb/> would preach, they tell us, a strenuous ideal ; they<lb/> would set up a wholesome dictate of hygiene.<lb/> The formula put forward on this basis usually<lb/> runs: Continence is not only harmless but bene<lb/> ficial.<lb/> It is a formula which, in one form or<lb/> another, has received apparently enthusiastic<lb/> approval in many quarters, even from distin<lb/> guished physicians. We need not be surprised.<lb/> A proposition so large and general is not easy<lb/> to deny, and is still more difficult to reverse;<lb/> therefore it proves welcome to the people espe<lb/> cially the people occupying public and profes<lb/> sional positions<lb/> who wish to find the path of<lb/> least resistance, under pressure of a vigorous<lb/> section of public opinion. Yet in its vagueness<lb/> the proposition is a little disingenuous; it con<lb/> descends to no definitions and no qualifications;<lb/> it fails even to make clear how it is to be recon<lb/> ciled with any enthusiastic approval of marriage,<lb/> for if continence is beautiful how can marriage<lb/> make it cease to be so?<lb/> Both these streams of feeling, it may be noted,<lb/> sprang from a common source far back in the<lb/></other>

All the emanations of<lb/> the human body,, all the spontaneous manifesta<lb/> tions of its activities, were mysterious and<lb/> ominous to early man, pregnant with terror un<lb/> less met with immense precautions and sur<lb/> rounded by careful ritual. The manifestations<lb/> of sex were the least intelligible and the most<lb/> spontaneous. Therefore the things of sex were<lb/> those that most lent themselves to feelings of<lb/> horror and awe, of impurity and of purity. They<lb/> seemed so highly charged, with magic potency<lb/> that there were no things that men more sought<lb/> to avoid, yet none to which they were impelled<lb/> to give more thought. The manifold echoes of<lb/> that primitive conception of sex, and all the<lb/> violent reactions that were thus evolved and<lb/> eventually bound up with the original impulse,<lb/> compose the streams of tradition that feed our<lb/> modern world in this matter and determine the<lb/> ideas of purity that surround us.<lb/> At the present day the crude theory of the<lb/> sexual impulse held on one side, and the ignorant<lb/> rejection of theory altogether on the other side,<lb/> are beginning to be seen as both alike unjustified.<lb/> We begin to find the grounds for a sounder<lb/> theory.<lb/> Not indeed that the problems of sex,<lb/> which go so deeply into the whole personal and<lb/> social life, can ever be settled exclusively upon<lb/> physiological grounds.

Therewith the immense emphasis placed<lb/> on excretion, and the inevitable reaction that<lb/> emphasis aroused,, both alike disappear.<lb/> The<lb/> sexual protagonists are no longer at the surface<lb/> but within the most secret recesses of the or<lb/> ganism, and they appear to science under the<lb/> name of Hormones or Internal Secretions, al<lb/> ways at work within and never themselves<lb/> condescending to appear at all. Those products<lb/> of the sexual glands which in both sexes are cast<lb/> out of the body, and at an immature stage of<lb/> knowledge appeared to be excretions, are of<lb/> primary reproductive importance, but, as regards<lb/> the sexual constitution of the individual, they<lb/> are of far less importance than the internal secre<lb/> tions of these very same glands. It is, however,<lb/> by no means only the specifically sexual glands<lb/> which thus exert a sexual influence within the<lb/> organism. Other glands in the brain, the throat,<lb/> and the abdomen, such as the thyroid and the<lb/> adrenals,<lb/> are also elaborating fermentative se<lb/> cretions to throw into the system.

<other>play is so elaborate that it is only beginning to<lb/> be understood. Some internal secretions stimu<lb/> late, others inhibit, and the same secretions may<lb/> under different conditions do either. This fact<lb/> is the source of many degrees and varieties of<lb/> energy and formative power in the organism.<lb/> Taken altogether, the internal secretions are the<lb/> forces which build up the man s and woman s dis<lb/> tinctively sexual constitution: the special disposi<lb/> tion and growth of hair, the relative development<lb/> of breasts and pelvis, the characteristic differ<lb/> ences in motor activity, the varying emotional<lb/> desires and needs. It is in the complex play of<lb/> these secretions that we now seek the explanation<lb/> of all the peculiarities of sexual constitution, im<lb/> perfect or one-sided physical and psychic de<lb/> velopment, the various approximations of the<lb/> male to female bodily and emotional disposition,<lb/> of the female to the male, all the numerous<lb/> gradations that occur, naturally as we now see,<lb/> between the complete man and the complete<lb/> woman.<lb/> When we turn the light of this new conception<lb/> on to our old ideas of purity, to the virtue or<lb/> the vice, accordingly as we may have been pleased<lb/> to consider it, of sexual abstinence, we begin<lb/> to see that those ideas need radical revision.<lb/> They appear in a new light, their whole meaning<lb/> is changed.

<other>when we judge them by the crudest criterion,<lb/> that of practice. Thus, while it is the rule for<lb/> physicians to proclaim the advantages of sexual<lb/> continence, there is no good reason to believe<lb/> that they have themselves practised it in any emi<lb/> nent degree. A few years ago an inquiry among<lb/> thirty-five distinguished physicians, chiefly Ger<lb/> man and Russian, showed that they were nearly<lb/> all of opinion that continence is harmless., if not<lb/> beneficial.<lb/> But Meirowsky found by inquiry of<lb/> eighty-six physicians, of much the same nation<lb/> alities, that only one had himself been sexually<lb/> abstinent before marriage. There seem to be no<lb/> similar statistics for the English-speaking coun<lb/> tries, where there exists a greater modesty<lb/> though not perhaps notably less need for it in<lb/> the making of such confessions. But if we turn<lb/> to the allied profession which is strongly on the<lb/> side of sexual abstinence, we find that among<lb/> theological students, as has been shown in the<lb/> United States, while prostitution may be infre<lb/> quent, no temptation is so frequent or so potent,<lb/> and in most cases so irresistible, as that to soli<lb/> tary sexual indulgence. Such is the actual atti<lb/> tude towards the two least ideal forms of sexual<lb/> practice<lb/> as distinguished from mere theory<lb/> on the part of the two professions which most<lb/> definitely pronounce in favour of continence.<lb/> It is necessary, however, as will now be clearer,<lb/> to set our net more widely.

<other>consideration every form and degree of sexual<lb/> manifestation, normal and abnormal, gross and<lb/> ethereal. When we do this, even cautiously and<lb/> without going far afield, sexual abstinence is<lb/> found to be singularly elusive. Rohleder, a care<lb/> ful and conscientious investigator, has asserted<lb/> that such abstinence, in the true and complete<lb/> sense, is absolutely non-existent, the genuine<lb/> cases in which sexual phenomena of some kind<lb/> or other fail to manifest themselves being simply<lb/> cases of inborn lack of sexual sensibility. He<lb/> met, indeed, a few people who seemed exceptions<lb/> to the general rule, but, on better knowledge, he<lb/> found that he was mistaken, and that so far from<lb/> being absent in these people the sexual instinct<lb/> was present even in its crudest shapes. The ac<lb/> tivity of sex is an activity that on the physical<lb/> side is generated by the complex mechanism of<lb/> the ductless glands and displayed in the whole<lb/> organism, physical and psychic, of the individual,<lb/> who cannot abolish that activity, although to<lb/> some extent able to regulate the forms in which<lb/> it is manifested, so that purity cannot be the<lb/> abolition or even the indefinite suspension of<lb/> sexual manifestations; it must be the wise and<lb/> beautiful control of them.<lb/> It is becoming clear that the old platitudes can<lb/> no longer be maintained, and that if we wish to<lb/> improve our morals we must first improve our<lb/> knowledge.<lb/></other>

<other>We have seen that various popular beliefs and<lb/> conventional assumptions concerning the sexual<lb/> impulse can no longer be maintained.<lb/> The<lb/> sexual activities of the organism are not mere<lb/> responses to stimulation, absent if we choose to<lb/> apply no stimulus, never troubling us if we run<lb/> away from them, harmless if we enclose them<lb/> within a high wall. Nor do they constitute a<lb/> mere excretion, or a mere appetite, which we can<lb/> control by a crude system of hygiene and dietet<lb/> ics.<lb/> We better understand the psycho-sexual<lb/> constitution if we regard the motive power be<lb/> hind it as a dynamic energy, produced and main<lb/> tained by a complex mechanism at certain inner<lb/> foci of the body, and realise that whatever<lb/> periodic explosive manifestations may take place<lb/> at the surface, the primary motive source lies in<lb/> the intimate recesses of the organism, while the<lb/> outcome is the whole physical and spiritual<lb/> energy of our being under those aspects which<lb/> are most forcible and most aspiring and even<lb/> most ethereal.<lb/> This conception, we find, is now receiving an<lb/> admirable and beautifully adequate physical<lb/> basis in the researches of distinguished physio<lb/> logists in various lands concerning the parts<lb/> played by the ductless glands of the body, in<lb/> sensitive equilibrium with each other, pouring<lb/> out into the system stimulating and inhibiting<lb/></other>

On the physical side all the characters<lb/> of sexual distinction and all the beauties of<lb/> sexual adornment are wrought by the power<lb/> furnished by the co-operating furnaces of the<lb/> glands, and so also, on the psychic side, are<lb/> emotions and impulses which range from the<lb/> simplest longings for sensual contact to the most<lb/> exalted rapture of union with the Infinite.<lb/> Moreover, there is a certain degree of correla<lb/> tion between the physical and the psychic mani<lb/> festation of sexual energy, and, to some extent.,<lb/> transformation is possible in the embodiment of<lb/> that energy.<lb/> A vague belief in the transformation of sexual<lb/> energy has long been widespread. It is appar<lb/> ently shown in the idea that continence, as an<lb/> economy in the expenditure of sexual force, may<lb/> be practised to aid the physical and mental de<lb/> velopment, while folklore reveals various sayings<lb/> in regard to the supposed influence of sexual<lb/> abstinence in the causation of insanity. There<lb/> is a certain underlying basis of reason in such<lb/> beliefs, though in an unqualified form they<lb/> cannot be accepted, for they take no account of<lb/> the complexity of the factors involved, of the<lb/> difficulty and often impossibility of effecting any<lb/> complete transformation, either in a desirable<lb/></other>

<other>or undesirable direction, and of the serious con<lb/> flict which the process often involves.<lb/> The<lb/> psycho-analysts have helped us here. Whether<lb/> or not we accept their elaborate and often shift<lb/> ing conceptions, they have emphasised and de<lb/> veloped a psychological conception of sexual<lb/> energy and its transformations, before only<lb/> vaguely apprehended, which is now seen to<lb/> harmonise with the modern physiological view.<lb/> The old notion that sexual activity is merely<lb/> a matter of the voluntary exercise, or abstinence<lb/> from exercise, of the reproductive functions of<lb/> adult persons has too long obstructed any clear<lb/> vision of the fact that sexuality, in the wide and<lb/> deep sense, is independent of the developments<lb/> of puberty. This has long been accepted as an<lb/> occasional and therefore abnormal fact, but we<lb/> have to recognise that it is true, almost or quite<lb/> normally, even of early childhood. No doubt<lb/> we must here extend the word &quot;sexuality&quot;<lb/> *<lb/> in<lb/> what may well be considered an illegitimate way<lb/> to cover manifestations which in the usual<lb/> sense are not sexual or are at most called &quot;sexual<lb/> perversions.&quot;<lb/> But this extension has a certain<lb/> justification in view of the fact that these mani<lb/> festations can be seen to be definitely related to<lb/> the ordinary adult forms of sexuality. However<lb/></other> 

<page_footnote>*<lb/> Perhaps, as applied to the period below puberty, it would<lb/> be more exact to say &quot;pseudo-sexuality.&quot; Matsumato has lately<lb/> pointed out the significance of the fact that the interstitial<lb/> testicular tissue, essential to the hormonic function of the testes,<lb/> only becomes active at puberty.<lb/></page_footnote>

<other>we define it, we have to recognise that the child<lb/> takes the same kind of pleasure in those functions<lb/> which are natural to his age as the adult is<lb/> capable of taking in localised sexual functions,<lb/> that he may weave ideas around such functions,<lb/> sometimes cultivate their exercise from love of<lb/> luxury, make them the basis of day-dreams<lb/> which at puberty, when the ideals of adult life<lb/> are ready to capture his sexual energy, he begins<lb/> to grow ashamed of.<lb/> At this stage, indeed, we reach a crucial point,<lb/> though it has usually been overlooked, in the lives<lb/> of boys and girls, more especially those whose<lb/> heredity may have been a little tainted or their<lb/> upbringing a little twisted. For it is here that<lb/> the transformation of energy and the resulting<lb/> possibilities of conflict are wont to enter. In<lb/> the harmoniously developing organism, one may<lb/> say, there is at this period a gradual and easy<lb/> transmutation of the childish pleasurable activi<lb/> ties into adult activities, accompanied perhaps<lb/> by a feeling of shame for the earlier feelings,<lb/> though this quickly passes into a forgetfulness<lb/> which often leads the adult far astray when he<lb/> attempts to understand the psychic life of the<lb/> child.<lb/> The childish manifestations, it must be<lb/> remarked, are not necessarily unwholesome ; they<lb/> probably perform a valuable function and de<lb/> velop budding sexual emotions, just as the petals<lb/></other>

Normally, in<lb/> deed, the adolescent transformations of sex are<lb/> so urgent and so manifold now definite sensual<lb/> desire, now muscular impulses of adventure, now<lb/> emotional aspirations in the sphere of art or re<lb/> ligion<lb/> that they easily overwhelm and absorb<lb/> all its vaguer and more twisted manifestations in<lb/> childhood. Yet it may happen that by some aber<lb/> ration of internal development or of external<lb/> influence this conversion of energy may at one<lb/> point or another fail to be completely effected.<lb/> Then some fragment of infantile sexuality sur<lb/> vives, in rare cases to turn all the adult faculties<lb/> to its service and become reckless and triumph<lb/> ant, in minor and more frequent cases to be<lb/> subordinated and more or less repressed into the<lb/> subconscious sphere by voluntary or even invol<lb/> untary and unconscious effort. Then we may<lb/> have conflict,, which, when it works happily,<lb/> exerts a fortifying and ennobling influence on<lb/> character, when more unhappily a disturbing<lb/> influence which may even lead to conditions of<lb/> definite nervous disorder.<lb/> The process by which this fundamental sexual<lb/> energy is elevated from elementary and primi<lb/> tive forms into complex and developed forms is<lb/> termed sublimation, a term, originally used for<lb/></other>

<other>the process of raising by heat a solid substance<lb/> to the state of vapour, which was applied even<lb/> by such early writers as Drayton and Davies in<lb/> a metaphorical and spiritual sense.*<lb/> In the<lb/> sexual sphere sublimation is of vital importance<lb/> because it comes into question throughout the<lb/> whole of life, and our relation to it must inti<lb/> mately affect our conception of morality. The<lb/> element of athletic asceticism which is a part of<lb/> all virility, and is found even indeed often in a<lb/> high degree among savages, has its main moral<lb/> justification as one aid to sublimation. Through<lb/> out life sublimation acts by transforming some<lb/> part at all events of the creative sexual energy<lb/> from its elementary animal manifestations into<lb/> more highly individual and social manifestations,<lb/> or at all events into finer forms of sexual ac<lb/> tivity, forms that seem to us more beautiful and<lb/> satisfy us more widely. Purity, we thus come<lb/> to see is, in one aspect, the action of sublimation,<lb/> not abolishing sexual activity, but lifting it into<lb/> forms of which our best judgment may approve.<lb/></other> 
<page_footnote>* We may gather the history of the term from the Oxford<lb/> Dictionary.<lb/> Bodies, said Davies, are transformed to spirit &quot;by<lb/> sublimation strange,&quot; and Ben Jonson in Cynthia s Revels spoke<lb/> of a being &quot;sublimated and refined&quot; ; Purchas and Jackson, early<lb/> in the same seventeenth century, referred to religion as &quot;sub<lb/> limating&quot; human nature, and Jeremy Taylor, a little later, to<lb/> &quot;subliming&quot;<lb/> marriage into a sacrament ; Shaf tesbury, early in<lb/> the eighteenth century, spoke of human nature being &quot;sublimated<lb/> by a sort of spiritual chemists&quot; and Welton, a little later, of<lb/> &quot;a<lb/> love sublimate and refined,&quot; while, finally, and altogether in<lb/> our modern sense, Peacock in 1816 in his Headlong Hall re<lb/> ferred to &quot;that enthusiastic sublimation which is the source of<lb/> greatness and energy.&quot;<lb/></page_footnote>

<other>We must not suppose as is too often assumed<lb/> that sublimation can be carried out easily,<lb/> completely, or even with unmixed advantage. If<lb/> it were so, certainly the old-fashioned moralist<lb/> would be confronted by few difficulties, but we<lb/> have ample reason to believe that it is not so. It<lb/> is with sexual energy, well observes Freud, who<lb/> yet attaches great importance to sublimation, as<lb/> it is with heat in our machines: only a certain<lb/> proportion can be transformed into work. Or, as<lb/> it is put by Lowenfeld, who is not a constructive<lb/> philosopher but a careful and cautious medical<lb/> investigator, the advantages of sublimation are<lb/> not received in specially high degree by those<lb/> w r ho permanently deny to their sexual impulse<lb/> every natural direct relief. The celibate Catholic<lb/> clergy, notwithstanding their heroic achieve<lb/> ments in individual cases, can scarcely be said<lb/> to display a conspicuous excess of intellectual<lb/> energy, on the whole, over the n.on-celibate<lb/> Protestant clergy ; or, if we compare the English<lb/> clergy before and after the Protestant Reforma<lb/> tion, though the earlier period may reveal more<lb/> daring and brilliant personages, the whole in<lb/> tellectual output of the later Church may claim<lb/> comparison with that of the earlier Church.<lb/> There are clearly other factors at work besides<lb/> sublimation, and even sublimation may act most<lb/> potently, not when the sexual activities sink or<lb/> are driven into a tame and monotonous subordi-<lb/></other>

<other>nation, but rather when they assume a splendid<lb/> energy which surges into many channels. Yet<lb/> sublimation is a very real influence, not only in<lb/> its more unconscious and profound operations,<lb/> but in its more immediate and temporary appli<lb/> cations, as part of an athletic discipline, acting<lb/> best perhaps when it acts most automatically,<lb/> to utilise the motor energy of the organism in<lb/> the attainment of any high physical or psychic<lb/> achievement.<lb/> We have to realise, however, that these trans<lb/> mutations do not only take place by way of a<lb/> sublimation of sexual energy, but also by way<lb/> of a degradation of that energy. The new form<lb/> of energy produced, that is to say,, may not be<lb/> of a beneficial kind; it may be of a mischievous<lb/> kind, a form of perversion or disease. Sexual<lb/> self-denial, instead of leading to sublimation,<lb/> may lead to nervous disorder when the erotic<lb/> tension, failing to find a natural outlet and not<lb/> sublimated to higher erotic or non-erotic ends<lb/> in the real world, is transmuted into an unreal<lb/> dreamland, thus undergoing what Jung terms<lb/> introversion; while there are also the people<lb/> already referred to, in whom immature childish<lb/> sexuality persists into an adult stage of develop<lb/> ment it is no longer altogether in accord with,<lb/> so that conflict, with various possible trains of<lb/> nervous symptoms, may result.

These<lb/> transformations are to some extent automatic,<lb/> to some extent within the control of personal<lb/> guidance. But there are limits to such guidance,<lb/> for the primitive human personality can never<lb/> be altogether rendered an artificial creature of<lb/> civilisation.<lb/> When these limits are reached the<lb/> transmutation .of sexual energy may become<lb/> useless or even dangerous, and we fail to attain<lb/> the exquisite flower of Purity.<lb/></other>

It has been<lb/> content to preach restraint to man, an abstract<lb/> and meaningless restraint even if it were pos<lb/> sible.<lb/> But when we have regard to the actual<lb/> facts of life, we can no longer place virtue in a<lb/> vacuum. Women are just as apt as men to be<lb/> afflicted by the petty jealousies and narrownesses<lb/> of the crude sexual impulse ; women just as much<lb/> as men need the perpetual sublimation of erotic<lb/> desire into forms of more sincere purity, of<lb/> larger harmony, in gaining which ends all the<lb/> essential ends of morality are alone gained. The<lb/> delicate adjustment of the needs of each sex to<lb/> the needs of the other sex to the end of what<lb/> Chaucer called fine loving, the adjustment of<lb/> the needs of both sexes to the larger ends of fine<lb/> living, may well furnish a perpetual moral dis<lb/> cipline which extends its fortifying influence to<lb/> men and women alike.<lb/> It is this universality of sexual emotion, blend<lb/> ing in its own mighty stream, as is now realised,<lb/> many other currents of emotion, even the par<lb/> ental and the filial, and traceable even in child<lb/> hood, the wide efflorescence of an energy con<lb/> stantly generated by a vital internal mechanism,<lb/> ^-which renders vain all attempts either to sup-<lb/></other>

Even the history of the<lb/> early Christian ascetics in Egypt, as recorded in<lb/> the contemporary Paradise of Palladius, illus<lb/> trates the futility of seeking to quench the un<lb/> quenchable, the flame of fire which is life itself.<lb/> These &quot;athletes of the Lord&quot; were under the<lb/> best possible conditions for the conquest of lust;<lb/> they had been driven into- the solitude of the<lb/> desert by a genuine deeply-felt impulse, they<lb/> could regulate their lives as they would, and they<lb/> possessed an almost inconceivable energy of<lb/> resolution. They were prepared to live on herbs,<lb/> even to eat grass, and to undertake any labour of<lb/> self-denial.<lb/> They were so scrupulous that we<lb/> hear of a holy man who would even efface a<lb/> woman s footprints in the sand lest a brother<lb/> might thereby be led into thoughts of evil. Yet<lb/> they were perpetually tempted to seductive vi<lb/> sions and desires, even after a monastic life of<lb/> forty years, and the women seem to have been<lb/> not less liable to yield to temptation than the men.<lb/> It may be noted that in the most perfect saints<lb/> there has not always been a complete suppres<lb/> sion of the sexual impulse even on the normal<lb/> plane, nor even, in some cases, the attempt at<lb/> such complete suppression.

Even in the eleventh<lb/> century we find that the charming and saintly<lb/> Robert of Arbrissel, founder of the order of<lb/> Fontevrault, would often sleep with his nuns,<lb/> notwithstanding the remonstrances of pious<lb/> friends who thought he was displaying too heroic<lb/> a manifestation of continence, failing to under<lb/> stand that he was effecting a sweet compromise<lb/> with continence. If, moreover, we consider the<lb/> rarest and finest of the saints we usually find<lb/> that in their early lives there was a period of<lb/> full expansion of the organic activities in which<lb/> all the natural impulses had full play. This was<lb/> the case with the two greatest and most influen<lb/> tial saints of the Christian Church, St. Augus<lb/> tine and St. Francis of Assisi, absolutely unlike as<lb/> they were in most other respects. Sublimation,<lb/> we see again and again, is limited, and the best<lb/> developments of the spiritual life are not likely<lb/> to come about by the rigid attempt to obtain a<lb/> complete transmutation of sexual energy.<lb/> The old notion that any strict attempt to ad<lb/> here to sexual abstinence is beset by terrible risks,<lb/> insanity and so forth, has no foundation, at all<lb/> events where we are concerned with reasonably<lb/> sound and healthy people.

<other>WHAT are the legitimate objects of marriage?<lb/> We know that many people seek to marry for<lb/> ends that can scarcely be called legitimate, that<lb/> men may marry to obtain a cheap domestic<lb/> drudge or nurse, and that women may marry to<lb/> be kept when they are tired of keeping them<lb/> selves.<lb/> These objects in marriage may or may<lb/> not be moral, but in any case they are scarcely<lb/> its legitimate ends.<lb/> We are here concerned to<lb/> ascertain those ends of marriage which are legiti<lb/> mate when we take the highest ground as moral<lb/> and civilised men and women living in an ad<lb/> vanced state of society and seeking, if we can,<lb/> to advance that state of society still further.<lb/> The primary end of marriage is to beget and<lb/> bear offspring, and to rear them, until they are<lb/> able to take care of themselves. On that basis<lb/> Man is at one with all the mammals and most<lb/> of the birds. If, indeed, we disregard the orig<lb/> inally less essential part of this end that is to<lb/> say, the care and tending of the young this end<lb/> of marriage is not only the primary but usually<lb/></other>

<other>the sole end of sexual intercourse in the whole<lb/> mammal world. As a natural instinct, its<lb/> achievement involves gratification and well-be<lb/> ing, but this bait of gratification is merely a de<lb/> vice of Nature s and not in itself an end having<lb/> any useful function at the periods when concep<lb/> tion is not possible. This is clearly indicated by<lb/> the fact that among animals the female only ex<lb/> periences sexual desire at the season of impreg<lb/> nation, and that desire ceases as soon as impreg<lb/> nation takes place, though this is only in a few<lb/> species true of the male, obviously because, if his<lb/> sexual desire and aptitude were confined to so<lb/> brief a period, the chances of the female meeting<lb/> the right male at the right moment would be too<lb/> seriously diminished; so that the attentive and<lb/> inquisitive attitude towards the female by the<lb/> male animal which we may often think we see<lb/> still traceable in the human species is not the<lb/> outcome of lust fulness for personal gratification<lb/> (&quot;wantonly to satisfy carnal lusts and appetites<lb/> like brute beasts,&quot; as the Anglican Prayer Book<lb/> incorrectly puts it) but implanted by Nature for<lb/> the benefit of the female and the attainment of<lb/> the primary object of procreation. This primary<lb/> object we may term the animal end of marriage.<lb/> This object remains not only the primary but<lb/> even the sole end of marriage among the lower<lb/> races of mankind generally.

It is found,<lb/> it is true, among some lower races, and it ap<lb/> pears that some tribes possess a word for the joy<lb/> of love in a purely psychic sense.<lb/> But even<lb/> among European races the evolution was late.<lb/> The Greek poets, except the latest, showed little<lb/> recognition of love as an element of marriage.<lb/> Theognis compared marriage with cattle-breed<lb/> ing. The Romans of the Republic took much the<lb/> same view. Greeks and Romans alike regarded<lb/> breeding as the one recognisable object of mar<lb/> riage; any other object was mere wantonness<lb/> and had better, they thought, be carried on out<lb/> side marriage.<lb/> Religion, which preserves so<lb/> many ancient and primitive conceptions of life,<lb/> has consecrated this conception also, and Chris<lb/> tianity<lb/> though, as I will point out later, it has<lb/> tended to enlarge the conception at the outset<lb/> only offered the choice between celibacy on the<lb/> one hand and on the other marriage for the pro<lb/> duction of offspring<lb/> Yet, from an early period in human history, a<lb/> secondary function of sexual intercourse had<lb/> been slowly growing up to become one of the<lb/> great objects of marriage. Among animals, it<lb/> may be said, and even sometimes in man, the sex<lb/> ual impulse, when once aroused, makes but a<lb/> short and swift circuit through the brain to reach<lb/> its consummation.

The primitive<lb/> animal instinct, having the sole end of procre<lb/> ation, becomes on its way tp that end the inspir<lb/> ing stimulus to all those psychic energies which<lb/> in civilisation we count most precious. This<lb/> function is thus, we see, a by-product. But, as<lb/> we know, even in our human factories, the<lb/> by-product is sometimes more valuable than<lb/> the product. That is so as regards the functional<lb/> products of human evolution. The hand was<lb/> produced out of the animal forelimb with the<lb/> primary end of grasping the things we materially<lb/> need, but as a by-product the hand has developed<lb/> the function of making and playing the piano and<lb/> the violin, and that secondary (functional by<lb/> product of the hand we account, even as meas<lb/> ured by the rough test of money, more precious,<lb/> however less materially necessary, than its prim<lb/> ary function.

<other>For the most part the by-product accompanies<lb/> the product, throughout, thus adding a second<lb/> ary, yet peculiarly sacred and specially human,<lb/> object of marriage to its primary animal object.<lb/> This may be termed the spiritual object of mar<lb/> riage.<lb/> By the term, &quot;spiritual&quot; we are not to under<lb/> stand any mysterious and supernatural qualities.<lb/> It is simply a convenient name, in distinction<lb/> from animal, to cover all those higher mental<lb/> and emotional processes which in human evolu<lb/> tion are ever gaining greater power. It is need<lb/> less to enumerate the constituents of this spiritual<lb/> end of sexual intercourse, for everyone is entitled<lb/> to enumerate them differently and in different<lb/> order.<lb/> They include not only all that makes<lb/> love a gracious and beautiful erotic art, but the<lb/> whole element of pleasure in so far as pleasure<lb/> is more than a mere animal gratification. Our<lb/> ancient ascetic traditions often make us blind to<lb/> the meaning of pleasure. We see only its pos<lb/> sibilities of evil and not its mightiness for good.<lb/> We forget that, as Romain Rolland says, &quot;Joy<lb/> is as holy as Pain.&quot; No one has insisted so much<lb/> on the supreme importance of the element of<lb/> pleasure in the spiritual ends of sex as James<lb/> Hinton. Rightly used, he declares, Pleasure is<lb/> &quot;the Child of God,&quot; to be recognised as a &quot;mighty<lb/> storehouse of force,&quot; and he pointed out the sig<lb/> nificant fact that in the course of human progress<lb/></other>

<other>its importance increases rather than diminishes.*<lb/> While it is perfectly true that sexual energy may<lb/> be in large degree arrested, and transformed into<lb/> intellectual and moral forms, yet it is also true<lb/> that pleasure itself, and above all, sexual pleas<lb/> ure, wisely used and not abused, may prove the<lb/> stimulus and liberator of our finest and most<lb/> exalted activities. It is largely this remarkable<lb/> function of sexual pleasure which is decisive in<lb/> settling the argument of those who claim that<lb/> continence is the only alternative to the animal<lb/> end of marriage. That argument ignores the lib<lb/> erating and harmonising influences, giving whole<lb/> some balance and sanity to the whole organism,<lb/> imparted by a sexual union which is the outcome<lb/> of the psychic as well as physical needs. There<lb/> is, further, in the attainment of the spiritual end<lb/> of marriage, much more than the benefit of each<lb/> individual separately.<lb/> There is, that is to say,<lb/> the effect on the union itself. For through har<lb/> monious sex relationships a deeper spiritual unity<lb/> is reached than can possibly be derived from con<lb/> tinence in or out of marriage, and the marriage<lb/> association becomes an apter instrument in the<lb/> service of the world. Apart from any sexual<lb/> craving, the complete spiritual contact of two<lb/> persons who love each other can only be attained<lb/> through some act of rare intimacy. No act can<lb/> be quite so intimate as the sexual embrace. In<lb/></other>

<other>I have mentioned how the Church in part in<lb/> fluenced by that clinging to primitive conceptions<lb/> which always marks religions and in part by its<lb/> ancient traditions of asceticism tended to insist<lb/> mainly, if not exclusively, on the animal object of<lb/> marriage. It sought to reduce sex to a minimum<lb/> because the pagans magnified sex; it banned<lb/> pleasure because the Christian s path on earth<lb/> was the way of the Cross ; and even if theologians<lb/> accepted the idea of a &quot;Sacrament of Nature&quot;<lb/> they could only allow it to operate when the ac<lb/> tive interference of the priest was impossible,,<lb/> though it must in justice be said that, before the<lb/> Council of Trent, the Western Church recognised<lb/> that the sacrament of marriage was effected en<lb/> tirely by the act of the two celebrants themselves<lb/> and not by the priest. Gradually, however, a<lb/> more reasonable and humane opinion crept into<lb/> the Church. Intercourse outside the animal end<lb/> of marriage was indeed a sin, but it became mere<lb/> ly a venial sin. The great influence of St. Augus<lb/> tine was on the side of allowing much freedom<lb/> to intercourse outside the aim of procreation. At<lb/> the Reformation, John a Lasco,, a Catholic<lb/> Bishop who became a Protestant and settled in<lb/> England, laid it down, following various earlier<lb/> theologians, that the object of marriage, besides<lb/> offspring, was to serve as a &quot;sacrament of con<lb/> solation&quot; to the united couple, and that view was<lb/> more or less accepted by the founders of the<lb/></other> 

<page_header>THE OBJECTS OF MARRIAGE<lb/></page_header> 
<page>71<lb/></page> 
<other>Protestant churches. It is the generally accepted<lb/> Protestant view to-day.* The importance of the<lb/> spiritual end of intercourse in marriage, alike<lb/> for the higher development of each member of<lb/> the couple and for the intimacy and stability of<lb/> their union, is still more emphatically set forth<lb/> by the more advanced thinkers of to-day.<lb/> There is something pathetic in the spectacle of<lb/> those among us who are still only able to recog<lb/> nise the animal end of marriage, and who point<lb/> to the example of the lower animals among<lb/> whom the biological conditions are entirely dif<lb/> ferent<lb/> as worthy of our imitation. It has taken<lb/> God or Nature, if we will unknown millions<lb/> of years of painful struggle to evolve Man, and<lb/> to raise the human species above that helpless<lb/> bondage to reproduction which marks the lower<lb/> animals.<lb/> But on these people it has all been<lb/> wasted. They are at the animal stage still. They<lb/> have yet to learn the A. B. C. of love. A repre<lb/> sentative of these people in the person of an<lb/> Anglican bishop, the Bishop of Southwark, ap<lb/> peared as a witness before the National Birth-<lb/> Rate Commission which, a few years ago, met<lb/> in London to investigate the decline of the birth<lb/> rate.<lb/> He declared that procreation is the sole<lb/> legitimate object of marriage and that inter<lb/> course for any other end was a degrading act of<lb/></other>

<other>mere &quot;self -gratification.&quot; This declaration had<lb/> the interesting result of evoking the comments of<lb/> many members of the Commission, formed of rep<lb/> resentative men and women with various stand<lb/> points<lb/> Protestant, Catholic, and other and it<lb/> is notable that while not one identified himself<lb/> with the Bishop s opinion, several decisively op<lb/> posed that opinion, as contrary to the best beliefs<lb/> of both ancient and modern times, as represent<lb/> ing a low and not a high moral standpoint, and<lb/> as involving the notion that the whole sexual<lb/> activity of an individual should be reduced to<lb/> perhaps two or three effective acts of inter<lb/> course in a lifetime. Such a notion obviously<lb/> cannot be carried into general practice, putting<lb/> aside the question as to whether it would be de<lb/> sirable, and it may be added that it would have<lb/> the further result of shutting out from the life<lb/> of love altogether all those persons who, for<lb/> whatever reason, feel that it is their duty to re<lb/> frain from having children at all. It is the atti<lb/> tude of a handful of Pharisees seeking to thrust<lb/> the bulk of mankind into Hell. All this confu<lb/> sion and evil comes of the blindness which cannot<lb/> know that, beyond the primary animal end of<lb/> propagation in marriage, there is a secondary<lb/> but more exalted spiritual end.<lb/> It is needless to insist how intimately that sec<lb/> ondary end of marriage is bound up with the<lb/> practice of birth-control, Without birth-control,<lb/></other>

<other>IT has always been common to discuss the<lb/> psychology of women. The psychology of men<lb/> has usually been passed over, whether because it<lb/> is too simple or too complicated. But the mar<lb/> riage question to-day is much less the wife-prob<lb/> lem than the husband-problem. Women in their<lb/> personal and social activities have been slowly<lb/> expanding along lines which are now generally<lb/> accepted. But there has been no marked change<lb/> of responsive character in the activities of men.<lb/> Hence a defective adjustment of men and women,<lb/> felt in all sorts of subtle as well as grosser ways,<lb/> most felt when they are husband and wife, and<lb/> sometimes becoming acute.<lb/> It is necessary to make clear that, as is here<lb/> assumed at the outset, &quot;man&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are<lb/> not quite the same thing, even when they refer<lb/> to the same person. No doubt that is also true<lb/> of &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;wife.&quot; A woman in her qual<lb/> ity as woman may be a different kind of person<lb/> from what she is in her function as wife. But<lb/> in the case of a man the distinction is more<lb/></other>

<page_header>LITTLE ESSAYS OF LOVE AND VIRTUE<lb/></page_header>
<other>marked. One may know a man well in the world<lb/> as a man and not know him at all in his home<lb/> as a husband; not necessarily that he is unfav<lb/> ourably revealed in the latter capacity. It is sim<lb/> ply that he is different.<lb/> The explanation is not really far to seek. A<lb/> man in the world is in vital response to the influ<lb/> ences around him. But a husband in the home is<lb/> playing a part which was created for him long<lb/> centuries before he was born. He is falling into<lb/> a convention, which, indeed, was moulded to fit<lb/> many masculine human needs but has become<lb/> rigidly traditionalised.<lb/> Thus the part no longer<lb/> corresponds accurately to the player s nature nor<lb/> to the circumstances under which it has to be<lb/> played.<lb/> In the marriage system which has prevailed<lb/> in our world for several thousand years, a cer<lb/> tain hierarchy, or sacred order in authority, has<lb/> throughout been recognised. The family has<lb/> been regarded as a small State of which the hus<lb/> band and father is head. Classic paganism and<lb/> Christianity differed on many points, but they<lb/> were completely at one on this. The Roman sys<lb/> tem was on a patriarchal basis and continued to<lb/> be so theoretically even when in practise it came<lb/> to allow great independence to the wife. Chris<lb/> tianity, although it allowed complete spiritual<lb/> freedom to the individual, introduced no fund<lb/> amentally new theory of the family, and, indeed,<lb/></other>

<page>77<lb/></page> 
<other>re-inforced the old theory by regarding the fam<lb/> ily as a little church of which the husband was<lb/> the head.<lb/> Just as Christ is the head of the<lb/> Church, St. Paul repeatedly asserted, so the hus<lb/> band is the head of the wife; therefore, as it was<lb/> constantly argued during the Middle Ages, a<lb/> man is bound to rule his wife. St. Augustine,<lb/> the most influential of Christian Fathers, even<lb/> said that a wife should be proud to consider her<lb/> self as the servant of her husband, his ancilla, a<lb/> word that had in it the suggestion of slave. That<lb/> was the underlying assumption throughout the<lb/> Middle Ages,, for the Northern Germanic peo<lb/> ples, having always been accustomed to wife-pur<lb/> chase before their conversion, had found it quite<lb/> easy to assimilate the Christian view. Protest<lb/> antism, even Puritanism with its associations of<lb/> spiritual revolt, so far from modifying the ac<lb/> cepted attitude, strengthened it, for they found<lb/> authority for all social organisation in the Bible,<lb/> and the Bible revealed an emphatic predomin<lb/> ance of the Jewish husband, who possessed essen<lb/> tial rights to which the wife had no claim. Mil<lb/> ton, who had the poet s sensitiveness to the<lb/> loveliness of woman, and the lonely man s feel<lb/> ing for the solace of her society, was yet firmly<lb/> assured of the husband s superiority over his<lb/> wife. He has indeed furnished the classical pic<lb/> ture of it in Adam and Eve,<lb/> &quot;He for God only, she for God in him,&quot;<lb/></other>

<page>f78<lb/></page> 
<page_header>LITTLE ESSAYS OF LOVE AND VIRTUE<lb/></page_header> 
<other>and to that God she owed &quot;subjection,&quot; even<lb/> though she might qualify it by &quot;sweet reluctant<lb/> amorous delay.&quot; This was completely in har<lb/> mony with the legal position of the wife. As a<lb/> subject she was naturally in subjection; she<lb/> owed her husband the same loyalty as a subject<lb/> owes the sovereign; her disloyalty to him was<lb/> termed a minor form of treason ; if she murdered<lb/> him the crime was legally worse than murder<lb/> and she rendered herself liable to be burnt.<lb/> We see that all the influences on our civili<lb/> sation, religious and secular,, southern and north<lb/> ern, have combined to mould the underlying bony<lb/> structure of our family system in such a way that,<lb/> however it may appear softened and disguised<lb/> on the surface, the husband is the head and the<lb/> wife subject to him. We must not be supposed<lb/> hereby to deny that the wife has had much au<lb/> thority, many privileges, considerable freedom,<lb/> and in individual cases much opportunity to<lb/> domineer, whatever superiority custom or brute<lb/> strength may have given the husband. There<lb/> are henpecked husbands, it has been remarked,<lb/> even in aboriginal Australia. It is necessary to<lb/> avoid the error of those enthusiasts for the<lb/> emancipation of women who,, out of their eager<lb/> faith in the future of women, used to describe<lb/> her past as one of scarcely mitigated servitude<lb/> and hardship. If women had not constantly suc<lb/> ceeded in overcoming or eluding the difficulties<lb/></other>

<page_header>HUSBANDS AND WIVES<lb/></page_header> 
<page>79<lb/></page> 
<other>that beset them in the past, it would be foolish<lb/> to cherish any faith in their future. It must,<lb/> moreover, be remembered that the very constitu<lb/> tion of that ecclesiastico-feudal hierarchy which<lb/> made the husband supreme over the wife, also<lb/> made the wife jointly with her husband supreme<lb/> over their children and over their servants. The<lb/> Middle Ages, alike in England and in France, as<lb/> doubtless in Christendom generally, accepted the<lb/> rule laid down in Gfatian s Decretum, the great<lb/> mediaeval text-book of Canon Law, that &quot;the<lb/> husband may chastise his wife temperately, for<lb/> she is of his household,&quot; but the wife might chas<lb/> tise her daughters and her servants, and she<lb/> sometimes exercised that right in ways that we<lb/> should nowadays think scarcely temperate.<lb/> If we seek to observe how the system worked<lb/> some five hundred years ago when it had not yet<lb/> become, as it is to-day, both weakened and dis<lb/> guised, we cannot do better than turn to the<lb/> Paston Letters, the most instructive documents<lb/> we possess concerning the domestic life of ex<lb/> cellent yet fairly average people of the upper<lb/> middle class in England in the fifteenth century.<lb/> Marriage was still frankly and fundamentally<lb/> (as it was in the following century and less<lb/> frankly later) a commercial transaction. The<lb/> wooer, when he had a wife in view, stated as a<lb/> matter of course that he proposed to &quot;deal&quot; in<lb/> the matter ; it was quite recognised on both sides<lb/></other>

<other>that love and courtship must depend on whether<lb/> the &quot;deal&quot; came off satisfactorily. John Paston<lb/> approached Sir Thomas Brews, through a third<lb/> person, with a view to negotiate a marriage with<lb/> his daughter Margery. She was willing, even<lb/> eager, and while the matter was still uncertain<lb/> she wrote him a letter on Valentine s Day, ad<lb/> dressing him as &quot;Right reverent and worshipful<lb/> and my right well-beloved Valentine,&quot; to tell him<lb/> that it was impossible for her father to offer a<lb/> larger dowry than he had already promised. &quot;If<lb/> that you could be content with that good, and my<lb/> poor person, I would be the merriest maiden on<lb/> ground.&quot;<lb/> In his first letter boldly written,, he<lb/> says, without her knowledge or license he ad<lb/> dresses her simply as &quot;Mistress,&quot; and assures her<lb/> that &quot;I am and will be yours and at your com<lb/> mandment in every wise during my life.&quot; A few<lb/> weeks later, addressing him as &quot;Right worship<lb/> ful master,&quot; she calls him &quot;mine own sweet<lb/> heart,&quot;<lb/> and ends up, as she frequently does,<lb/> &quot;your servant and bedeswoman.&quot; Some months<lb/> later, a few weeks after marriage, she addresses<lb/> her husband in the correct manner of the time<lb/> as &quot;Right reverent and worshipful husband,&quot;<lb/> asking him to buy her a gown as she is weary of<lb/> wearing her present one, it is so cumbrous. Five<lb/> years later she refers to &quot;all&quot; the babies, and<lb/> writes in haste: &quot;Right reverent and worshipful<lb/> Sir, in my most humble wise I recommend me<lb/></other>

Once only, with<lb/> unexampled effusion, he writes to her as &quot;My<lb/> own dear sovereign lady&quot; and signs himself<lb/> &quot;Your true and trusting husband.&quot;*<lb/> If we turn to France the relation of the wife<lb/> to her husband was the same, or even more defin<lb/> itely dependent, for he occupied the place of fa<lb/> ther to her as well as of husband and sovereign,<lb/> in this respect carrying on a tradition of Roman<lb/> Law.

This<lb/> book was, as we know, written for the instruction<lb/> of his daughters by a Knight who seems to have<lb/> been a fairly average man of his time in his be<lb/> liefs, and in character, as he has been described,<lb/> probably above it, &quot;a man of the world, a Chris<lb/> tian, a parent, and a gentleman.&quot; His book is<lb/> full of interesting light on the customs and man<lb/> ners of his day, though it is mainly a picture of<lb/> what the writer thought ought to be rather than<lb/> what always was. Herein the Knight is saga<lb/> cious and moderate, much of his advice is ad<lb/> mirably sound for every age. He is less con<lb/> cerned with affirming the authority of husbands<lb/> than with assuring the happiness and well-being<lb/> of his dearly loved daughters. But he clearly<lb/> finds this bound up with the recognition of the<lb/> authority of the husband, and the demands he<lb/> makes are fairly concordant with the relation<lb/> ships we see established among the Pastons.

<other>local rituals this point was further driven home,<lb/> and on the delivery of the ring the bride knelt<lb/> and kissed the bridegroom s right foot. In course<lb/> of time this was modified, at all events in France,<lb/> and she simply dropped the ring, so that her<lb/> motion of stooping was regarded as for the pur<lb/> pose of picking it up. I note that change for it is<lb/> significant of the ways in which we modify the<lb/> traditions of the past, not quite abandoning them<lb/> but pretending that they have other than the<lb/> fundamental original motives. We see just the<lb/> same thing in the use of the ring, which was in<lb/> the first place a part of the bride-price, frequently<lb/> accompanied by money, proof that the wife had<lb/> been duly purchased. It was thus made easy to<lb/> regard the ring as really a golden fetter. That<lb/> idea soon became offensive,, and the new idea was<lb/> originated that the ring was a pledge of affection ;<lb/> thus, quite early in some countries, the husband<lb/> also wore a wedding ring.<lb/> The marriage order illustrated by the Paston<lb/> Letters and the Book of the Chevalier de la Tour-<lb/> Landry before the Reformation, and the Angli<lb/> can Book of Common Prayer afterwards, has<lb/> never been definitely broken; it is a part of our<lb/> living tradition to-day.

<other>the Code Napoleon and still less anywhere else.<lb/> Interwoven with all the new developments, and<lb/> however less obtrusive it may have become, the<lb/> old tradition still continues among us. Since,<lb/> also, the husband is, conventionally and in large<lb/> measure really, the economic support of the<lb/> home, the work of the wife and even actual<lb/> financial contributions brought by her not being<lb/> supposed to affect that convention, this state<lb/> of things is held to be justified.<lb/> Thus when a man enters the home as a hus<lb/> band, to seat himself on the antique domestic<lb/> throne and to play the part assigned to him of<lb/> old, he is involuntarily, even unconsciously, fol<lb/> lowing an ancient tradition and taking his place<lb/> in a procession of husbands which began long<lb/> ages before he was born. It thus comes about<lb/> that a man, even after he is married, and a hus<lb/> band are two different persons, so that his wife<lb/> who mainly knows him as a husband may be un<lb/> able to form any just idea of what he is like as<lb/> a man. As a husband he has stepped out of the<lb/> path that belongs to him in the world, and taken<lb/> on another part which has called out altogether<lb/> different reactions, so he is sometimes a much<lb/> more admirable person in one of these spheres<lb/> whichever it may be than in the other.<lb/> We must not be surprised if the husband s posi<lb/> tion has sometimes developed those qualities<lb/> which from the modern point of view are the less<lb/></other>

<other>admirable.<lb/> In this respect the sovereign hus<lb/> band resembles the Sovereign State. The Sov<lb/> ereign State, as it has survived from Renais<lb/> sance days in our modern world, may be made<lb/> up of admirable people, yet as a State they are<lb/> forced into an attitude of helpless egoism which<lb/> nowadays fails to commend itself to the outside<lb/> world, and the tendency of scientific jurists to<lb/> day is to deal very critically with the old con<lb/> ception of the Sovereign State. It is so with<lb/> the husband in the home. He was thrust by<lb/> ancient tradition into a position of sovereignty<lb/> which impelled him to play a part of helpless<lb/> egoism.<lb/> He was a celestial body in the home<lb/> around which all the other inmates were revolv<lb/> ing satellites. The hours of rising and retiring,<lb/> the times of meals and their nature and substance,<lb/> all the activities of the household in which he<lb/> himself takes little or no part are still arranged<lb/> primarily to suit his work, his play, and his<lb/> tastes. This is an accepted matter of course, and<lb/> not the result of any violent self-assertion on his<lb/> part.<lb/> It is equally an accepted matter of course<lb/> that the wife should be constantly occupied in<lb/> keeping this little solar system in easy harmoni<lb/> ous movement, evolving from it, if she has the<lb/> skill, the music of the spheres. She has no rec<lb/> ognised independent personality of her own, nor<lb/> even any right to go away by herself for a little<lb/> change and recreation. Any work of her own,<lb/></other>

<other>play of her own, tastes of her own, must be<lb/> strictly subordinated, if not suppressed alto<lb/> gether.<lb/> In the old days, from which our domestic tra<lb/> ditions proceed, little hardship was thus inflicted<lb/> on the wife. Her rights and privileges were, in<lb/> deed, far less than those of the modern woman,<lb/> but for that very reason the home offered her a<lb/> larger field; beneath the shelter of her husband<lb/> the irresponsible wife might exert a maximum of<lb/> influential activity with a minimum of rights<lb/> and privileges of her own. To many men, even<lb/> to-day, that state of things seems the realisation<lb/> of an ideal.<lb/> Yet to women it seems increasingly less so,<lb/> and of necessity since the cleavage between the<lb/> position of woman in society and law, and the<lb/> position of the wife in the sacramental bonds of<lb/> wedlock, is daily becoming greater. To-day a<lb/> woman, who possibly for ten years has been lead<lb/> ing her own life of independent w r ork, earning<lb/> her own living, choosing her own conditions in<lb/> accordance with her own needs, and selecting her<lb/> own periods of recreation in accordance with her<lb/> own tastes, whether or not this may have in<lb/> cluded the society of a man- friend such a<lb/> woman suddenly finds on marriage, and with<lb/> out any assertion of authority on her husband s<lb/> part, that all the outward circumstances of her<lb/> life are reversed and all her inner spontaneous<lb/></other>

She loves her<lb/> husband too much to wish to hurt his feelings by<lb/> explaining the situation, and she values domestic<lb/> peace too much to risk friction by making unex<lb/> pected claims. But beneath the surface there is<lb/> often a profound discontent, and even in women<lb/> who thought they had gained an insight into life,<lb/> a sense of disillusion. Everyone knows this who<lb/> is privileged to catch a glimpse into the hearts<lb/> of women often women of most distinguished<lb/> intelligence as well as women of quite ordinary<lb/> nature who leave a life of spontaneous activity<lb/> in the world to enter the home.*<lb/> It is not to be supposed that in this presenta<lb/> tion of the situation in the home, as it is to-day<lb/> visible to those who are privileged to see beneath<lb/> the surface, any accusation is brought against<lb/></other> 
<page_footnote>* While this condition of things is sometimes to be found in<lb/> the more distinguished minority and in well-to-do families, it<lb/> is,<lb/> of course, among the great labouring majority that it is<lb/> most conspicuous. Mrs. Will Crooks, of Poplar, speaking to a<lb/> newspaper reporter (Daily Chronicle, 17 Feb., 1919), truly re<lb/> marked : &quot;At present the average married woman s working day<lb/> is a flagrant contradiction of all trade-union ideals. The poor<lb/> thing is slaving all the time ! What she needs what she longs<lb/> for is just a little break or change now and again, an oppor<lb/> tunity to get her mind off her work and its worries. If her<lb/> husband s hours are reduced to eight, well that gives her a<lb/> chance, doesn t it? The home and the children are, after all,<lb/> as much his as hers. With his enlarged leisure he will now be<lb/> able to take a fair share in home duties. I suggest that they take<lb/> it turn and turn about one night he goes out and she looks<lb/> after the house and the children; the next night she goes out<lb/> and he takes charge of things at home. She can sometimes go<lb/> to the cinema, sometimes call on friends. Then, say once a<lb/> week, they can both go out together, taking the children with<lb/> them. That will be a little change and treat for everybody.&quot;<lb/></page_footnote>

The point is that the<lb/> events of the past hundred years have produced a<lb/> discrepancy in the two lines of tradition, with a<lb/> resultant lack of harmony, independent of the<lb/> goodwill of either husband or wife.<lb/> Olive Schreiner, in her Woman and Labour,<lb/> has eloquently set forth the tendency to parasit<lb/> ism which civilisation produces in women; they<lb/> no longer exercise the arts and industries which<lb/> were theirs in former ages, and so they become<lb/> economically dependent on men, losing their en<lb/> ergies and aptitudes, and becoming like those dull<lb/> parasitic animals which live as blood-suckers of<lb/> their host.<lb/> That picture, which was of course<lb/> never true of all women, is now ceasing to be<lb/> true of any but a negligible minority ; it presents,<lb/> moreover, a parasitism limited to the economic<lb/> side of life. For if the wife has often been a<lb/> lazy gold-sucking parasite on her husband in the<lb/> world, the husband has yet oftener been a help<lb/> less service-absorbing parasite on his wife in the<lb/> home. There is, that is to say, not only an eco<lb/> nomic parasitism, with no adequate return for<lb/> financial support, but a still more prevalent do<lb/> mestic parasitism, with an absorption of services<lb/> for which no return would be adequate.

The<lb/> average husband enjoys the total effect of his<lb/> home but is usually unable to contribute any of<lb/> the details of work and organisation that make<lb/> it enjoyable.<lb/> He cannot keep it in order and<lb/> cleanliness and regulated movement, he seldom<lb/> knows how to buy the things that are needed for<lb/> its upkeep, nor how to prepare and cook and<lb/> present a decent meal; he cannot even attend to<lb/> his own domestic needs. It is the wife s consola<lb/> tion that most husbands are not always at home.<lb/> &quot;In<lb/> ministering to the wants of the family,<lb/> the woman has reduced man to a state of con<lb/> siderable dependency on her in all domestic af<lb/> fairs, just as she is dependent on him for bodily<lb/> protection.<lb/> In the course of ages this has gone<lb/> so far as to foster a peculiar helplessness on the<lb/> part of the man, which manifests itself in a some<lb/> what childlike reliance of the husband on the<lb/> wife. In fact it may be said that the husband is,<lb/> to all intents and purposes, incapable of main<lb/> taining himself without the aid of a woman.&quot;<lb/> This passage will probably seem to many readers<lb/> to apply quite fairly well to men as they exist to<lb/> day in most of those lands -which we consider at<lb/> the summit of our civilisation.

His wife soon<lb/> realises that it is a choice between his return to<lb/> the home and complete separation. Most wives<lb/> never get even as far as this attempt at solution<lb/> of the difficulty and hide their secret discontent.<lb/> This is the situation which to-day is becoming<lb/> intensified and extended on .a vast scale. The<lb/> habit and the taste for freedom, adventure, and<lb/> economic independence is becoming generated<lb/> among millions of women who once meekly trod<lb/> the ancient beaten paths, and we must not be so<lb/> foolish as to suppose that they can suddenly re<lb/> nounce those habits and tastes at the threshold of<lb/> marriage. Moreover, it is becoming clear to men<lb/> and to women alike, and for the first time, that<lb/> the world can be remoulded, and that the claims<lb/> for better conditions of work, for a higher stand<lb/> ard of life, and for the attainment of leisure,<lb/> which previously had only feebly been put for<lb/> ward, may now be asserted drastically. We see<lb/> therefore to-day a great revolutionary movement,<lb/> mainly on the part of men in the world of Labour,<lb/> and we see a corresponding movement, however<lb/> less ostentatious, mainly on the part of women,,<lb/> in the world of the Home.<lb/> It may seem to some that this new movement<lb/> of upheaval in the sphere of the Home is merely<lb/></other>

Just as we realise that the movement now<lb/> in progress in the world of Labour for a higher<lb/> standard of life and for, as it has been termed,<lb/> a larger &quot;leisure-ration,&quot; represents a wholesome<lb/> revolt against the crushing conditions of pro<lb/> longed monotonous work the most deadening<lb/> of all work and a real advance towards those<lb/> ideals of democracy which are still so remote, so<lb/> it is with the movement in the Home. That also<lb/> is the claim for a new and fairer allotment of<lb/> responsibility, of larger opportunities for free<lb/> dom and leisure. If in the home the husband is<lb/> still to be regarded as the capitalist and the wife<lb/> as the labourer, then at all events it has to be<lb/> recognised that he owes her not only the satis<lb/> faction of her physical needs of food and shelter<lb/> and clothing, but the opportunity to satisfy the<lb/> personal spontaneous claims of her own indi<lb/> vidual nature.<lb/> Just as the readjustment of<lb/> Labour is really only an approach to the long<lb/> recognised ideals of Democracy, so the read<lb/> justment of the Home, far from being subversive<lb/> or revolutionary, is merely an approximation to<lb/> the long recognised ideals of marriage.<lb/> How in practice, one may finally ask, is this<lb/> readjustment of the home likely to be carried<lb/> out?<lb/> In the first place we are justified in believing<lb/></other>

<other>that in the future home men will no longer be so<lb/> helpless, so domestically parasitic, as in the past.<lb/> This change is indeed already coming about. It<lb/> is an inestimable benefit throughout life for a<lb/> man to have been forcibly lifted out of the rou<lb/> tine comforts and feminine services of the old-<lb/> fashioned home and to be thrown into an alien<lb/> and solitary environment, face to face with<lb/> Nature and the essential domestic human needs<lb/> (in my own case I owe an inestimable debt to the<lb/> chance that thus flung me into the Australian<lb/> bush in early life), and one may note that the<lb/> Great War has had, directly and indirectly, a re<lb/> markable influence in this direction, for it not<lb/> only compelled women to exercise many enlarg<lb/> ing and fortifying functions commonly counted<lb/> as pertaining to men, it also compelled men,<lb/> deprived of accustomed feminine services, to de<lb/> velop a new independent ability for organising<lb/> domesticity, and that ability, even though it is<lb/> not permanently exercised in rendering domestic<lb/> services, must yet always make clear the nature<lb/> of domestic problems and tend to prevent the<lb/> demand for unnecessary domestic services.<lb/> But there is another quite different and more<lb/> general line along which we may expect this<lb/> problem to be largely solved.

We cannot regu<lb/> late even the material side of life without culti<lb/> vating that intelligence in the development of<lb/> which civilisation so largely consists.<lb/> Intelligence, and even something more than<lb/> intelligence, is needed along the third line of<lb/> progress towards the modernised home. Simpli<lb/> fication and organisation can effect nothing in<lb/> the desired transformation if they merely end<lb/> in themselves. They are only helpful in so far<lb/> as they economise energy, offer a more ample<lb/> leisure, and extend the opportunities for that<lb/> play of the intellect, that liberation of the emo<lb/> tions with accompanying discipline of the primi<lb/> tive instincts, which are needed not only for the<lb/></other>

We have seen, as we look back,<lb/> the futility in the end of the ancient structure of<lb/> the home, however reasonable it was at the be<lb/> ginning, under our different modern social con<lb/> ditions, and for women to attempt nowadays to<lb/> reintroduce the same structure, merely reversed,<lb/> would be not only mischievous but silly. That<lb/> spirit of narrow exclusiveness and self centred<lb/> egoism even if it were sometimes an egoism*<lb/> a deux evoked, half a century ago, the scathing<lb/> sarcasm of James Hinton, who never wearied<lb/> of denouncing the Virtuous and happy homes&quot;<lb/> which he saw as &quot;floating blotches of verdure on<lb/> a sea of filth.&quot; Such outbursts seem extrava<lb/> gant, but they were the extravagance of an ideal<lb/> ist at the vision which, as a physician in touch<lb/> with realities, he had seen beneath the surface of<lb/> the home.<lb/> It is well to insist on the organisation of the<lb/> mechanical and material side of life. Some lead<lb/> ers of women movements feel this so strongly<lb/> that they insist on nothing else.

We may smile, therefore, when it<lb/> is remarked that the future developments of the<lb/> home are risky.

If the home is an experiment<lb/> and a risky experiment, one can only say that life<lb/> is always like that. We have to see to it that in<lb/> this central experiment, on which our happiness<lb/> so largely depends, all our finest qualities are<lb/> mobilised.<lb/> Even the smallest homes under the<lb/> new conditions cannot be built to last with small<lb/> minds and small hearts. Indeed the discipline<lb/> of the home demands not only the best intellectual<lb/> qualities that are available, but often involves<lb/> and in men as well as in women a spiritual<lb/> training fit to make sweeter and more generous<lb/> saints than any cloister.

<other>WHAT is the part of woman, one is sometimes<lb/> asked, in the sex act? Must it be the wife s con<lb/> cern in the marital embrace to sacrifice her own<lb/> wishes from a sense of love and duty towards<lb/> her husband? Or is the wife entitled to an equal<lb/> mutual interest and joy in this act with her hus<lb/> band? It seems a simple problem. In so funda<lb/> mental a relationship, which goes back to the<lb/> beginning of sex in the dawn of life, it might<lb/> appear that we could leave Nature to decide.<lb/> Yet it is not so. Throughout the history of<lb/> civilisation, wherever we can trace the feelings<lb/> and ideas which have prevailed on this matter<lb/> and the resultant conduct, the problem has ex<lb/> isted, often to produce discord, conflict, and<lb/> misery. The problem still exists to-day and with<lb/> as important results as in the past.<lb/> In Nature, before the arrival of Man, it can<lb/> scarcely be said indeed that any difficulty existed.<lb/> It was taken for granted at that time that the<lb/> female had both the right to her own body, and<lb/> the right to a certain amount of enjoyment in<lb/></other>

It often cost the male a serious<lb/> amount of trouble though he never failed to<lb/> find it worth while to explain to her the point<lb/> where he may be allowed to come in, and to per<lb/> suade her that he can contribute to her enjoy<lb/> ment.<lb/> So it generally is throughout Nature,<lb/> before we reach Man, and, though it is not in<lb/> variably obvious, we often find it even among<lb/> the unlikeliest animals. As is well known, it is<lb/> most pronounced among the birds, who have in<lb/> some species carried the erotic art, and the<lb/> faithful devotion which properly accompanied<lb/> the erotic art as being an essential part of it,<lb/> to the highest point. We have here the great<lb/> natural fact of courtship. Throughout Nature,<lb/> wherever we meet with animals of a high type,<lb/> often indeed when they are of a lowly type -<lb/> provided they have not been rendered unnatural<lb/> by domestication every act of sexual union is<lb/> preceded by a process of courtship. There is a<lb/> sound physiological reason for this courtship,<lb/> for in the act of wooing and being wooed the<lb/> psychic excitement gradually generated in the<lb/> brains of the two partners acts as a stimulant<lb/> to arouse into full activity the mechanism which<lb/> ensures sexual union and aids ultimate impregna<lb/> tion.<lb/> Such courtship is thus a fundamental<lb/> natural fact.<lb/> It is as a natural fact that we still find it in<lb/> full development among a large number of peo-<lb/></other>

New<lb/> conditions, it is true, soon enter to complicate<lb/> the picture presented by savage courtship. The<lb/> economic element of bargaining, destined to<lb/> prove so important, comes in at an early stage.<lb/> And among peoples leading a violent life, and<lb/> constantly fighting, it has sometimes happened,<lb/> though not always, that courtship also has been<lb/> violent.<lb/> This is not so frequent as was once<lb/> supposed. With better knowledge it was found<lb/> that the seeming brutality once thought to take<lb/> the place of courtship among various peoples in<lb/> a low state of culture was really itself courtship,<lb/> a rough kind of play agreeable to both parties<lb/> and not depriving the feminine partner of her<lb/> own freedom of choice. This was notably the<lb/> case as regards so-called &quot;marriage by capture.&quot;<lb/> While this is sometimes a real capture, it is more<lb/> often a mock capture; the lover perhaps pursues<lb/> the beloved on horseback, but she is as fleet and<lb/> as skilful as he is, cannot be captured unless<lb/> she wishes to be captured, and in addition, as<lb/> among the Kirghiz, she may be armed with a<lb/> formidable whip ; so that &quot;marriage by capture,&quot;<lb/> far from being a hardship imposed on women is<lb/> largely a concession to their modesty and a grati<lb/> fication of their erotic impulses.

<other>excluded, for the exhibition of force by a lover,<lb/> and this is true for civilised as well as for<lb/> savage women, is itself a source of pleasurable<lb/> stimulation, and when that is so the essence of<lb/> courtship may be attained even more successfully<lb/> by the forceful than by the humble lover.<lb/> The evolution of society, however, tended to<lb/> overlay and sometimes even to suppress those<lb/> fundamental natural tendencies. The position of<lb/> the man as the sole and uncontested head of the<lb/> family, the insistence on paternity and male<lb/> descent, the accompanying economic develop<lb/> ments, and the tendency to view a woman less as<lb/> a self-disposing individual than as an object of<lb/> barter belonging to her father, the consequent<lb/> rigidity of the marriage bond and the stern in<lb/> sistence on wifely fidelity all these conditions<lb/> of developing civilisation, while still leaving<lb/> courtship possible, diminished its significance and<lb/> even abolished its necessity. Moreover, on the<lb/> basis of the social, economic, and legal develop<lb/> ments thus established, new moral, spiritual, and<lb/> religious forces were slowly generated, which<lb/> worked on these rules of merely exterior order,<lb/> and interiorised them, thus giving them power<lb/> over the souls as well as over the bodies of<lb/> women.<lb/> The result was that, directly and indirectly,<lb/> the legal, economic, and erotic rights of women<lb/></other>

<other>were all diminished. It is with the erotic rights<lb/> only that we are here concerned.<lb/> No doubt in its erotic aspects, as well as in<lb/> its legal and economic aspects, the social order<lb/> thus established was described, and in good faith,<lb/> as beneficial to women, and even as maintained<lb/> in their interests.<lb/> Monogamy and the home, it<lb/> was claimed, alike existed for the benefit and<lb/> protection of women. It was not so often ex<lb/> plained that they greatly benefited and protected<lb/> men, with, moreover, this additional advantage<lb/> that while women were absolutely confined to<lb/> the home, men were free to exercise their activi<lb/> ties outside the home, even, with tacit general<lb/> consent, on the erotic side.<lb/> Whatever the real benefits, and there is no<lb/> occasion for questioning them, of the sexual<lb/> order thus established, it becomes clear that in<lb/> certain important respects it had an unnatural<lb/> and repressive influence on the erotic aspect of<lb/> woman s sexual life. It fostered the reproductive<lb/> side of woman s sexual life, but it rendered<lb/> difficult for her the satisfaction of the instinct<lb/> for that courtship which is the natural prelimi<lb/> nary of reproductive activity, an instinct even<lb/> more highly developed in the female than in the<lb/> male, and the more insistent because in the order<lb/> of Nature the burden of maternity is preceded<lb/> by the reward of pleasure. But the marriage<lb/> order which had become established led to the<lb/></other> 

<page_header>THE LOVE-RIGHTS OF WOMEN</page_header> 
<page>107<lb/></page> 
<other>indirect result of banning pleasure in women, or<lb/> at all events in wives. It was regarded as too<lb/> dangerous, and even as degrading. The women<lb/> who wanted pleasure were not considered fit for<lb/> the home, but more suited to be devoted to an<lb/> exclusive &quot;life of pleasure,&quot; which soon turned<lb/> out to be not their own pleasure but men s. A<lb/> &quot;life of pleasure,&quot; in that sense or in any other<lb/> sense, was not what more than a small minority<lb/> of women ever desired. The desire of women<lb/> for courtship is not a thing by itself, and was<lb/> not implanted for gratification by itself. It is<lb/> naturally intertwined and to a much greater<lb/> degree than the corresponding desire in men<lb/> with her deepest personal, family, and social in<lb/> stincts, so that if these are desecrated and lost its<lb/> charm soon fades.<lb/> The practices and the ideals of this established<lb/> morality were both due to men, and both were so<lb/> thoroughly fashioned that they subjugated alike<lb/> the actions and the feelings of women. There is<lb/> no sphere which we regard as so peculiarly<lb/> women s sphere as that of love. Yet there is no<lb/> sphere which in civilisation women have so far<lb/> had so small a part in regulating. Their deepest<lb/> impulses their modesty, their maternity, their<lb/> devotion, their emotional receptivity were used,<lb/> with no conscious and deliberate Machiavellism,,<lb/> against themselves, to mould a moral world for<lb/> their habitation which they would not themselves<lb/></other>

<other>have moulded. It is not of modern creation, nor<lb/> by any means due, as some have supposed, to the<lb/> asceticism of Christianity, however much Chris<lb/> tianity may have reinforced it. Indeed one may<lb/> say that in course of time Christianity had an<lb/> influence in weakening it, for Christianity dis<lb/> covered a new reservoir of tender emotion, and<lb/> such emotion may be transferred, and, as a mat<lb/> ter of fact, was transferred, from its first re<lb/> ligious channel into erotic channels which were<lb/> thereby deepened and extended, and without<lb/> reference to any design of Christianity. For the<lb/> ends we achieve are often by no means those<lb/> which we set out to accomplish. In ancient<lb/> classic days this moral order was even more<lb/> severely established than in the Middle Ages.<lb/> Montaigne, in the sixteenth century, declared<lb/> that &quot;marriage is a devout and religious relation<lb/> ship, the pleasures derived from it should be<lb/> restrained and serious, mixed with some sever<lb/> ity.&quot;<lb/> But in this matter he was not merely<lb/> expressing the Christian standpoint but even<lb/> more that of paganism, and he thoroughly agreed<lb/> with the old Greek moralist that a man should<lb/> approach his wife &quot;prudently and severely&quot; for<lb/> fear of inciting her to lasciviousness ; he thought<lb/> that marriage was best arranged by a third party,<lb/> and was inclined to think, with the ancients, that<lb/> women are not fitted to make friends of.<lb/> Montaigne has elsewhere spoken with insight of<lb/></other>

<other>women s instinctive knowledge of the art and<lb/> discipline of love and has pointed out how men<lb/> have imposed their own ideals and rules of action<lb/> on women from whom they have demanded op<lb/> posite and contradictory virtues; yet, we see, he<lb/> approves of this state of things and never sug<lb/> gests that women have any right to opinions of<lb/> their own or feelings of their own when the<lb/> sacred institution of marriage is in question.<lb/> Montaigne represents the more exalted aspects<lb/> of the Pagan-Christian conception of morality<lb/> in marriage which still largely prevails. But that<lb/> conception lent itself to deductions, frankly ac<lb/> cepted even by Montaigne himself, which were<lb/> by no means exalted. &quot;I find,&quot; said Montaigne,,<lb/> &quot;that Venus, after all, is nothing more than the<lb/> pleasure of discharging our vessels, just as<lb/> nature renders pleasurable the discharges from<lb/> other parts.&quot;<lb/> Sir Thomas More among Cath<lb/> olics, and Luther among Protestants, said exactly<lb/> the same thing in other and even clearer words,<lb/> while untold millions of husbands in Christen<lb/> dom down to to-day, whether or not they have<lb/> had the wit to put their theory into a phrase,<lb/> have regularly put it into practice, at all events<lb/> within the consecrated pale of marriage, and<lb/> treated their wives, &quot;severely and prudently,&quot; as<lb/> convenient utensils for the reception of a natural<lb/> excretion.<lb/> Obviously, in this view of marriage, sexual<lb/></other>

<other>activity was regarded as an exclusively masculine<lb/> function, in the exercise of which women had<lb/> merely a passive part to play. Any active par<lb/> ticipation on her side thus seemed unnecessary,<lb/> and even unbefitting, finally, though only in com<lb/> paratively modern times, disgusting and actually<lb/> degrading. Thus Acton, who was regarded half<lb/> a century ago as the chief English authority on<lb/> sexual matters, declared that, &quot;happily for so<lb/> ciety,&quot;<lb/> the supposition that women possess sexual<lb/> feelings could be put aside as &quot;a vile aspersion,&quot;<lb/> while another medical authority of the same<lb/> period stated in regard to the most simple physical<lb/> sign of healthy sexual emotion that it &quot;only hap<lb/> pens in lascivious women.&quot; This final triumph<lb/> of the masculine ideals and rule of life was,<lb/> however, only achieved slowly. It was the cul<lb/> mination of an elaborate process of training. At<lb/> the outset men had found it impossible to speak<lb/> too strongly of the &quot;wantonness&quot; of women.<lb/> This attitude was pronounced among the ancient<lb/> Greeks and prominent in their dramatists.<lb/> Christianity again, which ended by making<lb/> women into the chief pillars of the Church, be<lb/> gan by regarding them as the &quot;Gate of Hell.&quot;<lb/> Again, later, when in the Middle Ages this<lb/> masculine moral order approached the task of<lb/> subjugating the barbarians of Northern Europe,<lb/> men were horrified at the licentiousness of those<lb/></other>

<other>northern women at whose coldness they are now<lb/> shocked.<lb/> That, indeed, was, as Montaigne had seen, the<lb/> central core of conflict in the rule of life imposed<lb/> by men on woman. Men were perpetually<lb/> striving, by ways the most methodical, the most<lb/> subtle, the most far-reaching, to achieve a result<lb/> in women, which, when achieved, men themselves<lb/> viewed with dismay. They may be said to be<lb/> moved in this sphere by two passions, the passion<lb/> for virtue and the passion for vice. But it so<lb/> happens that both these streams of passion have<lb/> to be directed at the same fascinating object:<lb/> Woman. No doubt nothing is more admirable<lb/> than the skill with which women have acquired<lb/> the duplicity necessary to play the two contra<lb/> dictory parts thus imposed upon them. But in<lb/> that requirement the play of their natural re<lb/> actions tended to become paralysed, and the<lb/> delicate mechanism of their instincts often dis<lb/> turbed. They were forbidden, except in a few<lb/> carefully etiquetted forms, the free play of<lb/> courtship, without which they could not perform<lb/> their part in the erotic life with full satisfaction<lb/> either to themselves or their partners.<lb/> They<lb/> were reduced to an artificial simulation of cold<lb/> ness or of warmth, according to the particular<lb/> stage of the dominating masculine ideal of wo<lb/> man which their partner chanced to have reached.<lb/> But that is an attitude equally unsatisfactory to<lb/></other>

<other>themselves and to their lovers, even when the lat<lb/> ter have not sufficient insight to see through its<lb/> unreality.<lb/> It is an attitude so unnatural and<lb/> artificial that it inevitably tends to produce a real<lb/> coldness which nothing can disguise. It is true<lb/> that women whose instincts are not perverted at<lb/> the roots do not desire to be cold. Far from it.<lb/> But to dispel that coldness the right atmosphere<lb/> is needed, and the insight and skill of the right<lb/> man. In the erotic sphere a woman asks nothing<lb/> better of a man than to be lifted above her cold<lb/> ness, to the higher plane where there is reciprocal<lb/> interest and mutual joy in the act of love.<lb/> Therein her silent demand is one with Nature s.<lb/> For the biological order of the world involves<lb/> those claims which, in the human range, are the<lb/> erotic rights of women.<lb/> The social claims of women, their economic<lb/> claims, their political claims, have long been be<lb/> fore the world. Women themselves have actively<lb/> asserted them, and they are all in process of<lb/> realisation.<lb/> The erotic claims of women, which<lb/> are at least as fundamental, are not publicly<lb/> voiced, and women themselves would be the last<lb/> to assert them. It is easy to understand why that<lb/> should be so. The natural and acquired qualities<lb/> of women, even the qualities developed in the art<lb/> of courtship, have all been utilised in building up<lb/> the masculine ideal of sexual morality; it is on<lb/> feminine characteristics that this masculine ideal<lb/></other> 

<page_header>THE LOVE-RIGHTS OF WOMEN<lb/></page_header> 
<page>118<lb/></page> 
<other>has been based, so that women have been helpless<lb/> to protest against it.<lb/> Moreover, even if that<lb/> were not so, to formulate such rights is to raise<lb/> the question whether there so much as exists<lb/> anything that can be called &quot;erotic rights.&quot; The<lb/> right to joy cannot be claimed in the same way<lb/> as one claims the right to put a voting paper in<lb/> a ballot box. A human being s erotic aptitudes<lb/> can only be developed where the right atmosphere<lb/> for them exists, and where the attitudes of both<lb/> persons concerned are in harmonious sympathy.<lb/> That is why the erotic rights of women have been<lb/> the last of all to be attained.<lb/> Yet to-day we see a change here. The change<lb/> required is, it has been said, a change of attitude<lb/> and a resultant change in the atmosphere in<lb/> which the sexual impulses are manifested. It<lb/> involves no necessary change in the external<lb/> order of our marriage system, for, as has already<lb/> been pointed out, it was a coincident and not<lb/> designed part of that order. Various recent lines<lb/> of tendency have converged to produce this<lb/> change of attitude and of atmosphere. In part<lb/> the men of to-day are far more ready than the<lb/> men of former days to look upon women as their<lb/> comrades in the every day work of the world.,<lb/> instead of as beings who were ideally on a level<lb/> above themselves and practically on a level con<lb/> siderably below themselves. In part there is the<lb/> growing recognition that women have conquered<lb/></other>

<page_header>LITTLE ESSAYS OF LOVE AND VIRTUE<lb/></page_header> 
<other>many elementary human rights of which before<lb/> they were deprived, and are more and more tak<lb/> ing the position of citizens, with the same kinds of<lb/> duties, privileges, and responsibilities as men. In<lb/> part, also, it may be added, there is a growing<lb/> diffusion among educated people of a knowledge<lb/> of the primary facts of life in the two sexes,<lb/> slowly dissipating and dissolving many foolish<lb/> and often mischievous superstitions. The result<lb/> is that, as many competent observers have noted,<lb/> the young men of to-day show a new attitude<lb/> towards women and towards marriage, an atti<lb/> tude of simplicity and frankness, a desire for<lb/> mutual confidence, a readiness to discuss diffi<lb/> culties, an appeal to understand and to be under<lb/> stood.<lb/> Such an attitude, which had hitherto<lb/> been hard to attain, at once creates the atmos<lb/> phere in which alone the free spontaneous erotic<lb/> activities of women can breathe and live.<lb/> This consummation, we have seen, may be re<lb/> garded as the attainment of certain rights, the<lb/> corollary of other rights in the social field which<lb/> women are slowly achieving as human beings on<lb/> the same human level as men. It opens to wo<lb/> men, on whom is always laid the chief burden<lb/> of sex, the right to the joy and exaltation of sex,<lb/> to the uplifting of the soul which, when the right<lb/> conditions are fulfilled, is the outcome of the<lb/> intimate approach and union of two human<lb/> beings. Yet while we may find convenient so to<lb/></other>

<other>formulate it, we need to remember that that is<lb/> only a fashion of speech, for there are no rights<lb/> in Nature. If we take a broader sweep, what we<lb/> may choose to call an erotic right is simply the<lb/> perfect poise of the conflicting forces of life,<lb/> the rhythmic harmony in which generation is<lb/> achieved with the highest degree of perfection<lb/> compatible with the make of the world. It is our<lb/> part to transform Nature s large conception into<lb/> our own smaller organic mould, not otherwise<lb/> than the plants, to whom we are far back akin,<lb/> who dig their flexible roots deep into the moist<lb/> and fruitful earth, and so are able to lift up<lb/> glorious heads toward the sky.<lb/></other>

<section>CHAPTER VI<lb/> THE PLAY-FUNCTION OF SEX<lb/></section> 
<other>WHEN we hear the sexual functions spoken of<lb/> we commonly understand the performance of an<lb/> act which normally tends to the propagation of<lb/> the race. When we see the question of sexual<lb/> abstinence discussed, when the desirability of<lb/> sexual gratification is asserted or denied, when<lb/> the idea arises of the erotic rights and needs of<lb/> woman, it is always the same act with its physical<lb/> results that is chiefly in mind. Such a conception<lb/> is quite adequate for practical working purposes<lb/> in the social world. It enables us to deal with<lb/> all our established human institutions in the<lb/> sphere of sex, as the arbitrary assumptions of<lb/> Euclid enable us to traverse the field of elemen<lb/> tary geometry. But beyond these useful purposes<lb/> it is inadequate and even inexact. The functions<lb/> of sex on the psychic and erotic side are of far<lb/> greater extension than any act of procreation,<lb/> they may even exclude it altogether, and when<lb/> we are concerned with the welfare of the indi<lb/> vidual human being we must enlarge our outlook<lb/> and deepen our insight.<lb/></other>

<page_header>THE PLAY-FUNCTION OF SEX<lb/></page_header>  
<page>117<lb/></page> 
<other>There are, we know, two main functions in the<lb/> sexual relationship, or what in the biological<lb/> sense we term &quot;marriage,&quot; among civilised hu<lb/> man beings, the primary physiological function<lb/> of begetting and bearing offspring and the sec<lb/> ondary spiritual function of furthering the<lb/> higher mental and emotional processes. These<lb/> are the main functions of the sexual impulse, and<lb/> in order to understand any further object of the<lb/> sexual relationship or even in order to under<lb/> stand all that is involved in the secondary object<lb/> of marriage we must go beyond conscious mo<lb/> tives and consider the nature of the sexual im<lb/> pulse, physical and psychic, as rooted in the<lb/> human organism.<lb/> The human organism, as we know, is a ma<lb/> chine on which excitations from without, stream<lb/> ing through the nerves and brain, effect internal<lb/> work, and, notably, stimulate the glandular<lb/> system.<lb/> In recent years the glandular system,<lb/> and especially that of the ductless glands, has<lb/> taken on an altogether new significance. These<lb/> ductless glands, as we know, liberate into the<lb/> blood what are termed &quot;hormones,&quot; or chemical<lb/> messengers, which have a complex but precise ac<lb/> tion in exciting and developing all those physical<lb/> and psychic activities which make up a full life<lb/> alike on the general side and the reproductive side,<lb/> so that their balanced functions are essential to<lb/></other>

<page_header>LITTLE ESSAYS OF LOVE AND VIRTUE<lb/></page_header> 
<other>wholesome and complete existence. In a rudi<lb/> mentary form these functions may be traced back<lb/> to our earliest ancestors who possessed brains.<lb/> In those times the predominant sense for arous<lb/> ing the internal mental and emotional faculties<lb/> was that of smell, the other senses being gradu<lb/> ally evolved subsequently, and it is significant<lb/> that the pituitary, one of the chief ductless glands<lb/> active in ourselves to-day, was developed out of<lb/> the nervous centre for smell in conjunction with<lb/> the membrane of the mouth. The energies of the<lb/> whole organism were set in action through<lb/> stimuli arising from the outside world by way<lb/> of the sense of smell.<lb/> In process of time the<lb/> mechanism has become immensely elaborated,<lb/> yet its healthy activity is ultimately dependent<lb/> on a rich and varied action and reaction with the<lb/> external world. It is becoming recognised that<lb/> the tendency to pluri-glandular insufficiency,<lb/> with its resulting lack of organic harmony and<lb/> equilibrium, can be counteracted by the physical<lb/> and psychic stimuli of intimate contacts with the<lb/> external world.<lb/> In this action and reaction,<lb/> moreover, we cannot distinguish between sexual<lb/> ends and general ends. The activities of the<lb/> ductless glands and their hormones equally serve<lb/> both ends in ways that cannot be distinguished.<lb/> &quot;The individual metabolism,&quot; as a distinguished<lb/> authority in this field has expressed it, &quot;is the<lb/></other>

<other>reproductive metabolism.&quot; * Thus the establish<lb/> ment of our complete activities as human beings<lb/> in the world is aided by, if not indeed ultimately<lb/> dependent upon, a perpetual and many-sided play<lb/> with our environment.<lb/> It is thus that we arrive at the importance of<lb/> the play- function, and thus, also, we realise that<lb/> while it extends beyond the sexual sphere it yet<lb/> definitely includes that sphere.<lb/> There are at<lb/> least three different ways of understanding the<lb/> biological function of play. There is the con<lb/> ception of play, on which Groos has elaborately<lb/> insisted, as education: the cat<lb/> &quot;plays&quot;<lb/> with the<lb/> mouse and is thereby educating itself in the skill<lb/> necessary to catch mice ; all our human games are<lb/> a training in qualities that are required in life,<lb/> and that is why in Englana we continue to attri<lb/> bute to the Duke of Wellington the saying that<lb/> &quot;the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing<lb/> fields of Eton.&quot; Then there is the conception of<lb/> play as the utilisation in art of the superfluous<lb/> energies left unemployed in the practical work<lb/> uf life; this enlarging and harmonising function<lb/> of play, while in the lower ranges it may be spent<lb/> trivially, leads in the higher ranges to the produc<lb/> tion of the most magnificent human achievements.<lb/> But there is yet a third conception of play,<lb/></other>

<other>according to which it exerts a direct internal<lb/> influence health-giving, developmental, and bal<lb/> ancing on the whole organism of the player<lb/> himself. This conception is related to the other<lb/> two, and yet distinct, for it is not primarily a<lb/> definite education in specific kinds of life-con<lb/> serving skill, although it may involve the acqui<lb/> sition of such skill, and it is not concerned with<lb/> the construction of objective works of art, al<lb/> though by means of contact in human relation<lb/> ship<lb/> it attains the wholesome organic effects<lb/> which may be indirectly achieved by artistic ac<lb/> tivities.<lb/> It is in this sense that we are here<lb/> concerned with what we may perhaps best call<lb/> the play-function of sex.*<lb/> As thus understood, the play-function of sex<lb/> is at once in an inseparable way both physical<lb/> and psychic. It stimulates to wholesome activity<lb/> all the complex and inter-related systems of the<lb/> organism. At the same time it satisfies the most<lb/> profound emotional impulses, controlling in har<lb/> monious poise the various mental instincts.<lb/> Along these lines it necessarily tends in the end<lb/> to go beyond its own sphere and to embrace and<lb/> introduce into the sphere of sex the other two<lb/> more objective fields of play, that of play as<lb/> education, and that of play as artistic creation.<lb/></other>

<other>It may not be true, as was said of old time, &quot;most<lb/> of our arts and sciences were invented for love s<lb/> sake.&quot;<lb/> But it is certainly true that, in proportion<lb/> as we truly and wisely exercise the play-function<lb/> of sex, we are at the same time training our per<lb/> sonality on the erotic side and acquiring a mas<lb/> tery of the art of love.<lb/> The longer I live the more I realise the im<lb/> mense importance for the individual of the de<lb/> velopment through the play-function of erotic<lb/> personality, and for human society of the ac<lb/> quirement of the art of love. At the same time<lb/> I am ever more astonished at the rarity of erotic<lb/> personality and the ignorance of the art of love<lb/> even among those men and women, experienced<lb/> in the exercise of procreation, in whom we might<lb/> most confidently expect to find such development<lb/> and such art. At times one feels hopeless at the<lb/> thought that civilisation in this supremely inti<lb/> mate field of life has yet achieved so little. For<lb/> until it is generally possible to acquire erotic per<lb/> sonality and to master the art of loving, the de<lb/> velopment of the individual man or woman is<lb/> marred, the acquirement of human happiness and<lb/> harmony remains impossible.<lb/> In entering this field, indeed, we not only have<lb/> to gain true knowledge but to cast off false<lb/> knowledge, and, above all, to purify our hearts<lb/> from superstitions which have no connection<lb/> with any kind of existing knowledge. We have<lb/></other>

<other>to cease to regard as admirable the man who re<lb/> gards the accomplishment of the procreative<lb/> act, with the pleasurable relief it affords to him<lb/> self, as the whole code of love. We have to treat<lb/> with contempt the woman who abjectly accepts<lb/> the act, and her own passivity therein, as the<lb/> whole duty of love. We have to understand tha^<lb/> the art of love has nothing to do with vice, and<lb/> the acquirement of erotic personality nothing to<lb/> do with sensuality. But we have also to realise<lb/> that the art of love is far from being the attain<lb/> ment of a refined and luxurious self-indulgence,<lb/> and the acquirement of erotic personality of little<lb/> worth unless it fortifies and enlarges the whole<lb/> personality in all its aspects.<lb/> Now all this is<lb/> difficult,, and for some people even painful; to<lb/> root up is a more serious matter than to sow; it<lb/> cannot all be done in a day.<lb/> It is not easy to form a clear picture of the<lb/> erotic life of the average man in our society. To<lb/> the best informed among us knowledge in this<lb/> field only comes slowly. Even when we have<lb/> decided what may or may not be termed &quot;aver<lb/> age&quot;<lb/> the sources of approach to this intimate<lb/> sphere remain few and misleading; at the best<lb/> the women a man loves remain far more illumi<lb/> nating sources of information than the man<lb/> himself.

<other>afford to him in the scale of virtue, his conception<lb/> of erotic personality, his ideas on the art of love,<lb/> if they have any existence at all, are of a humble<lb/> character. As to the notion of play in the sphere<lb/> of sex, even if he makes blundering attempts to<lb/> practice it, that is for him something quite low<lb/> down, something to be ashamed of, and he would<lb/> not dream of associating it with anything he has<lb/> been taught to regard as belonging to the spirit<lb/> ual sphere. The conception of &quot;divine play&quot; is<lb/> meaningless to him. His fundamental ideas, his<lb/> cherished ideals, in the erotic sphere, seem to be<lb/> reducible to two: (i) He wishes to prove that<lb/> he is &quot;a man,&quot; and he experiences what seems to<lb/> him the pride of virility in the successful attain<lb/> ment of that proof; (2) he finds in the same act<lb/> the most satisfactory method of removing sexual<lb/> tension and in the ensuing relief one of the chief<lb/> pleasures of life. It cannot be said that either<lb/> of these ideals is absolutely unsound; each is part<lb/> of the truth; it is only as a complete statement of<lb/> the truth that they become pathetically inade<lb/> quate.<lb/> It is to be noted that both of them are<lb/> based solely on the physical act of sexual con<lb/> junction, and that they are both exclusively self-<lb/> regarding. So that they are, after all, although<lb/> the nearest approach to the erotic sphere he may<lb/> be able to find, yet still not really erotic.

Here the<lb/> picture must usually be still more unsatisfactory.<lb/> The man at least, crude as we may find his two<lb/> fundamental notions to be, has at all events at<lb/> tained mental pride and physical satisfaction.<lb/> The woman often attains neither, and since the<lb/> man, by instinct or tradition, has maintained a<lb/> self-regarding attitude,, that is not surprising.<lb/> The husband by primitive instinct partly, cer<lb/> tainly by ancient tradition regards himself as<lb/> the active partner in matters of love and his own<lb/> pleasure as legitimately the prime motive for<lb/> activity.<lb/> His wife consequently falls into the<lb/> complementary position, and regards herself as<lb/> the passive partner and her pleasure as negligible,<lb/> if not indeed as a thing to be rather ashamed of,<lb/> should she by chance experience it. So that,<lb/> while the husband is content with a mere simul<lb/> acrum and pretence of the erotic life, the wife has<lb/> often had none at all.<lb/> Few people realise few indeed have the<lb/> knowledge or the opportunity to realise how<lb/> much women thus lose, alike in the means to<lb/></other>

A woman has a husband, she has marital<lb/> relationships, she has children, she has all the<lb/> usual domestic troubles it seems to the casual<lb/> observer that she has everything that constitutes<lb/> a fully developed matron fit to play her proper<lb/> part in the home and in the world. Yet with all<lb/> these experiences, which undoubtedly are an im<lb/> portant part of life, she may yet remain on the<lb/> emotional side and, as a matter of fact, fre<lb/> quently remains quite virginal, as immature as<lb/> a school-girl. She has not acquired an erotic<lb/> personality, she has not mastered the art of love,<lb/> with the result that her whole nature remains<lb/> ill-developed and unharmonised, and that she is<lb/> incapable of bringing her personality having<lb/> indeed no achieved personality to bring to bear<lb/> effectively on the problems of society and the<lb/> world around her.<lb/> That alone is a great misfortune, all the more<lb/> tragic since under favourable conditions, which<lb/> it should have been natural to attain, it might so<lb/> easily be avoided. But there is this further re<lb/> sult, full of the possibilities of domestic tragedy,<lb/> that the wife so situated, however innocent, how<lb/> ever virtuous, may at any time find her virginally<lb/> sensitive emotional nature fertilised by the touch<lb/> of some other man than her husband.<lb/> It happens so often.

But during all this time the<lb/> husband has never really made love to his wife;<lb/> he has not even understood what courtship in the<lb/> intimate sense means; love as an art has no ex<lb/> istence for him; he has loved his wife according<lb/> to his imperfect knowledge, but he has never so<lb/> much as realised that his knowledge was imper<lb/> fect.<lb/> She on her side loves her husband; she<lb/> comes in time indeed to have a sort of tender<lb/> maternal feeling for him. Possibly she feels a<lb/> little pleasure in intercourse with him. But she<lb/> has never once been profoundly aroused, and she<lb/> has never once been utterly satisfied. The deep<lb/> fountains of her nature have never been un<lb/> sealed; she has never been fertilised throughout<lb/> her whole nature by their liberating influence;<lb/> her erotic personality has never been developed.<lb/></other>

<other>Then something happens. Perhaps the husband<lb/> is called away, it may have been to take part in<lb/> the Great War. The wife, whatever her tender<lb/> solicitude for her absent partner, feels her soli<lb/> tude and is drawn nearer to friends, perhaps her<lb/> husband s friends. Some man among them be<lb/> comes congenial to her. There need be no con<lb/> scious or overt love-making on either side, and if<lb/> there were the wife s loyalty might be aroused<lb/> and the friendship brought to an end. Love-<lb/> making is not indeed necessary. The wife s latent<lb/> erotic needs, while still remaining unconscious,<lb/> have come nearer to the surface; now that she<lb/> has grown mature and that they have been<lb/> stimulated yet unsatisfied for so long, they have,<lb/> trnknown to herself, become insistent and sensi<lb/> tive to a sympathetic touch. The friends may<lb/> indeed grow into lovers, and then some sort of<lb/> solution, by divorce or intrigue scarcely how<lb/> ever a desirable kind of solution becomes pos<lb/> sible.<lb/> But we are here taking the highest ground<lb/> and assuming that honourable feeling, domestic<lb/> affection, or a stern sense of moral duty, renders<lb/> such solution unacceptable. In due course the<lb/> husband returns, and then, to her utter dismay,<lb/> the wife discovers, if she has not discovered it<lb/> before, that during his absence, and for the first<lb/> time in her life, she has fallen in love.<lb/> She<lb/> loyally confesses the situation to her husband,,<lb/> for whom her affection and attachment remain<lb/></other>

<other>the same as before, for what has happened to her<lb/> is the coming of a totally new kind of love and<lb/> not any change in her old love. The situation<lb/> which arises is one of torturing anxiety for all<lb/> concerned, and it is not less so when all con<lb/> cerned are animated by noble and self-sacrificing<lb/> impulses.<lb/> The husband in his devotion to his<lb/> wife may even be willing that her new impulses<lb/> should be gratified. She, on her side, will not<lb/> think of yielding to desires which seem both<lb/> unfair to her husband and opposed to all her<lb/> moral traditions. We are not here concerned to<lb/> consider the most likely, or the most desirable,<lb/> exit from this unfortunate situation. The points<lb/> to note are that it is a situation which to-day<lb/> actually occurs ; that it causes acute unhappiness<lb/> to at least two people who may be of the finest<lb/> physical and intellectual type and the noblest<lb/> character, and that it might be avoided if there<lb/> were at the outset a proper understanding of the<lb/> married state and of the part which the art of<lb/> love plays in married happiness and the develop<lb/> ment of personality.<lb/> A woman may have been married once,, she<lb/> may have been married twice, she may have had<lb/> children by both husbands, and yet it may not be<lb/> until she is past the age of thirty and is united<lb/> to a third man that she attains the development<lb/> of erotic personality and all that it involves in<lb/> the full flowering of her whole nature.

Now she has be<lb/> come another person. The new liberated forces<lb/> from within have not only enabled her to become<lb/> sensitive to the rich complexities of intimate per<lb/> sonal relationship, they have enlarged and har<lb/> monised her realisation of all relationships. Her<lb/> new erotic experience has not only stimulated all<lb/> her energies, but her new knowledge has quick<lb/> ened all her sympathies. She feels, at the same<lb/> time, more mentally alert, and she finds that she<lb/> is more alive than before to the influences of<lb/> nature and of art. Moreover, as others observe,<lb/> however they may explain it, a new beauty has<lb/> come into her face, a new radiancy into her ex<lb/> pression, a new force into all her activities. Such<lb/> is the exquisite flowering of love which some of<lb/> us who may penetrate beneath the surface of life<lb/> are now and then privileged to see. The sad part<lb/> of it is that we see it so seldom and then often<lb/> so late.<lb/> It must not be supposed that there is any direct<lb/> or speedy way of introducing into life a wider<lb/> and dper conception of the erotic play- function,<lb/> and all that it means for the development of the<lb/></other>

It<lb/> is only slowly and indirectly that we can bring<lb/> about the revolution which in this direction<lb/> would renew life. We may prepare the way for<lb/> it by undermining and destroying those degrad<lb/> ing traditional conceptions which have persisted<lb/> so long that they are instilled into us almost from<lb/> birth, to work like a virus in the heart, and to<lb/> become almost a disease of the soul. To make<lb/> way for the true and beautiful revelation, we<lb/> can at least seek to cast out those ancient<lb/> growths, which may once have been true and<lb/> beautiful, but now are false and poisonous. By<lb/> casting out from us the conception of love as vile<lb/> and unclean we shall purify the chambers of our<lb/> hearts for the reception of love as something un<lb/> speakably holy.<lb/> In this matter we may learn a lesson from the<lb/> psycho-analysts of to-day without any implica<lb/> tion that psycho-analysis is necessarily a desir<lb/> able or even possible way of attaining the<lb/> revelation of love.<lb/> The wiser psycho-analysts<lb/> insist that the process of liberating the individual<lb/> from outer and inner influences that repress or<lb/> deform his energies and impulses is effected by<lb/> removing the inhibitions on the free-play of his<lb/> nature. It is a process of education in the true<lb/></other>

Play is<lb/> primarily the instinctive work of the brain, but<lb/> it is brain activity united in the subtlest way to<lb/> bodily activity. In the play- function of sex two<lb/> forms of activity, physical and psychic, are most<lb/> exquisitely and variously and harmoniously<lb/> blended. We here understand best how it is that<lb/> the brain organs and the sexual organs are, from<lb/> the physiological standpoint, of equal importance<lb/> and equal dignity. Thus the adrenal glands,<lb/> among the most influential of all the ductless<lb/> glands, are specially and intimately associated<lb/> alike with the brain and the sex organs. As we<lb/> rise in the animal series, brain and adrenal glands<lb/> march side by side in developmental increase of<lb/> size, and at the same time, sexual activity and<lb/> adrenal activity equally correspond.<lb/> Lovers in their play when they have been<lb/> liberated from the traditions which bound them<lb/> to the trivial or the gross conception of play in<lb/> love are thus moving amongst the highest<lb/> human activities, alike of the body and of the<lb/> soul.<lb/> They are passing to each other the sacra<lb/> mental chalice of that wine which imparts the<lb/> deepest joy that men and women can know.

<section>CHAPTER VII<lb/> THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE RACE<lb/></section> 
<other>THE relation of the individual person to the<lb/> species he belongs to is the most intimate of all<lb/> relations. It is a relation which almost amounts<lb/> to identity. Yet it somehow seems so vague, so<lb/> abstract, as scarcely to concern us at all. It is<lb/> only lately indeed that there has been formulated<lb/> even so much as a science to discuss this relation<lb/> ship, and the duties which, when properly under<lb/> stood, it throws upon the individual. Even yet the<lb/> word &quot;Eugenics,&quot; the name of this science, and<lb/> this art, sometimes arouses a smile. It seems to<lb/> stand for a modern fad, which the superior per<lb/> son, or even the ordinary plebeian democrat, may<lb/> pass by on the other side with his nose raised<lb/> towards the sky. Modern the science and art of<lb/> Eugenics certainly seem, though the term is<lb/> ancient, and the Greeks of classic days, as well as<lb/> their successors to-day, used the word Eugeneia<lb/> for nobility or good birth. It was chosen by<lb/> Francis Galton, less than fifty years ago,, to ex<lb/> press &quot;the effort of Man to improve his own<lb/></other>

<other>breed.&quot;<lb/> But the thing the term stands for is,<lb/> in reality, also far from modern. It is indeed<lb/> ancient and may even be nearly as old as Man<lb/> himself.<lb/> Consciously or unconsciously, some<lb/> times under pretexts that have disguised his<lb/> motives even from himself, Man has always been<lb/> attempting to improve his own quality or at least<lb/> to maintain it. When he slackens that effort,<lb/> when he allows his attention to be too exclusively<lb/> drawn to other ends, he suffers, he becomes de<lb/> cadent, he even tends to die out.<lb/> Primitive eugenics had seldom anything to do<lb/> with what we call &quot;birth-control.&quot; One must not<lb/> say that it never had. Even the mysterious mika<lb/> operation of so primitive a race as the Austral<lb/> ians has been supposed to be a method of con<lb/> trolling conception. But the usual method, even<lb/> of people highly advanced in culture, has been<lb/> simpler.<lb/> They preferred to see the new-born<lb/> infant before deciding whether it was likely to<lb/> prove a credit to its parents or to the human race<lb/> generally, and if it seemed not up to the standard<lb/> they dealt with it accordingly. At one time that<lb/> was regarded as a cruel and even inhuman<lb/> method. To-day, when the most civilised nations<lb/> of the world have devoted all their best energies to<lb/> competitive slaughter, we may have learnt to<lb/> view the matter differently. If we can tolerate<lb/> the wholesale murder and mutilation of the finest<lb/> specimens of our race in the adult possession of<lb/></other>

<other>all their aptitudes we cannot easily find anything<lb/> to disapprove in the merciful disposal of the<lb/> poorest specimens before they have even attained<lb/> conscious possession of their senses. But in any<lb/> case, and whatever we may ourselves be pleased<lb/> to think or not to think, it is certain that some of<lb/> the most highly developed peoples of the world<lb/> have practised infanticide. It is equally certain<lb/> that the practise has not proved destructive to<lb/> the emotions of humanity and affection. Even<lb/> some of the lowest human races, as we com<lb/> monly estimate them, while finding it necessary<lb/> to put aside a certain proportion of their new<lb/> born infants, expend a degree of love and even<lb/> indulgence on the children they bring up which<lb/> is rarely found among so-called civilised nations.<lb/> There is no need, however, to consider whether<lb/> or not infanticide is humane. We are all agreed<lb/> that it is altogether unnecessary, and that it is<lb/> seldom that even that incipient form of in<lb/> fanticide called abortion, still so popular among<lb/> us, need be resorted to. Our aim now so far<lb/> at all events as mere ideals go is not to destroy<lb/> life but to preserve it; we seek to improve the<lb/> conditions of life and to render unnecessary the<lb/> premature death of any human creature that<lb/> has once drawn breath.<lb/> It is indeed just here that we find a certain<lb/> clash between the modern view of life and the<lb/> view of earlier civilisations. The ancients were<lb/></other>

<other>less careful than we claim to be of the individual,<lb/> but they were more careful of the race. They<lb/> cultivated eugenics after their manner, though<lb/> it was a manner which we reprobate.* We pride<lb/> ourselves, rightly or wrongly, on our care for<lb/> the individual; during all the past century we<lb/> claim to have been strenuously working for an<lb/> amelioration of the environment which will make<lb/> life healthier and pleasanter for the individual.<lb/> But in the concentration of pur attention on this<lb/> altogether desirable end, which we are still far<lb/> from having adequately attained, we have lost<lb/> sight of that larger end, the well-being of the<lb/> race and the amelioration of life itself, not merely<lb/> of the conditions of life. The most we hope is<lb/> that somehow the improvement of the conditions<lb/> of the individual will incidentally improve the<lb/> stock.<lb/> These our practical ideals, which have<lb/> flourished for a century past, arose out of the<lb/> great French Revolution and were inspired by<lb/> the maxim of that Revolution, as formulated by<lb/> Rousseau,, that &quot;All men are born equal.&quot; That<lb/></other> 
<page_footnote>* But this statement must not be left without important<lb/> qualification.<lb/> Thus the ancient Greeks (as Moissides has shown<lb/> in Janus, 1913), not only their philosophers and statesmen but<lb/> also their women, often took the most enlightened interest in<lb/> eugenics, and, moreover, showed it in practice. They were m<lb/> many respects far in advance of us. They clearly realised for<lb/> Instance, the need of a proper interval between conceptions,<lb/> not only to ensure the health of women, but also the vigour of<lb/> the offspring. It is natural that among every fine race eugenics<lb/> should be almost an instinct or they would cease to be a fine<lb/> race<lb/> It is equally natural that among our modern degenerates<lb/> Sgenics is an unspeakable horror, however much, as the psycho<lb/> analysts would put it, they rationalise that horror.<lb/></page_footnote>

<page_header>LITTLE ESSAYS OF LOVE AND VIRTUE<lb/></page_header> 
<other>maxim was overthrown half a century ago; the<lb/> great biological movement of science, initiated<lb/> by Darwin, showed that it was untenable. All<lb/> men are not born equal. Everyone agrees about<lb/> that now, but nevertheless the momentum of the<lb/> earlier movement was so powerful that we still<lb/> go on acting as though all men are, and always<lb/> will be, born equal, and that we need not trouble<lb/> ourselves about heredity but only about the en<lb/> vironment.<lb/> The way out of this clash of ideals which has<lb/> compelled us to hope impossibilities from the en<lb/> vironment because we dreaded what seemed the<lb/> only alternative is, as we know, furnished by<lb/> birth-control. An unqualified reliance on the en<lb/> vironment, making it ever easier and easier for<lb/> the feeblest and most defective to be born and<lb/> survive, could only, in the long run, lead to the<lb/> degeneration of the whole race. The knowledge<lb/> of the practice of birth-control gives us the mas<lb/> tery of all that the ancients gained by infanticide,<lb/> while yet enabling us to cherish that ideal of the<lb/> sacredness of human life which we profess to<lb/> honour so highly. The main difficulty is that it<lb/> demands a degree of scientific precision which<lb/> the ancients could not possess and might dispense<lb/> with, so long as they were able to decide the<lb/> eugenic claims of the infant by actual inspection.<lb/> We have to be content to determine not what the<lb/> infant is but what it would be likelv to be, and<lb/></other>

To such<lb/> observations Galton attached great importance<lb/> and strove in various ways to further them. De<lb/> tailed records, physical and mental, beginning<lb/> from birth, are still far from being as common<lb/> as is desirable, although it is obvious that they<lb/> possess a permanent personal and family private<lb/> interest in addition to their more public scientific<lb/> value. We do not need, and it would indeed be<lb/> undesirable, to emulate in human breeding the<lb/> achievements of a Luther Burbank. We have<lb/> no right to attempt to impose on any human<lb/> creature an exaggerated and one-sided develop<lb/> ment. But it is not only our right, it is our duty,<lb/> or rather one may say, the natural impulse of<lb/> every rational and humane person, to seek that<lb/> only such children may be born as will be able<lb/> to go through life with a reasonable prospect<lb/> that they will not be heavily handicapped by<lb/> inborn defect or special liability to some incapaci<lb/> tating disease.<lb/> What is called &quot;positive&quot;<lb/> eugenics the attempt, that is, to breed special<lb/> qualities<lb/> may well be viewed with hesitation.<lb/> But so-called &quot;negative&quot; eugenics the effort to<lb/> clear all inborn obstacles out of the path of the<lb/></other>

<other>coming generation demands our heartiest sym<lb/> pathy and our best co-operation, for as Galton,<lb/> the founder of modern Eugenics, wrote towards<lb/> the end of his life of this new science: &quot;Its first<lb/> object is to check the birth-rate of the unfit,<lb/> instead of allowing them to come into being,<lb/> though doomed in large numbers to perish pre<lb/> maturely.&quot;<lb/> We can seldom be absolutely sure<lb/> what stocks should not propagate, and what two<lb/> stocks should on no account be blended, but we<lb/> can attain reasonable probability, and it is on<lb/> such probabilities in every department of life that<lb/> we are always called upon to act.<lb/> It is often said I have said it myself that<lb/> birth-control when practised merely as a limita<lb/> tion of the family, scarcely suffices to further the<lb/> eugenic progress of the race.<lb/> If it is not de<lb/> liberately directed towards the elimination of the<lb/> worst stocks or the worst possibilities in the<lb/> blending of stocks, it may even tend to diminish<lb/> the better stocks since it is the better stocks that<lb/> are least likely to propagate at random. This is<lb/> true if other conditions remain equal.<lb/> It is<lb/> evident, however, that the other conditions will<lb/> not remain equal, for no evidence has yet been<lb/> brought forward to show that birth-control, even<lb/> when practised without regard to eugenic con<lb/> siderations<lb/> doubtless the usual rule up to the<lb/> present has produced any degeneration of the<lb/> race.<lb/> On the contrary, the evidence seems to<lb/></other>

<other>show that it has improved the race. The example<lb/> of Holland is often brought forward as evidence<lb/> in favour of such a tendency of birth-control,<lb/> since in that country the wide-spread practise of<lb/> birth-control has been accompanied by an increase<lb/> in the health and stature of the people, as well as<lb/> an increase in their numbers to a remarkable de<lb/> gree, for the fall in the birth-rate has been far<lb/> more than compensated by the fall in the death-<lb/> rate,, while it is said that the average height of<lb/> the population has increased by four inches. It<lb/> is, indeed, quite possible to see why, although<lb/> theoretically a random application of birth-<lb/> control cannot affect the germinal possibilities of<lb/> a community, in practise it may improve the<lb/> somatic conditions under which the germinal<lb/> elements develop.<lb/> There will probably be a<lb/> longer interval between the births of the children,<lb/> which has been demonstrated by Ewart and<lb/> others to be an important factor not only in<lb/> preserving the health of the mother but in in<lb/> creasing the health and size of the child. The<lb/> diminution in the number of the children renders<lb/> it possible to bestow a greater amount of care<lb/> on each child. Moreover, the better economic<lb/> position of the father, due to the smaller number<lb/> of individuals he has to support., makes it possible<lb/> for the family to live under improved conditions<lb/> as regards nourishment, hygiene, and comfort.<lb/> The observance of birth-control is thus a far<lb/></other>

<page_header>LITTLE ESSAYS OF LOVE AND VIRTUE<lb/></page_header> 
<other>more effective lever for raising the state of the<lb/> social environment and improving the conditions<lb/> of breeding, than is direct action on the part of<lb/> the community in its collective capacity to attain<lb/> the same end. For however energetic such col<lb/> lective action may be in striving to improve<lb/> general social conditions by municipalising or<lb/> State-supporting public utilities, it can never<lb/> adequately counter-balance the excessive burden<lb/> and wasteful expenditure of force placed on a<lb/> family by undue child-production. It can only<lb/> palliate them.<lb/> When, however, we have found reason to be<lb/> lieve that, even if practised without regard to<lb/> eugenic considerations, birth-control may yet act<lb/> beneficially to promote good breeding, we begin<lb/> to realise how great a power it may possess when<lb/> consciously and deliberately directed towards<lb/> that end.<lb/> In eugenics, as already pointed out,<lb/> there are two objects that may be aimed at: one<lb/> called positive eugenics, that seeks to promote<lb/> the increase of the best stocks amongst us; the<lb/> other, called negative eugenics, which seeks to<lb/> promote the decrease of the worst stocks. Our<lb/> knowledge is still too imperfect to enable us to<lb/> pursue either of these objects with complete cer<lb/> tainty.<lb/> This is especially so as regards positive<lb/> eugenics, and since it seems highly undesirable to<lb/> attempt to breed human beings, as we do animals,<lb/> for points, when we are in the presence of what<lb/></other>

The<lb/> best stocks will probably be also those best able<lb/> to help themselves and in so doing to help others.<lb/> But that is obviously not so as regards the worst<lb/> stocks.<lb/> It is, therefore, fortunate that the aim<lb/> here seems a little clearer. There are still many<lb/> abnormal conditions of which we cannot say<lb/> positively that they are injurious to the race and<lb/> that we should therefore seek to breed them out.<lb/> But there are other conditions so obviously of<lb/> evil import alike to the subjects themselves and<lb/> to their descendants that we cannot have any<lb/> reasonable doubt about them.<lb/> There is, for<lb/> instance, epilepsy, which is known to be trans<lb/> formed by heredity into various abnormalities<lb/> dangerous alike to their possessors and to so<lb/> ciety.<lb/> There are also the pronounced degrees of<lb/> feeble-mindedness, which are definitely heritable<lb/> and not only condemn those who reveal them to<lb/> a permanent inaptitude for full life, but consti<lb/> tute a subtle poison working through the social<lb/> atmosphere in all directions and lowering the level<lb/> of civilisation in the community. Nowhere has<lb/> this been so thoroughly studied and so clearly<lb/> proved as in the United States. It is only neces<lb/> sary to mention Dr. C. B. Davenport of the<lb/> Department of Experimental Evolution at Cold<lb/> Spring Harbor (New York) who has carried on<lb/></other>

<page_header>LITTLE ESSAYS OF LOVE AND VIRTUE<lb/></page_header>

<other>It is not scientific research alone, nor even the<lb/> wide popular diffusion of knowledge, that will<lb/> suffice to bring eugenics and birth-control, singly<lb/> or in their due combination, into the course of<lb/> our daily lives. They need to be embodied in our<lb/> instinctive impulses.<lb/> Gallon considered that<lb/> eugenics must become a factor of religion and<lb/> be regarded as a sacred and virile creed, while<lb/> Ellen Key holds that the religions of the past<lb/> must be superseded by a new religion which will<lb/> be the awakening of the whole of humanity to<lb/> a consciousness of the &quot;holiness of generation.&quot;<lb/> For my own part, I scarcely consider that either<lb/> eugenics or birth-control can be regarded as<lb/> properly a part of religion. Being of virtue and<lb/> not of grace they belong more naturally to the<lb/> sphere of morals. But here they certainly need<lb/> to go far deeper than the mere intelligence of the<lb/> mind can take them. They cannot become guides<lb/> to conduct until their injunctions have been<lb/> printed on the fleshy tablets of our hearts. The<lb/> demands of the race must speak from within us,<lb/> in the voice of conscience which we disobey at<lb/> our peril. When that happens with regard to<lb/> ascertained laws of racial well-being we may<lb/> know that we are truly following, even though not<lb/> in the letter, those great spirits, like Galton with<lb/> his intellectual vision and Ellen Key with her<lb/> inspired enthusiasm, who have pointed out new<lb/> roads for the ennoblement of the race.<lb/></other>

<other>It may be well, before we go further, to look<lb/> a little more closely into the suspicion and dis<lb/> like which eugenics still arouses in many worthy<lb/> old-fashioned people. To some extent that atti<lb/> tude is excused, not only by the mistakes which<lb/> in a new and complex science must inevitably be<lb/> made even by painstaking students, but also by<lb/> the rash and extravagant proposals of irrespon<lb/> sible and eccentric persons claiming without<lb/> warrant to speak in the name of eugenics. Two<lb/> thousand years ago the wild excesses of some<lb/> early Christians furnished an excuse for the<lb/> ancient world to view Christianity with con<lb/> tempt, although the extreme absence of such<lb/> excesses has furnished still better ground for the<lb/> modern world to maintain the same view. To-day<lb/> such a work as Le Haras Humain (&quot;The Human<lb/> Stud- farm&quot;) of Dr. Binet-Sangle, putting for<lb/> ward proposals which, whether beneficial or not,<lb/> will certainly find no one to carry them out,,<lb/> similarly furnishes an excuse to those who would<lb/> reject eugenics altogether.<lb/> Utopian schemes<lb/> have their value; we should be able to find in<lb/> spiration in the most modern of them, just as we<lb/> still do in Plato s immortal Republic. But in this,<lb/> as in other matters, we must exercise a little<lb/> intelligence.<lb/> We must not confuse the brilliant<lb/> excursion of some solitary thinker with the well-<lb/></other>

People who are incapable of exercis<lb/> ing a little shrewd commonsense in the affairs<lb/> of life, and are in the habit of emptying out the<lb/> baby with the bath, had better avoid touching the<lb/> delicate problems connected with practical eu<lb/> genics.<lb/> There is one prejudice already mentioned, due<lb/> to lack of clear thinking, which deserves more<lb/> special consideration because it is widespread<lb/> among the socialistic democracy of several coun<lb/> tries as well as among social reformers, and is<lb/> directed alike against eugenics and birth-control.<lb/> This prejudice is based on the ground that bad<lb/> economic conditions and an unwholesome en<lb/> vironment are the source of all social evils, and<lb/> that a better distribution of wealth, or a vast<lb/> scheme of social welfare, is the one thing neces<lb/> sary, when that is achieved all other things being<lb/> added unto us, without any further trouble on<lb/> our part. It is certainly impossible to over-rate<lb/> the importance of the economic factor in society,<lb/> or of a good environment. And it is true that<lb/> eugenics alone, like birth-control alone, can effect<lb/> little if the economic basis of society is unsound.<lb/> But it is equally certain that the economic factor<lb/> can never in itself suffice for fine living or even<lb/> as a cure-all of social and racial diseases.

The social group, after<lb/> all, is merely himself and the likes of himself.<lb/> He is merely shifting the burden from his in<lb/> dividual self to his collective self, and in so doing<lb/> he loses more than he gains.<lb/> Thus there is always a sound core in that In<lb/> dividualism which has been preached so long and<lb/> practised so energetically, especially in English-<lb/> speaking lands, however great the abuse involved<lb/> in its excesses. It is still in the name of Indi<lb/> vidualism that the most brilliant antagonists of<lb/> eugenics and of birth-control are wont to direct<lb/> their attacks.<lb/> The counsel of self-control and<lb/> foresight in procreation, the restriction necessary<lb/> to purify and raise the standard of the race, seem<lb/> to the narrow and short-sighted advocates of a<lb/> great principle an unwarrantable violation of the<lb/> sacred rights of their individual liberty.

For<lb/> if, in accordance with the most careful modern<lb/> investigations,, we recognise that heredity is<lb/> supreme, that the qualities we have inherited<lb/> from our ancestors count for more in our lives<lb/> than anything we have acquired by our own<lb/> personal efforts, then we have to admit that the<lb/> capable man s wealth is more the community s<lb/> property than his own, and, similarly, the in<lb/> capable man s poverty is more the community s<lb/> concern than his own.

<other>we shall be face to face, without possibility of<lb/> doubt, with bad inheritance as the sole remaining<lb/> factor in the production of inefficient and anti<lb/> social members of the community. A socialist<lb/> community must recognise the right to work and<lb/> to maintenance of all its members, Eden Paul<lb/> points out, but, he adds, a community which<lb/> allowed this right to all defectives without im<lb/> posing any restrictions in their perpetuation of<lb/> themselves would deserve all the evils that would<lb/> fall upon it. It is quite clear how intolerable the<lb/> burden of these evils would be. A State that<lb/> provided an adequate subsistence for all alike, the<lb/> inefficient as well as the efficient, would encour<lb/> age a racial degeneration, from excessive multi<lb/> plication of the unfit, far more dangerous even<lb/> than that of to-day.* Ability to earn the mini<lb/> mum wage, Eden Paul argues in agreement with<lb/> H.

<other>Thus it is essential that the eugenist, dealing<lb/> with the hereditary factor of life, and the social<lb/> reformer or socialist, dealing with the environ<lb/> mental factor, should supplement each other s<lb/> work. Neither can attain his end without the<lb/> other s help, for the eugenist alone cannot over<lb/> come the environmental factor, even perhaps<lb/> increases it if he is an individualist in the narrow<lb/> sense, and the socialist alone cannot overcome<lb/> the bad hereditary factor, and will even increase<lb/> it if he is no more than a socialist. The more<lb/> socialist our State becomes the more essential<lb/> becomes at the same time the adoption of eugenic<lb/> practices as a working part of the State. &quot;So<lb/> cialism and eugenics must go hand in hand.&quot;<lb/> Perrycoste from his own point of view has<lb/> independently reached the same conclusions. He<lb/> is not, indeed, concerned with any &quot;Socialist&quot;<lb/> community of the future but with the dangerous<lb/> results which must inevitably follow the already<lb/> established methods of social reform in our<lb/> modern civilised States unless they are speedily<lb/> checked by effective action based on eugenic<lb/> knowledge. &quot;If,&quot; he observes, &quot;the community<lb/> is to shoulder half or three-quarters of the<lb/> burden of sustaining those degenerates who,<lb/> through no fault of their own, are congenitally<lb/> incompetent to maintain themselves in decent<lb/> comfort, and is to render the life-pilgrimage of<lb/> these unfortunates tolerable instead of a dreary<lb/></other>

<other>raised in tones of virtuous indignation to de<lb/> nounce the same crime.

<other>faced by those who have most vehemently raised<lb/> that cry.<lb/> Translated into more definite and<lb/> precise terms this cry means, and is intended to<lb/> mean: &quot;We want more births.&quot; That is what<lb/> it definitely means, and sometimes in the minds<lb/> of those who make this demand it seems also to<lb/> imply nothing more. Yet it implies a great num<lb/> ber of other things. It implies certain strain and<lb/> probable ill-health on the mothers, it implies<lb/> distress and disorder in the family, it implies,<lb/> even if the additional child survives, a more acute<lb/> industrial struggle, and it further involves in this<lb/> case, by the stimulus it gives to over-population,<lb/> the perpetual menace of militarism and war.<lb/> What, however, even at the outset, more births<lb/> most distinctly and most unquestionably imply<lb/> is more deaths. It is nowadays so well known<lb/> that a high birth-rate is accompanied by a high<lb/> death-rate the exceptions are too few to need<lb/> attention<lb/> that it is unnecessary to adduce fur<lb/> ther evidence.<lb/> It is only the intoxicated en<lb/> thusiasts of the &quot;Race-Suicide&quot; cry who are able<lb/> to overlook a fact of which they can hardly be<lb/> ignorant.<lb/> The model which they hold up for<lb/> the public s inspiration has on the obverse &quot;More<lb/> Births!&quot;<lb/> But on the reverse it bears &quot;More<lb/> Deaths !&quot; It would be helpful to the public, and<lb/> might even be wholesome for our enthusiasts<lb/> own enlightenment, if they would occasionally<lb/> turn the medal round and slightly vary the<lb/></other>

It is obvious that we must consider both<lb/> gains and losses, and put one against the other,<lb/> if we wish to ascertain the net result. We may<lb/> roughly get a notion of what that result is by<lb/> deducting the death-rate from the birth-rate and<lb/> calling the remainder the survival-rate. If we<lb/> are really concerned with the question of the<lb/> alleged suicide of the race, and do not wish to be<lb/> befooled, we must pay little attention to the<lb/> birth-rate, for that by itself means nothing: we<lb/> must concentrate on the survival-rate. Then we<lb/> may soon convince ourselves, not only that the<lb/> human race is not committing suicide, but that<lb/> not even a single one of the so-called civilised<lb/> nations of which it is mainly composed is com<lb/> mitting suicide.

<other>cide&quot; is supposed to be most actively at work, is<lb/> yearly increasing in numbers.<lb/> It is interesting to note, moreover, that the<lb/> French have been increasing faster, that is to<lb/> say the survival-rate has been higher in recent<lb/> years just before the war, when the birth-rate<lb/> was at its lowest, than they were twenty years<lb/> earlier, with a higher birth-rate. And if we take<lb/> a wider sweep and consider the growth of the<lb/> French population towards the end of the eight<lb/> eenth century, we find the birth-rate estimated<lb/> at the very high figure of 40. But the death-rate<lb/> was nearly as high, the average duration of life<lb/> was only half what it is now. So that the<lb/> survival-rate in France at that time, with widely<lb/> different rates of birth and death, was not much<lb/> unlike it is now. The recent French birth-rate<lb/> of 19 and less, which automatically causes<lb/> the &quot;Race-Suicide&quot; marionette to dance with<lb/> rage,, is producing not far from the same result<lb/> in growth of the population we are not here<lb/> concerned with the enormous difference in well<lb/> being and happiness as the extremely high rate<lb/> of 40 which sends our marionettes leaping to the<lb/> sky with joy. In war-time England, in 1917,<lb/> the birth-rate sank to 17.8, yet the death-rate<lb/> was at 14 and the increase of the population con<lb/> tinued.

<other>It is, however, in the New World as in Can<lb/> ada, Australia, and New Zealand that we find<lb/> the most impressive evidence of the real criteria<lb/> of the growth in population set up for judgment<lb/> on the racial suicide cranks. Canadian statistics<lb/> bring out many points instructive even in their<lb/> variation. Here we see not only unusual curves<lb/> of rise and fall, but also pronounced differences,<lb/> due to the special peculiarities of the French<lb/> population, most clearly in the Province of<lb/> Quebec but also in some parts of the Province of<lb/> Ontario. In Quebec the birth-rate some years<lb/> ago was 35,, and the death-rate 21, both rates<lb/> high, and the survival-rate high at 14; recently<lb/> the birth-rate has risen to 37 and the death-rate<lb/> fallen to 17, with the result that the survival-rate<lb/> of 20 is the highest in the world, though it must<lb/> be noted that the high birth-rate is not likely to<lb/> last long, since in Quebec, as elsewhere in the<lb/> world, increasing urbanisation causes a decreas<lb/> ing birth-rate.<lb/> In mainly English-speaking<lb/> Ontario the birth-rate is much lower, about 24,<lb/> but the death-rate is also lower, about 14, so that<lb/> the fairly considerable survival-rate of 10 is ob<lb/> tained.<lb/> But we note the highly significant fact<lb/> that some thirty years or more ago the birth-rate<lb/> was much lower, about 19, and yet the sur<lb/> vival-rate was almost 9, nearly as high as to-day !<lb/> The death-rate was then at 10, and nothing could<lb/> be more instructive as to the real relationship<lb/></other>

<other>that holds in this matter. There has been a great<lb/> rise in the birth-rate and the only result, as<lb/> someone has remarked, is a great increase in the<lb/> population of the grave-yards. Equally instruc<lb/> tive is it to compare various cities in this same<lb/> Province, living under the same laws, and fairly<lb/> similar social conditions.<lb/> In the report of the<lb/> Registrar-General of Ontario for 1916 I find that<lb/> highest in birth-rate of cities in the Province<lb/> stands Ottawa with a very considerable French<lb/> population.<lb/> But first also stands the same city<lb/> for infant mortality, which is three times<lb/> greater than in some other cities in the Province<lb/> with a low birth-rate. Sault Ste. Marie, again<lb/> with an enormous birth-rate, stands third for<lb/> infant mortality.<lb/> Canada shows us that, even<lb/> if we regard the crude desire for a large growth<lb/> of population as reasonable and that is a con<lb/> siderable assumption a high birth-rate is an<lb/> uncertain prop to rest on.<lb/> Canada is an instructive example because we<lb/> have some ground for believing that the differ<lb/> ence between the English-speaking and French-<lb/> speaking populations the greater care of the<lb/> former in procreation and the more recklessly<lb/> destructive methods of the latter in attaining the<lb/> same ends are due to their different attitudes<lb/> towards the use of methods of birth-control.<lb/> What the result of a general use of such methods<lb/> is we know from the example already mentioned<lb/></other>

So that the<lb/> more the birth-rate has fallen the higher has<lb/> been the rate of increase among the population.<lb/> It is perhaps in Australia and New Zealand<lb/> that we find the most satisfactory proofs of the<lb/> benefits of a falling birth-rate in relation to<lb/> &quot;Race-Suicide.&quot;<lb/> The evidence may well appeal<lb/> to us the more since it is precisely here that the<lb/> race-suicide fanatic finds freest scope for his<lb/> wrath.<lb/> He looks gleefully at China with its<lb/> prolific women, at Russia with its magnificent<lb/> birth-rate before the War of nearly 50, at<lb/> Roumania with its birth-rate of 42, at Chile and<lb/> Jamaica with nearly 40.<lb/> No nonsense about<lb/> birth-control there!<lb/> No shirking by women of<lb/> the sacred duties of perpetual maternity!<lb/> No<lb/> immoral notions about claims to happiness and<lb/> desires for culture.<lb/> And then he turns from<lb/> those great centres of prosperity and civilisation<lb/> to Australia, to New Zealand, and his voice is<lb/> choked and tears fill his eyes as he sees the goal<lb/> of &quot;Race-Suicide&quot; nearly in sight and the spectre<lb/> of the Last Man rising before him.

The result is that Australia and New<lb/> Zealand, where (so it is claimed) preventives of<lb/> conception are hawked from door to door, in<lb/> stead of being awful examples of &quot;Race-Suicide,&quot;<lb/> actually present the highest rate of race-increase<lb/> in the world (only excepting Canada, where it is<lb/> less firmly and less healthily based), nearly twice<lb/> that of Great Britain and able at the present rate<lb/> to double itself every 44 years.
