                <p>Today's architectures for intrusion detection force the IDS designer to make a difficult choice. If
                    the IDS resides on the host, it has an excellent view of what is happening in that host's software,
                    but is highly susceptible to attack. On the other hand, if the IDS resides in the network , it is
                    more resistant to attack, but has a poor view of what is happening inside the host, making it more
                    susceptible to evasion. In this paper we present an architecture that retains the visibility of a
                    host-based IDS, but pulls the IDS outside of the host for greater attack resistance. We achieve this
                    through the use of a virtual machine monitor. Using this approach allows us to isolate the IDS from
                    the monitored host but still retain excellent visibility into the host's state. The VMM also offers
                    us the unique ability to completely mediate interactions between the host software and the
                    underlying hardware. We present a detailed study of our architecture, including Livewire, a
                    prototype implementation. We demonstrate Livewire by implementing a suite of simple intrusion
                    detection policies and using them to detect real attacks.
