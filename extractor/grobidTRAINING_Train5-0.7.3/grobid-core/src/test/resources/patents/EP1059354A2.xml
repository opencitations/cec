  <p> FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p>
  <p>[0001] The present invention relates to isolated polynucleotides that represent a complete
   gene, or a fragment thereof, that is expressed. In addition, the present invention relates to the
   polypeptide or protein corresponding to the coding sequence of these polynucleotides. The present
   invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides that represent regulatory regions of genes.
   The present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides that represent untranslated
   regions of genes. The present invention further relates to the use of these isolated
   polynucleotides and polypeptides and proteins. </p>
  <p> DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </p>
  <p>[0002] Efforts to map and sequence the genome of a number of organisms are in progress; a few
   complete genome sequences, for example those of E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are known
   (<ref type="npl">Blattner et al., Science 277:1453 (1997)</ref>; <ref type="npl">Goffeau et al., Science 274:546 (1996)</ref>). The complete
   genome of a multicellular organism, C. elegans, has also been sequenced (See, the <ref type="npl">C. elegans
   Sequencing Consortium, Science 282:2012 (1998)</ref>). To date, no complete genome of a plant has been
   sequenced, nor has a complete cDNA complement of any plant been sequenced. </p>
  <p> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
  <p>[0003] The present invention comprises polynucleotides, such as complete cDNA sequences and/or
   sequences of genomic DNA encompassing complete genes, fragments of genes, and/or regulatory
   elements of genes and/or regions with other functions and/or intergenic regions, hereinafter
   collectively referred to as Sequence-Determined DNA Fragments (SDFs), from different plant
   species, particularly corn, wheat, soybean, rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, and other plants and
   or mutants, variants, fragments or fusions of said SDFs and polypeptides or proteins derived
   therefrom. In some instances, the SDFs span the entirety of a protein-coding segment. In some
   instances, the entirety of an mRNA is represented. Other objects of the invention that are also
   represented by SDFs of the invention are control sequences, such as, but not limited to,
   promoters. Complements of any sequence of the invention are also considered part of the
   invention. </p>
  <p>[0004] Other objects of the invention are polynucleotides comprising exon sequences,
   polynucleotides comprising intron sequences, polynucleotides comprising introns together with
   exons, intron/exon junction sequences, 5' untranslated sequences, and 3' untranslated sequences
   of the SDFs of the present invention. Polynucleotides representing the joinder of any exons
   described herein, in any arrangement, for example, to produce a sequence encoding any desirable
   amino acid sequence are within the scope of the invention. </p>
  <p>[0005] The present invention also resides in probes useful for isolating and identifying
   nucleic acids that hybridize to an SDF of the invention. The probes can be of any length, but
   more typically are 12-2000 nucleotides in length; more typically, 15 to 200 nucleotides long;
   even more typically, 18 to 100 nucleotides long. </p>
  <p>[0006] Yet another object of the invention is a method of isolating and/or identifying nucleic
   acids using the following steps: (a) contacting a probe of the instant invention with a
   polynucleotide sample under conditions that permit hybridization and formation of a
   polynucleotide duplex; and (b) detecting and/or isolating the duplex of step (a). </p>
  <p>[0007] The conditions for hybridization can be from low to moderate to high stringency
   conditions. The sample can include a polynucleotide having a sequence unique in a plant genome.
   Probes and methods of the invention are useful, for example, without limitation, for mapping of
   genetic traits and/or for positional cloning of a desired fragment of genomic DNA. </p>
  <p>[0008] Probes and methods of the invention can also be used for detecting alternatively spliced
   messages within a species. Probes and methods of the invention can further be used to detect or
   isolate related genes in other plant species using genomic DNA (gDNA) and/or cDNA libraries. In
   some instances, especially when longer probes and low to moderate stringency hybridization
   conditions are used; the probe will hybridize to a plurality of cDNA and/or gDNA sequences of a
   plant. This approach is useful for isolating representatives of gene families which are
   identifiable by possession of a common functional domain in the gene product or which have common
   cis-acting regulatory sequences. This approach is also useful for identifying orthologous genes
   from other organisms. </p>
  <p>[0009] The present invention also resides in constructs for modulating the expression of the
   genes comprised of all or a fragment of an SDF. The constructs comprise all or a fragment of the
   expressed SDF, or of a complementary sequence. Examples of constructs include ribozymes
   comprising RNA encoded by an SDF or by a sequence complementary thereto, antisense constructs,
   constructs comprising coding regions or parts thereof, constructs comprising promoters, introns,
   untranslated regions, scaffold attachment regions, methylating regions, enhancing or reducing
   regions, DNA and chromatin conformation modifying sequences, etc. Such constructs can be
   constructed using viral, plasmid, bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), plasmid artificial
   chromosomes (PACs), autonomous plant plasmids, plant artificial chromosomes or other types of
   vectors and exist in the plant as autonomous replicating sequences or as DNA integrated into the
   genome. When inserted into a host cell the construct is, preferably, functionally integrated
   with, or operatively linked to, a heterologous polynucleotide. For instance, a coding region from
   an SDF might be operably linked to a promoter that is functional in a plant. </p>
  <p>[0010] The present invention also resides in host cells, including bacterial or yeast cells or
   plant cells, and plants that harbor constructs such as described above. Another aspect of the
   invention relates to methods for modulating expression of specific genes in plants by expression
   of the coding sequence of the constructs, by regulation of expression of one or more endogenous
   genes in a plant or by suppression of expression of the polynucleotides of the invention in a
   plant. Methods of modulation of gene expression include without limitation (1) inserting into a
   host cell additional copies of a polynucleotide comprising a coding sequence; (2) modulating an
   endogenous promoter in a host cell; (3) inserting antisense or ribozyme constructs into a host
   cell and (4) inserting into a host cell a polynucleotide comprising a sequence encoding a variant
   fragment, or fusion of the native polypeptides of the instant invention. </p>
  <p> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE TABLES </p>
  <p>[0011] In TABLE 1, the format of the data is as follows: </p>
  <p>[0012] In Table 1, sequence data are presented in the form of annotation of a reference
   sequence. The format is shown below. The reference sequence is shown at the top of the annotation
   file as a 7 digit sequence number preceded by &quot;&gt;&quot; (e.g. &gt;5019261). The sequence
   identifier is a &quot;gi&quot; number that identifies a specific DNA sequence in the publically
   accessible BLAST Databases on the NCBI FTP web site (accessible at ncbi.nlm.gov/blast). In
   particular, the &quot;nt.Z&quot; nucleotide sequence data base at the NCBI FTP site utilizes the
   &quot;gi&quot; identifiers to assign by NCBI a unique identifier for each sequence in the
   databases, thereby providing a non-redundant database for sequences from various data bases,
   including GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ (DNA Database of Japan) and PDB (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank).
   Thus, the line in TABLE 1 beginning with sequence number identifies the unique &quot;gi&quot;
   identifier followed by the corresponding GenBank (gb) accession number and locus. The reference
   sequence number is followed on the next line by data regarding the length of the sequence
   (&quot;len&quot;) and the number of exons found in the sequence by the analysis program
   (&quot;nex&quot;). The annotation data are presented in columns; the leftmost column identifies
   the position of the putative exon in the gene as initial (&quot;init&quot;), internal
   (&quot;intr&quot;) or terminal (&quot;term&quot;). Genes considered composed of a single exon are
   denoted &quot;sngl&quot;. The next column describes the position in the nucleotide sequence
   beginning the exon (&quot;start&quot;) and the next column describes the position in the
   nucleotide sequence ending the exon (&quot;stop&quot;). The direction of the gene is indicated in
   the next column, &quot;+&quot; indicating 5' - 3' in the direction presented in the database,
   &quot;-&quot; indicating the opposite orientation. The &quot;gene number&quot; is given in the
   final column. Exons having the same gene number are grouped in the order shown to create the
   relevant coding sequence. EMI5.1 EMI6.1 </p>

  <p>[0017] The invention still further relates to V Transformation Techniques </p>
  <p> Definitions </p>
  <p> Allelic variant </p>
  <p>[0018] An &quot;allelic variant&quot; is an alternative form of the same SDF, which resides at
   the same chromosomal locus in the organism. Allelic variations can occur in any portion of the
   gene sequence, including regulatory regions. Allelic variants can arise by normal genetic
   variation in a population. Allelic variants can also be produced by genetic engineering methods.
   An allelic variant can be one that is found in a naturally occurring plant, including a cultivar
   or ecotype. An allelic variant may or may not give rise to a phenotypic change, and may or may
   not be expressed. An allele can result in a detectable change in the phenotype of the trait
   represented by the locus. A phenotypically silent allele can give rise to a product. </p>
  <p> Alternatively spliced messages </p>
  <p>[0019] Within the context of the current invention, &quot;alternatively spliced messages&quot;
   refers to mature mRNAs originating from a single gene with variations in the number and/or
   identity of exons, introns and/or intron-exon junctions. </p>
  <p> Chimeric </p>
  <p>[0020] The term &quot;chimeric&quot; is used to describe genes, as defined supra, or contructs
   wherein at least two of the elements of the gene or construct, such as the promoter and the
   coding sequence and/or other regulatory sequences and/or filler sequences and/or complements
   thereof, are heterologous to each other. </p>
  <p> Constitutive Promoter: </p>
  <p>[0021] Promoters referred to herein as &quot;constitutive promoters&quot; actively promote
   transcription under most, but not necessarily all, environmental conditions and states of
   development or cell differentiation. Examples of constitutive promoters include the cauliflower
   mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S transcript initiation region and the 1' or 2' promoter derived from T-DNA
   of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and other transcription initiation regions from various plant
   genes, such as the maize ubiquitin-1 promoter, known to those of skill. </p>
  <p> Coordinately Expressed: </p>
  <p>[0022] The term &quot;coordinately expressed,&quot; as used in the current invention, refers to
   genes that are expressed at the same or a similar time and/or stage and/or under the same or
   similar environmental conditions. </p>
  <p> Domain: </p>
  <p>[0023] Domains are fingerprints or signatures that can be used to characterize protein families
   and/or parts of proteins. Such fingerprints or signatures can comprise conserved (1) primary
   sequence, (2) secondary structure, and/or (3) three-dimensional conformation. Generally, each
   domain has been associated with either a family of proteins or motifs. Typically, these families
   and/or motifs have been correlated with specific in-vitro and/or in-vivo activities. A domain can
   be any length, including the entirety of the sequence of a protein. Detailed descriptions of the
   domains, associated families and motifs, and correlated activities of the polypeptides of the
   instant invention are described below. Usually, the polypeptides with designated domain(s) can
   exhibit at least one activity that is exhibited by any polypeptide that comprises the same
   domain(s). </p>
  <p> Endogenous </p>
  <p>[0024] The term &quot;endogenous,&quot; within the context of the current invention refers to
   any polynucleotide, polypeptide or protein sequence which is a natural part of a cell or
   organisms regenerated from said cell. </p>
  <p> Exogenous </p>
  <p>[0025] &quot;Exogenous,&quot; as referred to within, is any polynucleotide, polypeptide or
   protein sequence, whether chimeric or not, that is initially or subsequently introduced into the
   genome of an individual host cell or the organism regenerated from said host cell by any means
   other than by a sexual cross. Examples of means by which this can be accomplished are described
   below, and include Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (of dicots- e.g. <ref type="npl">Salomon et al. EMBO J.
   3:141 (1984)</ref>; <ref type="npl">Herrera-Estrella et al. EMBO J. 2:987 (1983)</ref>; of monocots, representative papers
   are those by <ref type="npl">Escudero et al., Plant J. 10:355 (1996)</ref>, <ref type="npl">Ishida et al., Nature Biotechnology 14:745
   (1996)</ref>, <ref type="npl">May et al., Bio/Technology 13 :486 (1995)</ref>), biolistic methods (<ref type="npl">Armaleo et al., Current
   Genetics 17:97 1990</ref>)), electroporation, in planta techniques, and the like. Such a plant
   containing the exogenous nucleic acid is referred to here as a T0 for the primary transgenic
   plant and T1 for the first generation. The term &quot;exogenous&quot; as used herein is also
   intended to encompass inserting a naturally found element into a non-naturally found location. </p>
  <p> Filler sequence: </p>
  <p>[0026] As used herein, &quot;filler sequence&quot; refers to any nucleotide sequence that is
   inserted into DNA construct to evoke a particular spacing between particular components such as a
   promoter and a coding region and may provide an additional attribute such as a restriction enzyme
   site. </p>
  <p> Gene: </p>
  <p>[0027] The term &quot;gene,&quot; as used in the context of the current invention, encompasses
   all regulatory and coding sequence contiguously associated with a single hereditary unit with a
   genetic function (see SCHEMATIC 1). Genes can include non-coding sequences that modulate the
   genetic function that include, but are not limited to, those that specify polyadenylation,
   transcriptional regulation, DNA conformation, chromatin conformation, extent and position of base
   methylation and binding sites of proteins that control all of these. Genes comprised of
   &quot;exons&quot; (coding sequences), which may be interrupted by &quot;introns&quot; (non-coding
   sequences), encode proteins. A gene's genetic function may require only RNA expression or protein
   production, or may only require binding of proteins and/or nucleic acids without associated
   expression. In certain cases, genes adjacent to one another may share sequence in such a way that
   one gene will overlap the other. A gene can be found within the genome of an organism, artificial
   chromosome, plasmid, vector, etc., or as a separate isolated entity. </p>
  <p> Gene Family: </p>
  <p>[0028] &quot;Gene family&quot; is used in the current invention to describe a group of
   functionally related genes, each of which encodes a separate protein. </p>
  <p> Heterologous sequences: </p>
  <p>[0029] &quot;Heterologous sequences&quot; are those that are not operatively linked or are not
   contiguous to each other in nature. For example, a promoter from corn is considered heterologous
   to an Arabidopsis coding region sequence. Also, a promoter from a gene encoding a growth factor
   from corn is considered heterologous to a sequence encoding the corn receptor for the growth
   factor. Regulatory element sequences, such as UTRs or 3' end termination sequences that do not
   originate in nature from the same gene as the coding sequence originates from, are considered
   heterologous to said coding sequence. Elements operatively linked in nature and contiguous to
   each other are not heterologous to each other. On the other hand, these same elements remain
   operatively linked but become heterologous if other filler sequence is placed between them. Thus,
   the promoter and coding sequences of a corn gene expressing an amino acid transporter are not
   heterologous to each other, but the promoter and coding sequence of a corn gene operatively
   linked in a novel manner are heterologous. </p>
  <p> Homologous gene </p>
  <p>[0030] In the current invention, &quot;homologous gene&quot; refers to a gene that shares
   sequence similarity with the gene of interest. This similarity may be in only a fragment of the
   sequence and often represents a functional domain such as, examples including without limitation
   a DNA binding domain, a domain with tyrosine kinase activity, or the like. The functional
   activities of homologous genes are not necessarily the same. </p>
  <p> Inducible Promoter </p>
  <p>[0031] An &quot;inducible promoter&quot; in the context of the current invention refers to a
   promoter which is regulated under certain conditions, such as light, chemical concentration,
   protein concentration, conditions in an organism, cell, or organelle, etc. A typical example of
   an inducible promoter, which can be utilized with the polynucleotides of the present invention,
   is PARSK1, the promoter from the Arabidopsis gene encoding a serine-threonine kinase enzyme, and
   which promoter is induced by dehydration, abscissic acid and sodium chloride (<ref type="npl">Wang and Goodman,
   Plant J. 8:37 (1995)</ref>) Examples of environmental conditions that may affect transcription by
   inducible promoters include anaerobic conditions, elevated temperature, or the presence of light. </p>
  <p> Intergenic region </p>
  <p>[0032] &quot;Intergenic region,&quot; as used in the current invention, refers to nucleotide
   sequence occurring in the genome that separates adjacent genes. </p>
  <p> Mutant gene </p>
  <p>[0033] In the current invention, &quot;mutant&quot; refers to a heritable change in DNA
   sequence at a specific location. Mutants of the current invention may or may not have an
   associated identifiable function when the mutant gene is transcribed. </p>
  <p> Orthologous Gene </p>
  <p>[0034] In the current invention &quot;orthologous gene&quot; refers to a second gene that
   encodes a gene product that performs a similar function as the product of a first gene. The
   orthologous gene may also have a degree of sequence similarity to the first gene. The orthologous
   gene may encode a polypeptide that exhibits a degree of sequence similarity to a polypeptide
   corresponding to a first gene. The sequence similarity can be found within a functional domain or
   along the entire length of the coding sequence of the genes and/or their corresponding
   polypeptides. </p>
  <p> Percentage of sequence identity </p>
  <p>[0035] &quot;Percentage of sequence identity,&quot; as used herein, is determined by comparing
   two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, where the fragment of the
   polynucleotide or amino acid sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or
   deletions (e.g., gaps or overhangs) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not
   comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is
   calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or
   amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing
   the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and
   multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Optimal alignment of
   sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of <ref type="npl">Smith and Waterman
   Add. APL. Math. 2:482 (1981)</ref>, by the homology alignment algorithm of <ref type="npl">Needleman and Wunsch J. Mol.
   Biol. 48:443 (1970)</ref>, by the search for similarity method of <ref type="npl">Pearson and Lipman Proc. Natl. Acad.
   Sci. (USA) 85: 2444 (1988)</ref>, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT,
   BLAST, PASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group
   (GCG), 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by inspection. Given that two sequences have been
   identified for comparison, GAP and BESTFIT are preferably employed to determine their optimal
   alignment. Typically, the default values of 5.00 for gap weight and 0.30 for gap weight length
   are used. The term &quot;substantial sequence identity&quot; between polynucleotide or
   polypeptide sequences refers to polynucleotide or polypeptide comprising a sequence that has at
   least 80% sequence identity, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90% and most
   preferably at least 95%, even more preferably, at least 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity
   compared to a reference sequence using the programs. </p>
  <p> Plant Promoter </p>
  <p>[0036] A &quot;plant promoter&quot; is a promoter capable of initiating transcription in plant
   cells and can drive or facilitate transcription of a fragment of the SDF of the instant invention
   or a coding sequence of the SDF of the instant invention. Such promoters need not be of plant
   origin. For example, promoters derived from plant viruses, such as the CaMV35S promoter or from
   Agrobacterium tumefaciens such as the T-DNA promoters, can be plant promoters. A typical example
   of a plant promoter of plant origin is the maize ubiquitin-1 (ubi-1)promoter known to those of
   skill. </p>
  <p> Promoter: </p>
  <p>[0037] The term &quot;promoter,&quot; as used herein, refers to a region of sequence
   determinants located upstream from the start of transcription of a gene and which are involved in
   recognition and binding of RNA polymerase and other proteins to initiate and modulate
   transcription. A basal promoter is the minimal sequence necessary for assembly of a transcription
   complex required for transcription initiation. Basal promoters frequently include a &quot;TATA
   box&quot; element usually located between 15 and 35 nucleotides upstream from the site of
   initiation of transcription. Basal promoters also sometimes include a &quot;CCAAT box&quot;
   element (typically a sequence CCAAT) and/or a GGGCG sequence, usually located between 40 and 200
   nucleotides, preferably 60 to 120 nucleotides, upstream from the start site of transcription. </p>
  <p> Public sequence: </p>
  <p>[0038] The term &quot;public sequence ,&quot; as used in the context of the instant
   application, refers to any sequence that has been deposited in a publicly accessible database.
   This term encompasses both amino acid and nucleotide sequences. Such sequences are publicly
   accessible, for example, on the BLAST databases on the NCBI FTP web site (accessible at
   ncbi.nlm.gov/blast). The database at the NCBI GTP site utilizes &quot;gi&quot; numbers assigned
   by NCBI as a unique identifier for each sequence in the databases, thereby providing a
   non-redundant database for sequence from various databases, including GenBank, EMBL, DBBJ, (DNA
   Database of Japan) and PDB (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank). </p>
  <p> Regulatory Sequence </p>
  <p>[0039] The term &quot;regulatory sequence,&quot; as used in the current invention, refers to
   any nucleotide sequence that influences transcription or translation initiation and rate, and
   stability and/or mobility of the transcript or polypeptide product. Regulatory sequences include,
   but are not limited to, promoters, promoter control elements, protein binding sequences, 5' and
   3' UTRs, transcriptional start site, termination sequence, polyadenylation sequence, introns,
   certain sequences within a coding sequence, etc. </p>
  <p> Related Sequences: </p>
  <p>[0040] &quot;Related sequences&quot; refer to either a polypeptide or a nucleotide sequence
   that exhibits some degree of sequence similarity with a sequence described in Table 1. </p>
  <p> Scaffold Attachment Region (SAR) </p>
  <p>[0041] As used herein, &quot;scaffold attachment region&quot; is a DNA sequence that anchors
   chromatin to the nuclear matrix or scaffold to generate loop domains that can have either a
   transcriptionally active or inactive structure (<ref type="npl">Spiker and Thompson (1996) Plant Physiol. 110:
   15-21</ref>). </p>
  <p> Sequence-determined DNA fragments (SDFs) </p>
  <p>[0042] &quot;Sequence-determined DNA fragments&quot; as used in the current invention are
   isolated sequences of genes, fragments of genes, intergenic regions or contiguous DNA from plant
   genomic DNA or cDNA or RNA the sequence of which has been determined. </p>
  <p> Signal Peptide </p>
  <p>[0043] A &quot;signal peptide&quot; as used in the current invention is an amino acid sequence
   that targets the protein for secretion, for transport to an intracellular compartment or
   organelle or for incorporation into a membrane. Signal peptides are indicated in the tables and a
   more detailed description located below. </p>
  <p> Specific Promoter </p>
  <p>[0044] In the context of the current invention, &quot;specific promoters&quot; refers to a
   subset of inducible promoters that have a high preference for being induced in a specific tissue
   or cell and/or at a specific time during development of an organism. By &quot;high
   preference&quot; is meant at least 3-fold, preferably 5-fold, more preferably at least 10-fold
   still more preferably at least 20-fold, 50-fold or 100-fold increase in transcription in the
   desired tissue over the transcription in any other tissue. Typical examples of temporal and/or
   tissue specific promoters of plant origin that can be used with the polynucleotides of the
   present invention, are: PTA29, a promoter which is capable of driving gene transcription
   specifically in tapetum and only during anther development (<ref type="npl">Koltonow et al., Plant Cell 2:1201
   (1990)</ref>; RCc2 and RCc3, promoters that direct root-specific gene transcription in rice (<ref type="npl">Xu et al.,
   Plant Mol. Biol. 27:237 (1995)</ref>; TobRB27, a root-specific promoter from tobacco (<ref type="npl">Yamamoto et al.,
   Plant Cell 3:371 (1991)</ref>). Examples of tissue-specific promoters under developmental control
   include promoters that initiate transcription only in certain tissues or organs, such as root,
   ovule, fruit, seeds, or flowers. Other suitable promoters include those from genes encoding
   storage proteins or the lipid body membrane protein, oleosin. A few root-specific promoters are
   noted above. </p>
  <p> Stringency </p>
  <p>[0045] &quot;Stringency&quot; as used herein is a function of probe length, probe composition
   (G + C content), and salt concentration, organic solvent concentration, and temperature of
   hybridization or wash conditions. Stringency is typically compared by the parameter Tm, which is
   the temperature at which 50% of the complementary molecules in the hybridization are hybridized,
   in terms of a temperature differential from Tm. High stringency conditions are those providing a
   condition of Tm - 5 DEG C to Tm - 10 DEG C. Medium or moderate stringency conditions are those
   providing Tm - 20 DEG C to Tm - 29 DEG C. Low stringency conditions are those providing a
   condition of Tm - 40 DEG C to Tm - 48 DEG C. The relationship of hybridization conditions to Tm
   (in DEG C) is expressed in the mathematical equation &quot;(1)&quot; Tm = 81.5 -
   16.6(log10[Na&lt;+&gt;]) + 0.41(%G+C) - (600/N) where N is the length of the probe. This equation
   works well for probes 14 to 70 nucleotides in length that are identical to the target sequence.
   The equation below for Tm of DNA-DNA hybrids is useful for probes in the range of 50 to greater
   than 500 nucleotides, and for conditions that include an organic solvent (formamide).
   &quot;(2)&quot; Tm = 81.5+16.6 log {[Na&lt;+&gt;]/(1+0.7[Na&lt;+&gt;])}+ 0.41(%G+C)-500/L
   0.63(%formamide) where L is the length of the probe in the hybrid. (<ref type="book">P. Tijessen,
   &quot;Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes&quot; in Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and
   Molecular Biology, P.C. vand der Vliet, ed., c. 1993 by Elsevier, Amsterdam</ref>.) The Tm of equation
   (2) is affected by the nature of the hybrid; for DNA-RNA hybrids Tm is 10-15 DEG C higher than
   calculated, for RNA-RNA hybrids Tm is 20-25 DEG C higher. Because the Tm decreases about 1 DEG C
   for each 1% decrease in homology when a long probe is used (<ref type="npl">Bonner et al., J. Mol. Biol. 81:123
   (1973)</ref>), stringency conditions can be adjusted to favor detection of identical genes or related
   family members. </p>
  <p>[0046] Equation (2) is derived assuming equilibrium and therefore, hybridizations according to
   the present invention are most preferably performed under conditions of probe excess and for
   sufficient time to achieve equilibrium. The time required to reach equilibrium can be shortened
   by inclusion of a hybridization accelerator such as dextran sulfate or another high volume
   polymer in the hybridization buffer. </p>
  <p>[0047] Stringency can be controlled during the hybridization reaction or after hybridization
   has occurred by altering the salt and temperature conditions of the wash solutions used. The
   formulas shown above are equally valid when used to compute the stringency of a wash solution.
   Preferred wash solution stringencies lie within the ranges stated above; high stringency is 5-8
   DEG C below Tm, medium or moderate stringency is 26-29 DEG C below Tm and low stringency is 45-48
   DEG C below Tm. </p>
  <p> Substantially free of </p>
  <p>[0048] A composition containing A is &quot;substantially free of&quot; B when at least 85% by
   weight of the total A+B in the composition is A. Preferably, A comprises at least about 90% by
   weight of the total of A+B in the composition, more preferably at least about 95% or even 99% by
   weight. For example, a plant gene or DNA sequence can be considered substantially free of other
   plant genes or DNA sequences. </p>
  <p> Translational start site </p>
  <p>[0049] In the context of the current invention, a &quot;translational start site&quot; is
   usually an ATG in the cDNA transcript, more usually the first ATG. A single cDNA, however, may
   have multiple translational start sites. </p>
  <p> Transcription start site </p>
  <p>[0050] &quot;Transcription start site&quot; is used in the current invention to describe the
   point at which transcription is initiated. This point is typically located about 25 nucleotides
   downstream from a TFIID binding site, such as a TATA box. Transcription can initiate at one or
   more sites within the gene, and a single gene may have multiple transcriptional start sites, some
   of which may be specific for transcription in a particular cell-type or tissue. </p>
  <p> Untranslated region (UTR) </p>
  <p>[0051] A &quot;UTR&quot; is any contiguous series of nucleotide bases that is transcribed, but
   is not translated. These untranslated regions may be associated with particular functions such as
   increasing mRNA message stability. Examples of UTRs include, but are not limited to
   polyadenylation signals, terminations sequences, sequences located between the transcriptional
   start site and the first exon (5' UTR) and sequences located between the last exon and the end of
   the mRNA (3' UTR). </p>
  <p> Variant: </p>
  <p>[0052] The term &quot;variant&quot; is used herein to denote a polypeptide or protein or
   polynucleotide molecule that differs from others of its kind in some way. For example,
   polypeptide and protein variants can consist of changes in amino acid sequence and/or charge
   and/or post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation, etc). </p>
  <p> DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
  <p> I. Polynucleotides </p>
  <p>[0053] Exemplified SDFs of the invention represent fragments of the genome of corn, wheat,
   rice, soybean or Arabidopsis and/or represent mRNA expressed from that genome. The isolated
   nucleic acid of the invention also encompasses corresponding fragments of the genome and/or cDNA
   complement of other organisms as described in detail below. </p>
  <p>[0054] Polynucleotides of the invention can be isolated from polynucleotide libraries using
   primers comprising sequence similar to those described by Table 1. See, for example, the methods
   described in Sambrook et al., supra. </p>
  <p>[0055] Alternatively, the polynucleotides of the invention can be produced by chemical
   synthesis. Such synthesis methods are described below. </p>
  <p>[0056] It is contemplated that the nucleotide sequences presented herein may contain some small
   percentage of errors. These errors may arise in the normal course of determination of nucleotide
   sequences. Sequence errors can be corrected by obtaining seeds deposited under the accession
   numbers cited herein, propagating them, isolating genomic DNA or appropriate mRNA from the
   resulting plants or seeds thereof, amplifying the relevant fragment of the genomic DNA or mRNA
   using primers having a sequence that flanks the erroneous sequence, and sequencing the
   amplification product. </p>
  <p> I.A. Probes, Primers and Substrates </p>
  <p>[0057] SDFs of the invention can be applied to substrates for use in array applications such
   as, but not limited to, assays of global gene expression, for example under varying conditions of
   development, growth conditions. The arrays can also be used in diagnostic or forensic methods
    (<ref type="pl">WO95/35505</ref>, <ref type="pl">US 5,445,943</ref> and <ref type="pl">US
    5,410,270</ref>). </p>
  <p>[0058] Probes and primers of the instant invention will hybridize to a polynucleotide
   comprising a sequence in Table 1. Though many different nucleotide sequences can encode an amino
   acid sequence, the sequences of Table 1 are generally preferred for encoding polypeptides of the
   invention. However, the sequence of the probes and/or primers of the instant invention need not
   be identical to those in Table 1 or the complements thereof. For example, some variation in probe
   or primer sequence and/or length can allow additional family members to be detected, as well as
   orthologous genes and more taxonomically distant related sequences. Similarly, probes and/or
   primers of the invention can include additional nucleotides that serve as a label for detecting
   the formed duplex or for subsequent cloning purposes. </p>
  <p>[0059] Probe length will vary depending on the application. For use as primers, probes are
   12-40 nucleotides, preferably 18-30 nucleotides long. For use in mapping, probes are preferably
   50 to 500 nucleotides, preferably 100-250 nucleotides long. For Southern hybridizations, probes
   as long as several kilobases can be used as explained below. </p>
  <p>[0060] The probes and/or primers can be produced by synthetic procedures such as the triester
   method of <ref type="npl">Matteucci et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103:3185( 1981)</ref>; or according to <ref type="npl">Urdea et al. Proc.
   Natl. Acad. 80:7461 (1981)</ref> or using commercially available automated oligonucleotide
   synthesizers. </p>
  <p> I.B. Methods of Detection and Isolation </p>
  <p>[0061] The polynucleotides of the invention can be utilized in a number of methods known to
   those skilled in the art as probes and/or primers to isolate and detect polynucleotides,
   including, without limitation: Southerns, Northerns, Branched DNA hybridization assays,
   polymerase chain reaction, and microarray assays, and variations thereof. Specific methods given
   by way of examples, and discussed below include: Hybridization Methods of Mapping Southern
   Blotting Isolating cDNA from Related Organisms Isolating and/or Identifying Orthologous Genes.
   Also, the nucleic acid molecules of the invention can used in other methods, such as high density
   oligonucleotide hybridizing assays, described, for example, in <ref type="pl">U.S. Pat. Nos.

  <p> B.1. Hybridization </p>
  <p>[0062] The isolated SDFs of Table 1 of the present invention can be used as probes and/or
   primers for detection and/or isolation of related polynucleotide sequences through hybridization.
   Hybridization of one nucleic acid to another constitutes a physical property that defines the
   subject SDF of the invention and the identified related sequences. Also, such hybridization
   imposes structural limitations on the pair. A good general discussion of the factors for
   determining hybridization conditions is provided by Sambrook et al. (&quot;<ref type="book">Molecular Cloning, a
   Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., c. 1989 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor,
   NY</ref>; see esp., chapters 11 and 12). Additional considerations and details of the physical
   chemistry of hybridization are provided by <ref type="book">G.H. Keller and M.M. Manak &quot;DNA Probes&quot;,
   2&lt;nd&gt; Ed. pp. 1-25, c. 1993 by Stockton Press, New York, NY</ref>. </p>
  <p>[0063] Depending on the stringency of the conditions under which these probes and/or primers
   are used, polynucleotides exhibiting a wide range of similarity to those in Table 1 can be
   detected or isolated. When the practitioner wishes to examine the result of membrane
   hybridizations under a variety of stringencies, an efficient way to do so is to perform the
   hybridization under a low stringency condition, then to wash the hybridization membrane under
   increasingly stringent conditions. </p>
  <p>[0064] When using SDFs to identify orthologous genes in other species, the practitioner will
   preferably adjust the amount of target DNA of each species so that, as nearly as is practical,
   the same number of genome equivalents are present for each species examined. This prevents faint
   signals from species having large genomes, and thus small numbers of genome equivalents per mass
   of DNA, from erroneously being interpreted as absence of the corresponding gene in the genome. </p>
  <p>[0065] The probes and/or primers of the instant invention can also be used to detect or isolate
   nucleotides that are &quot;identical&quot; to the probes or primers. Two nucleic acid sequences
   or polypeptides are said to be &quot;identical&quot; if the sequence of nucleotides or amino acid
   residues, respectively, in the two sequences is the same when aligned for maximum correspondence
   as described below. </p>
  <p>[0066] Isolated polynucleotides within the scope of the invention also include allelic variants
   of the specific sequences presented in Table 1. The probes and/or primers of the invention can
   also be used to detect and/or isolate polynucleotides exhibiting at least 80% sequence identity
   with the sequences of Table 1 or fragments thereof. </p>
  <p>[0067] With respect to nucleotide sequences, degeneracy of the genetic code provides the
   possibility to substitute at least one base of the base sequence of a gene with a different base
   without causing the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide produced from the gene to be changed.
   Hence, the DNA of the present invention may also have any base sequence that has been changed
   from a sequence in Table 1 by substitution in accordance with degeneracy of genetic code.

   et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 21(23): 5294 (1993)</ref>. </p>
  <p> B.2. Mapping </p>
  <p>[0068] The isolated SDF DNA of the invention can be used to create various types of genetic and
   physical maps of the genome of corn, Arabidopsis, soybean, rice, wheat, or other plants. Some
   SDFs may be absolutely associated with particular phenotypic traits, allowing construction of
   gross genetic maps. While not all SDFs will immediately be associated with a phenotype, all SDFs
   can be used as probes for identifying polymorphisms associated with phenotypes of interest.
   Briefly, one method of mapping involves total DNA isolation from individuals. It is subsequently
   cleaved with one or more restriction enzymes, separated according to mass, transferred to a solid
   support, hybridized with SDF DNA and the pattern of fragments compared. Polymorphisms associated
   with a particular SDF are visualized as differences in the size of fragments produced between
   individual DNA samples after digestion with a particular restriction enzyme and hybridization
   with the SDF. After identification of polymorphic SDF sequences, linkage studies can be
   conducted. By using the individuals showing polymorphisms as parents in crossing programs, F2
   progeny recombinants or recombinant inbreds, for example, are then analyzed. The order of DNA
   polymorphisms along the chromosomes can be determined based on the frequency with which they are
   inherited together versus independently. The closer two polymorphisms are together in a
   chromosome the higher the probability that they are inherited together. Integration of the
   relative positions of all the polymorphisms and associated marker SDFs can produce a genetic map
   of the species, where the distances between markers reflect the recombination frequencies in that
   chromosome segment. </p>
  <p>[0069] The use of recombinant inbred lines for such genetic mapping is described for
   Arabidopsis by <ref type="book">Alonso-Blanco et al. (Methods in Molecular Biology, vol.82, &quot;Arabidopsis
   Protocols&quot;, pp. 137-146, J.M. Martinez-Zapater and J. Salinas, eds., c. 1998 by Humana
   Press, Totowa, NJ</ref>) and for corn by <ref type="book">Burr (&quot;Mapping Genes with Recombinant Inbreds&quot;, pp.
   249-254. In Freeling, M. and V. Walbot (Ed.), The Maize Handbook, c. 1994 by Springer-Verlag New
   York, Inc.: New York, NY, USA</ref>; Berlin Germany; <ref type="npl">Burr et al. Genetics (1998) 118: 519</ref>; <ref type="npl">Gardiner, J.
   et al., (1993) Genetics 134: 917</ref>). This procedure, however, is not limited to plants and can be
   used for other organisms (such as yeast) or for individual cells. </p>
  <p>[0070] The SDFs of the present invention can also be used for simple sequence repeat (SSR)
   mapping. Rice SSR mapping is described by <ref type="npl">Morgante et al. (The Plant Journal (1993) 3: 165)</ref>,
   <ref type="npl">Panaud et al. (Genome (1995) 38: 1170)</ref>; <ref type="npl">Senior et al. (Crop Science (1996) 36: 1676)</ref>, <ref type="npl">Taramino et
   al. (Genome (1996) 39: 277)</ref> and <ref type="npl">Ahn et al. (Molecular and General Genetics (1993) 241: 483-90)</ref>.
   SSR mapping can be achieved using various methods. In one instance, polymorphisms are identified
   when sequence specific probes contained within an SDF flanking an SSR are made and used in
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with template DNA from two or more individuals of
   interest. Here, a change in the number of tandem repeats between the SSR-flanking sequences
   produces differently sized fragments (<ref type="pl">U.S. Patent 5,766,847</ref>). Alternatively,
   polymorphisms can be identified by using the PCR fragment produced from the SSR-flanking sequence
   specific primer reaction as a probe against Southern blots representing different individuals
   (<ref type="npl">U.H. Refseth et al., (1997) Electrophoresis 18: 1519</ref>). </p>
  <p>[0071] Genetic and physical maps of crop species have many uses. For example, these maps can be
   used to devise positional cloning strategies for isolating novel genes from the mapped crop
   species. In addition, because the genomes of closely related species are largely syntenic (that
   is, they display the same ordering of genes within the genome), these maps can be used to isolate
   novel alleles from relatives of crop species by positional cloning strategies. </p>
  <p>[0072] The various types of maps discussed above can be used with the SDFs of the invention to
   identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs). Many important crop traits, such as the solids content
   of tomatoes, are quantitative traits and result from the combined interactions of several genes.
   These genes reside at different loci in the genome, oftentimes on different chromosomes, and
   generally exhibit multiple alleles at each locus. The SDFs of the invention can be used to
   identify QTLs and isolate specific alleles as described by <ref type="npl">de Vicente and Tanksley (Genetics
   134:585 (1993))</ref>. In addition to isolating QTL alleles in present crop species, the SDFs of the
   invention can also be used to isolate alleles from the corresponding QTL of wild relatives.
   Transgenic plants having various combinations of QTL alleles can then be created and the effects
   of the combinations measured. Once a desired allele combination has been identified, crop
   improvement can be accomplished either through biotechnological means or by directed conventional
   breeding programs (for review see <ref type="npl">Tanksley and McCouch, Science 277:1063 (1997)</ref>). </p>
  <p>[0073] In another embodiment, the SDFs can be used to help create physical maps of the genome
   of corn, Arabidopsis and related species. Where SDFs have been ordered on a genetic map, as
   described above, they can be used as probes to discover which clones in large libraries of plant
   DNA fragments in YACs, BACs, etc. contain the same SDF or similar sequences, thereby facilitating
   the assignment of the large DNA fragments to chromosomal positions. Subsequently, the large BACs,
   YACs, etc. can be ordered unambiguously by more detailed studies of their sequence composition
   (e.g. <ref type="npl">Marra et al. (1997) Genomic Research 7:1072-1084</ref>) and by using their end or other sequences
   to find the identical sequences in other cloned DNA fragments. The overlapping of DNA sequences
   in this way allows large contigs of plant sequences to be built that, when sufficiently extended,
   provide a complete physical map of a chromosome. Sometimes the SDFs themselves will provide the
   means of joining cloned sequences into a contig. </p>
  <p>[0074] The patent publication <ref type="pl">WO95/35505</ref> and <ref type="pl">U.S. Patents
    5,445,943</ref> and <ref type="pl">5,410,270</ref> describe scanning multiple alleles of a
   plurality of loci using hybridization to arrays of oligonucleotides. These techniques are useful
   for each of the types of mapping discussed above. </p>
  <p>[0075] Following the procedures described above and using a plurality of the SDFs of the
   present invention, any individual can be genotyped. These individual genotypes can be used for
   the identification of particular cultivars, varieties, lines, ecotypes and genetically modified
   plants or can serve as tools for subsequent genetic studies involving multiple phenotypic traits. </p>
  <p> B.3 Southern Blot Hybridization </p>
  <p>[0076] The sequences from Table 1 can be used as probes for various hybridization techniques.
   These techniques are useful for detecting target polynucleotides in a sample or for determining
   whether transgenic plants, seeds or host cells harbor a gene or sequence of interest and thus
   might be expected to exhibit a particular trait or phenotype. </p>
  <p>[0077] In addition, the SDFs from the invention can be used to isolate additional members of
   gene families from the same or different species and/or orthologous genes from the same or
   different species. This is accomplished by hybridizing an SDF to, for example, a Southern blot
   containing the appropriate genomic DNA or cDNA. Given the resulting hybridization data, one of
   ordinary skill in the art could distinguish and isolate the correct DNA fragments by size,
   restriction sites, sequence and stated hybridization conditions from a gel or from a library. </p>
  <p>[0078] Identification and isolation of orthologous genes from closely related species and
   alleles within a species is particularly desirable because of their potential for crop
   improvement. Many important crop traits, such as the solid content of tomatoes, result from the
   combined interactions of the products of several genes residing at different loci in the genome.
   Generally, alleles at each of these loci can make quantitative differences to the trait. By
   identifying and isolating numerous alleles for each locus from within or different species,
   transgenic plants with various combinations of alleles can be created and the effects of the
   combinations measured. Once a more favorable allele combination has been identified, crop
   improvement can be accomplished either through biotechnological means or by directed conventional
   breeding programs (<ref type="npl">Tanksley et al. Science 277:1063(1997)</ref>). </p>
  <p>[0079] The results from hybridizations of the SDFs of the invention to, for example, Southern
   blots containing DNA from another species can also be used to generate restriction fragment maps
   for the corresponding genomic regions. These maps provide additional information about the
   relative positions of restriction sites within fragments, further distinguishing mapped DNA from
   the remainder of the genome. </p>
  <p>[0080] Physical maps can be made by digesting genomic DNA with different combinations of
   restriction enzymes. </p>
  <p>[0081] Probes for Southern blotting to distinguish individual restriction fragments can range
   in size from 15 to 20 nucleotides to several thousand nucleotides. More preferably, the probe is
   100 to 1,000 nucleotides long for identifying members of a gene family when it is found that
   repetitive sequences would complicate the hybridization. For identifying an entire corresponding
   gene in another species, the probe is more preferably the length of the gene, typically 2,000 to
   10,000 nucleotides, but probes 50-1,000 nucleotides long might be used. Some genes, however,
   might require probes up to 1,500 nucleotides long or overlapping probes constituting the
   full-length sequence to span their lengths. </p>
  <p>[0082] Also, while it is preferred that the probe be homogeneous with respect to its sequence,
   it is not necessary. For example, as described below, a probe representing members of a gene
   family having diverse sequences can be generated using PCR to amplify genomic DNA or RNA
   templates using primers derived from SDFs that include sequences that define the gene family. </p>
  <p>[0083] For identifying corresponding genes in another species, the next most preferable probe
   is a cDNA spanning the entire coding sequence, which allows all of the mRNA-coding fragment of
   the gene to be identified. Probes for Southern blotting can easily be generated from SDFs by
   making primers having the sequence at the ends of the SDF and using corn or Arabidopsis genomic
   DNA as a template. In instances where the SDF includes sequence conserved among species, primers
   including the conserved sequence can be used for PCR with genomic DNA from a species of interest
   to obtain a probe. Similarly, if the SDF includes a domain of interest, that fragment of the SDF
   can be used to make primers and, with appropriate template DNA, used to make a probe to identify
   genes containing the domain. Alternatively, the PCR products can be resolved, for example by gel
   electrophoresis, and cloned and/or sequenced. Using Southern hybridization, the variants of the
   domain among members of a gene family, both within and across species, can be examined. </p>
  <p> B.4.1 Isolating DNA from Related Organisms </p>
  <p>[0084] The SDFs of the invention can be used to isolate the corresponding DNA from other
   organisms. Either cDNA or genomic DNA can be isolated. For isolating genomic DNA, a lambda,
   cosmid, BAC or YAC, or other large insert genomic library from the plant of interest can be
   constructed using standard molecular biology techniques as described in detail by <ref type="book">Sambrook et al.
   1989 (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2&lt;nd&gt; ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
   Press, New York)</ref> and by <ref type="book">Ausubel et al. 1992 (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene
   Publishing, New York)</ref>. </p>
  <p>[0085] To screen a phage library, for example, recombinant lambda clones are plated out on
   appropriate bacterial medium using an appropriate E. coli host strain. The resulting plaques are
   lifted from the plates using nylon or nitrocellulose filters. The plaque lifts are processed
   through denaturation, neutralization, and washing treatments following the standard protocols
   outlined by Ausubel et al. (1992). The plaque lifts are hybridized to either radioactively
   labeled or non-radioactively labeled SDF DNA at room temperature for about 16 hours, usually in
   the presence of 50% formamide and 5X SSC (sodium chloride and sodium citrate) buffer and blocking
   reagents. The plaque lifts are then washed at 42 DEG C with 1% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) and
   at a particular concentration of SSC. The SSC concentration used is dependent upon the stringency
   at which hybridization occurred in the initial Southern blot analysis performed. For example, if
   a fragment hybridized under medium stringency (e.g., Tm - 20 DEG C), then this condition is
   maintained or preferably adjusted to a less stringent condition (e.g., Tm-30 DEG C) to wash the
   plaque lifts. Positive clones show detectable hybridization e.g., by exposure to X-ray films or
   chromogen formation. The positive clones are then subsequently isolated for purification using
   the same general protocol outlined above. Once the clone is purified, restriction analysis can be
   conducted to narrow the region corresponding to the gene of interest. The restriction analysis
   and succeeding subcloning steps can be done using procedures described by, for example Sambrook
   et al. (1989) cited above. </p>
  <p>[0086] The procedures outlined for the lambda library are essentially similar to those used for
   YAC library screening, except that the YAC clones are harbored in bacterial colonies. The YAC
   clones are plated out at reasonable density on nitrocellulose or nylon filters supported by
   appropriate bacterial medium in petri plates. Following the growth of the bacterial clones, the
   filters are processed through the denaturation, neutralization, and washing steps following the
   procedures of Ausubel et al. 1992. The same hybridization procedures for lambda library screening
   are followed. </p>
  <p>[0087] To isolate cDNA, similar procedures using appropriately modified vectors are employed.
   For instance, the library can be constructed in a lambda vector appropriate for cloning cDNA such
   as lambda gt11. Alternatively, the cDNA library can be made in a plasmid vector. cDNA for cloning
   can be prepared by any of the methods known in the art, but is preferably prepared as described
   above. Preferably, a cDNA library will include a high proportion of full-length clones. </p>
  <p> B. 5. Isolating and/or Identifying Orthologous Genes </p>
  <p>[0088] Probes and primers of the invention can be used to identify and/or isolate
   polynucleotides related to those in Table 1. Related polynucleotides are those that are native to
   other plant organisms and exhibit either similar sequence or encode polypeptides with similar
   biological activity. One specific example is an orthologous gene. Orthologous genes have the same
   functional activity. As such, orthologous genes may be distinguished from homologous genes. The
   percentage of identity is a function of evolutionary separation and, in closely related species,
   the percentage of identity can be 98 to 100%. The amino acid sequence of a protein encoded by an
   orthologous gene can be less than 75% identical, but tends to be at least75% or at least 80%
   identical, more preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 95% identical to the amino acid
   sequence of the reference protein. To find orthologous genes, the probes are hybridized to
   nucleic acids from a species of interest under low stringency conditions, preferably one where
   sequences containing as much as 40-45% mismatches will be able to hybridize. This condition is
   established by Tm - 40 DEG C to Tm - 48 DEG C (see below). Blots are then washed under conditions
   of increasing stringency. It is preferable that the wash stringency be such that sequences that
   are 85 to 100% identical will hybridize. More preferably, sequences 90 to 100% identical will
   hybridize and most preferably only sequences greater than 95% identical will hybridize. One of
   ordinary skill in the art will recognize that, due to degeneracy in the genetic code, amino acid
   sequences that are identical can be encoded by DNA sequences as little as 67% identical or less.
   Thus, it is preferable, for example, to make an overlapping series of shorter probes, on the
   order of 24 to 45 nucleotides, and individually hybridize them to the same arrayed library to
   avoid the problem of degeneracy introducing large numbers of mismatches. </p>
  <p>[0089] As evolutionary divergence increases, genome sequences also tend to diverge. Thus, one
   of skill will recognize that searches for orthologous genes between more divergent species will
   require the use of lower stringency conditions compared to searches between closely related
   species. Also, degeneracy of the genetic code is more of a problem for searches in the genome of
   a species more distant evolutionarily from the species that is the source of the SDF probe
   sequences. </p>
  <p>[0090] The SDFs of the invention can also be used as probes to search for genes that are
   related to the SDF within a species. Such related genes are typically considered to be members of
   a gene family. In such a case, the sequence similarity will often be concentrated into one or a
   few fragments of the sequence. The fragments of similar sequence that define the gene family
   typically encode a fragment of a protein or RNA that has an enzymatic or structural function. The
   percentage of identity in the amino acid sequence of the domain that defines the gene family is
   preferably at least 70%, more preferably 80 to 95%, most preferably 85 to 99%. To search for
   members of a gene family within a species, a low stringency hybridization is usually performed,
   but this will depend upon the size, distribution and degree of sequence divergence of domains
   that define the gene family. SDFs encompassing regulatory regions can be used to identify
   coordinately expressed genes by using the regulatory region sequence of the SDF as a probe. </p>
  <p>[0091] In the instances where the SDFs are identified as being expressed from genes that confer
   a particular phenotype, then the SDFs can also be used as probes to assay plants of different
   species for those phenotypes. </p>
  <p> I.C. Methods to Inhibit Gene Expression </p>
  <p>[0092] The nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can be used to inhibit gene
   transcription and/or translation. Example of such methods include, without limitation: Antisense
   Constructs; Ribozyme Constructs; Chimeraplast Constructs; Co-Suppression; Transcriptional
   Silencing; and Other Methods of Gene Expression. </p>
  <p> C.1 Antisense </p>
  <p>[0093] In some instances it is desirable to suppress expression of an endogenous or exogenous
   gene. A well-known instance is the FLAVOR-SAVOR TM tomato, in which the gene encoding ACC
   synthase is inactivated by an antisense approach, thus delaying softening of the fruit after
   ripening. See for example, <ref type="pl">U.S. Patent No. 5,859,330</ref>; <ref type="pl">U.S.
    Patent No. 5,723,766</ref>; <ref type="npl">Oeller, et al, Science, 254:437-439(1991)</ref>; and <ref type="npl">Hamilton et al,
   Nature, 346:284-287 (1990)</ref>. Also, timing of flowering can be controlled by suppression of the
   FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC); high levels of this transcript are associated with late flowering, while
   absence of FLC is associated with early flowering (<ref type="npl">S.D. Michaels et al., Plant Cell 11:949
   (1999)</ref>. Also, the transition of apical meristem from production of leaves with associated shoots
   to flowering is regulated by TERMINAL FLOWER1, APETALA1 and LEAFY. Thus, when it is desired to
   induce a transition from shoot production to flowering, it is desirable to suppress TFL1
   expression (<ref type="npl">S.J. Liljegren, Plant Cell 11:1007 (1999)</ref>). As another instance, arrested ovule
   development and female sterility result from suppression of the ethylene forming enzyme but can
   be reversed by application of ethylene (<ref type="npl">D. De Martinis et al., Plant Cell 11:1061 (1999)</ref>). The
   ability to manipulate female fertility of plants is useful in increasing fruit production and
   creating hybrids. </p>
  <p>[0094] In the case of polynucleotides used to inhibit expression of an endogenous gene, the
   introduced sequence need not be perfectly identical to a sequence of the target endogenous gene.
   The introduced polynucleotide sequence will typically be at least substantially identical to the
   target endogenous sequence. </p>
  <p>[0095] Some polynucleotide SDFs in Table 1 represent sequences that are expressed in
   corn,wheat, rice, soybean Arabidopsis and/or other plants. Thus the invention includes using
   these sequences to generate antisense constructs to inhibit translation and/or degradation of
   transcripts of said SDFs, typically in a plant cell. </p>
  <p>[0096] To accomplish this, a polynucleotide segment from the desired gene that can hybridize to
   the mRNA expressed from the desired gene (the &quot;antisense segment&quot;) is operably linked
   to a promoter such that the antisense strand of RNA will be transcribed when the construct is
   present in a host cell. A regulated promoter can be used in the construct to control
   transcription of the antisense segment so that transcription occurs only under desired
   circumstances. </p>
  <p>[0097] The antisense segment to be introduced generally will be substantially identical to at
   least a fragment of the endogenous gene or genes to be repressed. The sequence, however, need not
   be perfectly identical to inhibit expression. Further, the antisense product may hybridize to the
   untranslated region instead of or in addition to the coding sequence of the gene. The vectors of
   the present invention can be designed such that the inhibitory effect applies to other proteins
   within a family of genes exhibiting homology or substantial homology to the target gene. </p>
  <p>[0098] For antisense suppression, the introduced antisense segment sequence also need not be
   full length relative to either the primary transcription product or the fully processed mRNA.
   Generally, a higher percentage of sequence identity can be used to compensate for the use of a
   shorter sequence. Furthermore, the introduced sequence need not have the same intron or exon
   pattern, and homology of non-coding segments may be equally effective. Normally, a sequence of
   between about 30 or 40 nucleotides and the full length of the transcript canbe used, though a
   sequence of at least about 100 nucleotides is preferred, a sequence of at least about 200
   nucleotides is more preferred, and a sequence of at least about 500 nucleotides is especially
   preferred. </p>
  <p> C.2. Ribozymes </p>
  <p>[0099] It is also contemplated that gene constructs representing ribozymes and based on the
   SDFs in TABLE 1 are an object of the invention. Ribozymes can also be used to inhibit expression
   of genes by suppressing the translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide. It is possible to design
   ribozymes that specifically pair with virtually any target RNA and cleave the phosphodiester
   backbone at a specific location, thereby functionally inactivating the target RNA. In carrying
   out this cleavage, the ribozyme is not itself altered, and is thus capable of recycling and
   cleaving other molecules, making it a true enzyme. The inclusion of ribozyme sequences within
   antisense RNAs confers RNA-cleaving activity upon them, thereby increasing the activity of the
   constructs. </p>
  <p>[0100] A number of classes of ribozymes have been identified. One class of ribozymes is derived
   from a number of small circular RNAs, which are capable of self-cleavage and replication in
   plants. The RNAs replicate either alone (viroid RNAs) or with a helper virus (satellite RNAs).
   Examples include RNAs from avocado sunblotch viroid and the satellite RNAs from tobacco ringspot
   virus, lucerne transient streak virus, velvet tobacco mottle virus, solanum nodiflorum mottle
   virus and subterranean clover mottle virus. The design and use of target RNA-specific ribozymes
   is described in <ref type="npl">Haseloff et al. Nature, 334:585 (1988)</ref>. </p>
  <p>[0101] Like the antisense constructs above, the ribozyme sequence fragment necessary for
   pairing need not be identical to the target nucleotides to be cleaved, nor identical to the
   sequences in TABLE 1. Ribozymes may be constructed by combining the ribozyme sequence and some
   fragment of the target gene which would allow recognition of the target gene mRNA by the
   resulting ribozyme molecule. Generally, the sequence in the ribozyme capable of binding to the
   target sequence exhibits a percentage of sequence identity with at least 80%, preferably with at
   least 85%, more preferably with at least 90% and most preferably with at least 95%, even more
   preferably, with at least 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity to some fragment of a sequence
   in TABLE 1 or the complement thereof. The ribozyme can be equally effective in inhibiting mRNA
   translation by cleaving either in the untranslated or coding regions. Generally, a higher
   percentage of sequence identity can be used to compensate for the use of a shorter sequence.
   Furthermore, the introduced sequence need not have the same intron or exon pattern, and homology
   of non-coding segments may be equally effective. </p>
  <p> C.3. Chimeraplasts </p>
  <p>[0102] The SDFs of the invention, such as those described by Table 1, can also be used to
   construct chimeraplasts that can be introduced into a cell to produce at least one specific
   nucleotide change in a sequence corresponding to the SDF of the invention. A chimeraplast is an
   oligonucleotide comprising DNA and/or RNA that specifically hybridizes to a target region in a
   manner which creates a mismatched base-pair. This mismatched base-pair signals the cell's repair
   enzyme machinery which acts on the mismatched region resulting in the replacement, insertion or
   deletion of designated nucleotide(s). The altered sequence is then expressed by the cell's normal
   cellular mechanisms. Chimeraplasts can be designed to repair mutant genes, modify genes,
   introduce site-specific mutations, and/or act to interrupt or alter normal gene function (<ref
    type="pl">US Pat. Nos. 6,010,907</ref> and <ref type="pl">6,004,804</ref>; and PCT Pub. No. <ref
    type="pl">WO99/58723</ref> and <ref type="pl">WO99/07865</ref>). </p>
  <p> C.4. Sense Suppression </p>
  <p>[0103] The SDFs of Table 1 of the present invention are also useful to modulate gene expression
   by sense suppression. Sense suppression represents another method of gene suppression by
   introducing at least one exogenous copy or fragment of the endogenous sequence to be suppressed. </p>
  <p>[0104] Introduction of expression cassettes in which a nucleic acid is configured in the sense
   orientation with respect to the promoter into the chromosome of a plant or by a self-replicating
   virus has been shown to be an effective means by which to induce degradation of mRNAs of target
   genes. For an example of the use of this method to modulate expression of endogenous genes see,
   <ref type="npl">Napoli et al., The Plant Cell 2:279 (1990)</ref>, and <ref type="pl">U.S. Patents Nos. 5,034,323</ref>,
    <ref type="pl">5,231,020</ref>, and <ref type="pl">5,283,184</ref>. Inhibition of expression may
   require some transcription of the introduced sequence. </p>
  <p>[0105] For sense suppression, the introduced sequence generally will be substantially identical
   to the endogenous sequence intended to be inactivated. The minimal percentage of sequence
   identity will typically be greater than about 65%, but a higher percentage of sequence identity
   might exert a more effective reduction in the level of normal gene products. Sequence identity of
   more than about 80% is preferred, though about 95% to absolute identity would be most preferred.
   As with antisense regulation, the effect would likely apply to any other proteins within a
   similar family of genes exhibiting homology or substantial homology to the suppressing sequence. </p>
  <p> C.5. Transcriptional Silencing </p>
  <p>[0106] The nucleic acid sequences of the invention, including the SDFs of Table 1, and
   fragments thereof, contain sequences that can be inserted into the genome of an organism
   resulting in transcriptional silencing. Such regulatory sequences need not be operatively linked
   to coding sequences to modulate transcription of a gene. Specifically, a promoter sequence
   without any other element of a gene can be introduced into a genome to transcriptionally silence
   an endogenous gene (see, for example, <ref type="npl">Vaucheret, H et al. (1998) The Plant Journal 16: 651 -
   659</ref>). As another example, triple helices can be formed using oligonucleotides based on sequences
   from TABLE 1, fragments thereof, and substantially similar sequence thereto. The oligonucleotide
   can be delivered to the host cell and can bind to the promoter in the genome to form a triple
   helix and prevent transcription. An oligonucleotide of interest is one that can bind to the
   promoter and block binding of a transcription factor to the promoter. In such a case, the
   oligonucleotide can be complementary to the sequences of the promoter that interact with
   transcription binding factors. </p>
  <p> C.6. Other Methods to Inhibit Gene Expression </p>
  <p>[0107] Yet another means of suppressing gene expression is to insert a polynucleotide into the
   gene of interest to disrupt transcription or translation of the gene. </p>
  <p>[0108] Low frequency homologous recombination can be used to target a polynucleotide insert to
   a gene by flanking the polynucleotide insert with sequences that are substantially similar to the
   gene to be disrupted. Sequences from TABLE 1, fragments thereof, and substantially similar
   sequence thereto can be used for homologous recombination. </p>
  <p>[0109] In addition, random insertion of polynucleotides into a host cell genome can also be
   used to disrupt the gene of interest. <ref type="npl">Azpiroz-Leehan et al., Trends in Genetics 13:152 (1997)</ref>. In
   this method, screening for clones from a library containing random insertions is preferred to
   identifying those that have polynucleotides inserted into the gene of interest. Such screening
   can be performed using probes and/or primers described above based on sequences from TABLE 1,
   fragments thereof, and substantially similar sequence thereto. The screening can also be
   performed by selecting clones or R1 plants having a desired phenotype. </p>
  <p> I.D. Methods of Functional Analysis </p>
  <p>[0110] The constructs described in the methods under I.C. above can be used to determine the
   function of the polypeptide encoded by the gene that is targeted by the constructs. </p>
  <p>[0111] Down-regulating the transcription and translation of the targeted gene in the host cell
   or organisms, such as a plant, may produce phenotypic changes as compared to a wild-type cell or
   organism. In addition, in vitro assays can be used to determine if any biological activity, such
   as calcium flux, DNA transcription, nucleotide incorporation, etc., are being modulated by the
   down-regulation of the targeted gene. </p>
  <p>[0112] Coordinated regulation of sets of genes, e.g., those contributing to a desired polygenic
   trait, is sometimes necessary to obtain a desired phenotype. SDFs of the invention representing
   transcription activation and DNA binding domains can be assembled into hybrid transcriptional
   activators. These hybrid transcriptional activators can be used with their corresponding DNA
   elements (i.e., those bound by the DNA-binding SDFs) to effect coordinated expression of desired
   genes (<ref type="npl">J.J. Schwarz et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:266 (1992)</ref>, <ref type="npl">A. Martinez et al., Mol. Gen. Genet.
   261:546 (1999)</ref>). </p>
  <p>[0113] The SDFs of the invention can also be used in the two-hybrid genetic systems to identify
   networks of protein-protein interactions (<ref type="npl">L. McAlister-Henn et al., Methods 19:330 (1999)</ref>, <ref type="npl">J.C.
   Hu et al., Methods 20:80 (2000)</ref>, <ref type="npl">M. Golovkin et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:36428 (1999)</ref>, <ref type="npl">K. Ichimura
   et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 253:532 (1998)</ref>). The SDFs of the invention can also be used
   in various expression display methods to identify important protein-DNA interactions (e.g. <ref type="npl">B. Luo
   et al., J. Mol. Biol. 266:479 (1997)</ref>). </p>
  <p> I.E. Promoters </p>
  <p>[0114] The SDFs of the invention are also useful as structural or regulatory sequences in a
   construct for modulating the expression of the corresponding gene in a plant or other organism,
   e.g. a symbiotic bacterium. For example, promoter sequences associated to SDFs of Table 1 of the
   present invention can be useful in directing expression of coding sequences either as
   constitutive promoters or to direct expression in particular cell types, tissues, or organs or in
   response to environmental stimuli. </p>
  <p>[0115] With respect to the SDFs of the present invention a promoter is likely to be a
   relatively small portion of a genomic DNA (gDNA) sequence located in the first 2000 nucleotides
   upstream from an initial exon identified in a gDNA sequence or initial &quot;ATG&quot; or
   methionine codon or translational start site in a corresponding cDNA sequence. Such promoters are
   more likely to be found in the first 1000 nucleotides upstream of an initial ATG or methionine
   codon or translational start site of a cDNA sequence corresponding to a gDNA sequence. In
   particular, the promoter is usually located upstream of the transcription start site. The
   fragments of a particular gDNA sequence that function as elements of a promoter in a plant cell
   will preferably be found to hybridize to gDNA sequences presented and described in Table 1 at
   medium or high stringency, relevant to the length of the probe and its base composition. </p>
  <p>[0116] Promoters are generally modular in nature. Promoters can consist of a basal promoter
   that functions as a site for assembly of a transcription complex comprising an RNA polymerase,
   for example RNA polymerase II. A typical transcription complex will include additional factors
   such as TFIIB, TFIID, and TFIIE. Of these, TFIID appears to be the only one to bind DNA directly.
   The promoter might also contain one or more enhancers and/or suppressors that function as binding
   sites for additional transcription factors that have the function of modulating the level of
   transcription with respect to tissue specificity and of transcriptional responses to particular
   environmental or nutritional factors, and the like. </p>
  <p>[0117] Short DNA sequences representing binding sites for proteins can be separated from each
   other by intervening sequences of varying length. For example, within a particular functional
   module, protein binding sites may be constituted by regions of 5 to 60, preferably 10 to 30, more
   preferably 10 to 20 nucleotides. Within such binding sites, there are typically 2 to 6
   nucleotides that specifically contact amino acids of the nucleic acid binding protein. The
   protein binding sites are usually separated from each other by 10 to several hundred nucleotides,
   typically by 15 to 150 nucleotides, often by 20 to 50 nucleotides. DNA binding sites in promoter
   elements often display dyad symmetry in their sequence. Often elements binding several different
   proteins, and/or a plurality of sites that bind the same protein, will be combined in a region of
   50 to 1,000 basepairs. </p>
  <p>[0118] Elements that have transcription regulatory function can be isolated from their
   corresponding endogenous gene, or the desired sequence can be synthesized, and recombined in
   constructs to direct expression of a coding region of a gene in a desired tissue-specific,
   temporal-specific or other desired manner of inducibility or suppression. When hybridizations are
   performed to identify or isolate elements of a promoter by hybridization to the long sequences
   presented in TABLE 1, conditions are adjusted to account for the above-described nature of
   promoters. For example short probes, constituting the element sought, are preferably used under
   low temperature and/or high salt conditions. When long probes, which might include several
   promoter elements are used, low to medium stringency conditions are preferred when hybridizing to
   promoters across species. </p>
  <p>[0119] If a nucleotide sequence of an SDF, or part of the SDF, functions as a promoter or
   fragment of a promoter, then nucleotide substitutions, insertions or deletions that do not
   substantially affect the binding of relevant DNA binding proteins would be considered equivalent
   to the exemplified nucleotide sequence. It is envisioned that there are instances where it is
   desirable to decrease the binding of relevant DNA binding proteins to silence or down-regulate a
   promoter, or conversely to increase the binding of relevant DNA binding proteins to enhance or
   up-regulate a promoter and vice versa. In such instances, polynucleotides representing changes to
   the nucleotide sequence of the DNA-protein contact region by insertion of additional nucleotides,
   changes to identity of relevant nucleotides, including use of chemically-modified bases, or
   deletion of one or more nucleotides are considered encompassed by the present invention. In
   addition, fragments of the promoter sequences described by Table 1 and variants thereof can be
   fused with other promoters or fragments to facilitate transcription and/or transcription in
   specific type of cells or under specific conditions. </p>
  <p>[0120] Promoter function can be assayed by methods known in the art, preferably by measuring
   activity of a reporter gene operatively linked to the sequence being tested for promoter
   function. Examples of reporter genes include those encoding luciferase, green fluorescent
   protein, GUS, neo, cat and bar. </p>
  <p> I.F. UTRs and Junctions </p>
  <p>[0121] Polynucleotides comprising untranslated (UTR) sequences and intron/exon junctions are
   also within the scope of the invention. UTR sequences include introns and 5' or 3' untranslated
   regions ( 5' UTRs or 3' UTRs). Fragments of the sequences shown in TABLE 1 can comprise UTRs and
   intron/exon junctions. </p>
  <p>[0122] These fragments of SDFs, especially UTRs, can have regulatory functions related to, for
   example, translation rate and mRNA stability. Thus, these fragments of SDFs can be isolated for
   use as elements of gene constructs for regulated production of polynucleotides encoding desired
   polypeptides. </p>
  <p>[0123] Introns of genomic DNA segments might also have regulatory functions. Sometimes
   regulatory elements, especially transcription enhancer or suppressor elements, are found within
   introns. Also, elements related to stability of heteronuclear RNA and efficiency of splicing and
   of transport to the cytoplasm for translation can be found in intron elements. Thus, these
   segments can also find use as elements of expression vectors intended for use to transform
   plants. </p>
  <p>[0124] Just as with promoters UTR sequences and intron/exon junctions can vary from those shown
   in TABLE 1. Such changes from those sequences preferably will not affect the regulatory activity
   of the UTRs or intron/exon junction sequences on expression, transcription, or translation unless
   selected to do so. However, in some instances, down- or up-regulation of such activity may be
   desired to modulate traits or phenotypic or in vitro activity. </p>
  <p> I.G. Coding Sequences </p>
  <p>[0125] Isolated polynucleotides of the invention can include coding sequences that encode
   polypeptides comprising an amino acid sequence encoded by sequences in TABLE 1 or an amino acid
   sequence presented in TABLE 1. </p>
  <p>[0126] A nucleotide sequence encodes a polypeptide if a cell (or a cell free in vitro system)
   expressing that nucleotide sequence produces a polypeptide having the recited amino acid sequence
   when the nucleotide sequence is transcribed and the primary transcript is subsequently processed
   and translated by a host cell (or a cell free in vitro system) harboring the nucleic acid. Thus,
   an isolated nucleic acid that encodes a particular amino acid sequence can be a genomic sequence
   comprising exons and introns or a cDNA sequence that represents the product of splicing thereof.
   An isolated nucleic acid encoding an amino acid sequence also encompasses heteronuclear RNA,
   which contains sequences that are spliced out during expression, and mRNA, which lacks those
   sequences. </p>
  <p>[0127] Coding sequences can be constructed using chemical synthesis techniques or by isolating
   coding sequences or by modifying such synthesized or isolated coding sequences as described
   above. </p>
  <p>[0128] In addition to coding sequences encoding the polypeptide sequences of TABLE 1, which are
   native to corn, Arabidopsis, soybean, rice, wheat, and other plants the isolated polynucleotides
   can be polynucleotides that encode variants, fragments, and fusions of those native proteins.
   Such polypeptides are described below in part II. </p>
  <p>[0129] In variant polynucleotides generally, the number of substitutions, deletions or
   insertions is preferably less than 20%, more preferably less than 15%; even more preferably less
   than 10%, 5%, 3% or 1% of the number of nucleotides comprising a particularly exemplified
   sequence. It is generally expected that non-degenerate nucleotide sequence changes that result in
   1 to 10, more preferably 1 to 5 and most preferably 1 to 3 amino acid insertions, deletions or
   substitutions will not greatly affect the function of an encoded polypeptide. The most preferred
   embodiments are those wherein 1 to 20, preferably 1 to 10, most preferably 1 to 5 nucleotides are
   added to, deleted from and/or substituted in the sequences specifically disclosed in TABLE 1. </p>
  <p>[0130] Insertions or deletions in polynucleotides intended to be used for encoding a
   polypeptide preferably preserve the reading frame. This consideration is not so important in
   instances when the polynucleotide is intended to be used as a hybridization probe. </p>
  <p> II. Polypeptides and Proteins </p>
  <p> IIA. Native polypeptides and proteins </p>
  <p>[0131] Polypeptides within the scope of the invention include both native proteins as well as
   variants, fragments, and fusions thereof. Polypeptides of the invention are those encoded by any
   of the six reading frames of sequences shown in TABLE 1, preferably encoded by the three frames
   reading in the 5' to 3' direction of the sequences as shown. </p>
  <p>[0132] Native polypeptides include the proteins encoded by the sequences shown in TABLE 1. Such
   native polypeptides include those encoded by allelic variants. </p>
  <p>[0133] Polypeptide and protein variants will exhibit at least 75% sequence identity to those
   native polypeptides of TABLE 1. More preferably, the polypeptide variants will exhibit at least
   85% sequence identity; even more preferably, at least 90% sequence identity; more preferably at
   least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity. Fragments of polypeptide or fragments of
   polypeptides will exhibit similar percentages of sequence identity to the relevant fragments of
   the native polypeptide. Fusions will exhibit a similar percentage of sequence identity in that
   fragment of the fusion represented by the variant of the native peptide. </p>
  <p>[0134] Furthermore, polypeptide variants will exhibit at least one of the functional properties
   of the native protein. Such properties include, without limitation, protein interaction, DNA
   interaction, biological activity, immunological activity, receptor binding, signal transduction,
   transcription activity, growth factor activity, secondary structure, three-dimensional structure,
   etc. As to properties related to in vitro or in vivo activities, the variants preferably exhibit
   at least 60% of the activity of the native protein; more preferably at least 70%, even more
   preferably at least 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% of at least one activity of the native protein. </p>
  <p>[0135] One type of variant of native polypeptides comprises amino acid substitutions, deletions
   and/or insertions. Conservative substitutions are preferred to maintain the function or activity
   of the polypeptide. </p>
  <p>[0136] Within the scope of percentage of sequence identity described above, a polypeptide of
   the invention may have additional individual amino acids or amino acid sequences inserted into
   the polypeptide in the middle thereof and/or at the N-terminal and/or C-terminal ends thereof.
   Likewise, some of the amino acids or amino acid sequences may be deleted from the polypeptide. </p>
  <p> A.1 Antibodies </p>
  <p>[0137] Isolated polypeptides can be utilized to produce antibodies. Polypeptides of the
   invention can generally be used, for example, as antigens for raising antibodies by known
   techniques. The resulting antibodies are useful as reagents for determining the distribution of
   the antigen protein within the tissues of a plant or within a cell of a plant. The antibodies are
   also useful for examining the production level of proteins in various tissues, for example in a
   wild-type plant or following genetic manipulation of a plant, by methods such as Western
   blotting. </p>
  <p>[0138] Antibodies of the present invention, both polyclonal and monoclonal, may be prepared by
   conventional methods. In general, the polypeptides of the invention are first used to immunize a
   suitable animal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, or goat. Rabbits and goats are preferred for the
   preparation of polyclonal sera due to the volume of serum obtainable, and the availability of
   labeled anti-rabbit and anti-goat antibodies as detection reagents. Immunization is generally
   performed by mixing or emulsifying the protein in saline, preferably in an adjuvant such as
   Freund's complete adjuvant, and injecting the mixture or emulsion parenterally (generally
   subcutaneously or intramuscularly). A dose of 50-200 mu g/injection is typically sufficient.
   Immunization is generally boosted 2-6 weeks later with one or more injections of the protein in
   saline, preferably using Freund's incomplete adjuvant. One may alternatively generate antibodies
   by in vitro immunization using methods known in the art, which for the purposes of this invention
   is considered equivalent to in vivo immunization. </p>
  <p>[0139] Polyclonal antisera is obtained by bleeding the immunized animal into a glass or plastic
   container, incubating the blood at 25 DEG C for one hour, followed by incubating the blood at 4
   DEG C for 2-18 hours. The serum is recovered by centrifugation (e.g., 1,000xg for 10 minutes).
   About 20-50 ml per bleed may be obtained from rabbits. </p>
  <p>[0140] Monoclonal antibodies are prepared using the method of <ref type="npl">Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256:
   495 (1975)</ref>, or modification thereof. Typically, a mouse or rat is immunized as described above.
   However, rather than bleeding the animal to extract serum, the spleen (and optionally several
   large lymph nodes) is removed and dissociated into single cells. If desired, the spleen cells can
   be screened (after removal of nonspecifically adherent cells) by applying a cell suspension to a
   plate, or well, coated with the protein antigen. B-cells producing membrane-bound immunoglobulin
   specific for the antigen bind to the plate, and are not rinsed away with the rest of the
   suspension. Resulting B-cells, or all dissociated spleen cells, are then induced to fuse with
   myeloma cells to form hybridomas, and are cultured in a selective medium (e.g., hypoxanthine,
   aminopterin, thymidine medium, &quot;HAT&quot;). The resulting hybridomas are plated by limiting
   dilution, and are assayed for the production of antibodies which bind specifically to the
   immunizing antigen (and which do not bind to unrelated antigens). The selected Mab-secreting
   hybridomas are then cultured either in vitro (e.g., in tissue culture bottles or hollow fiber
   reactors), or in vivo (as ascites in mice). </p>
  <p>[0141] Other methods for sustaining antibody-producing B-cell clones, such as by EBV
   transformation, are known. </p>
  <p>[0142] If desired, the antibodies (whether polyclonal or monoclonal) may be labeled using
   conventional techniques. Suitable labels include fluorophores, chromophores, radioactive atoms
   (particularly &lt;32&gt;P and &lt;125&gt;I), electron-dense reagents, enzymes, and ligands having
   specific binding partners. Enzymes are typically detected by their activity. For example,
   horseradish peroxidase is usually detected by its ability to convert
   3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TNB) to a blue pigment, quantifiable with a spectrophotometer. </p>
  <p> A.2 In Vitro Applications of Polypeptides </p>
  <p>[0143] Some polypeptides of the invention will have enzymatic activities that are useful in
   vitro. For example, the soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) family is one of the numerous families
   of proteinase inhibitors. It comprises plant proteins which have inhibitory activity against
   serine proteinases from the trypsin and subtilisin families, thiol proteinases and aspartic
   proteinases. Thus, these peptides find in vitro use in protein purification protocols and perhaps
   in therapeutic settings requiring topical application of protease inhibitors. </p>
  <p>[0144] Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.24) (ALAD) catalyzes the second step in
   the biosynthesis of heme, the condensation of two molecules of 5-aminolevulinate to form
   porphobilinogen and is also involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis(<ref type="npl">Kaczor et al. (1994) Plant
   Physiol. 1-4: 1411-7</ref>; <ref type="npl">Smith (1988) Biochem. J. 249: 423-8</ref>; <ref type="npl">Schneider (1976) Z. naturforsch. [C]
   31: 55-63</ref>). Thus, ALAD proteins can be used as catalysts in synthesis of heme derivatives.
   Enzymes of biosynthetic pathways generally can be used as catalysts for in vitro synthesis of the
   compounds representing products of the pathway. </p>
  <p>[0145] Polypeptides encoded by SDFs of the invention can be engineered to provide purification
   reagents to identify and purify additional polypeptides that bind to them. This allows one to
   identify proteins that function as multimers or elucidate signal transduction or metabolic
   pathways. In the case of DNA binding proteins, the polypeptide can be used in a similar manner to
   identify the DNA determinants of specific binding (<ref type="npl">S. Pierrou et al., Anal. Biochem. 229:99
   (1995)</ref>, <ref type="npl">S. Chusacultanachai et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:23591 (1999)</ref>, <ref type="npl">Q. Lin et al., J. Biol.
   Chem.272:27274 (1997)</ref>). </p>
  <p> II.B . POLYPEPTIDE VARIANTS , FRAGMENTS, AND FUSIONS </p>
  <p>[0146] Generally, variants , fragments, or fusions of the polypeptides encoded by the SDFs of
   the invention can exhibit at least one of the activities of the identified domains and/or related
   polypeptides described in Table 1 corresponding to the SDF of interest. </p>
  <p> II.B .(1) Variants </p>
  <p>[0147] A type of variant of the native polypeptides comprises amino acid substitutions.
   Conservative substitutions, described above (see II.), are preferred to maintain the function or
   activity of the polypeptide. Such substitutions include conservation of charge, polarity,
   hydrophobicity, size, etc. For example, one or more amino acid residues within the sequence can
   be substituted with another amino acid of similar polarity that acts as a functional equivalent,
   for example providing a hydrogen bond in an enzymatic catalysis. Substitutes for an amino acid
   within an exemplified sequence are preferably made among the members of the class to which the
   amino acid belongs. For example, the nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine,
   isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine. The polar neutral amino
   acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine. The
   positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. The negatively
   charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. </p>
  <p>[0148] Within the scope of percentage of sequence identity described above, a polypeptide of
   the invention may have additional individual amino acids or amino acid sequences inserted into
   the polypeptide in the middle thereof and/or at the N-terminal and/or C-terminal ends thereof.
   Likewise, some of the amino acids or amino acid sequences may be deleted from the polypeptide.
   Amino acid substitutions may also be made in the sequences; conservative substitutions being
   preferred. </p>
  <p>[0149] One preferred class of variants are those that comprise (1) the domain of an encoded
   polypeptide and/or (2) residues conserved between the encoded polypeptide and related
   polypeptides. For this class of variants, the encoded polypeptide sequence is changed by
   insertion, deletion, or substitution at positions flanking the domain and/or conserved residues. </p>
  <p>[0150] Another class of variants includes those that comprise an encoded polypeptide sequence
   that is changed in the domain or conserved residues by a conservative substitution. </p>
  <p>[0151] Yet another class of variants includes those that lack one of the in vitro activities,
   or structural features of the encoded polypeptides. One example is polypeptides or proteins
   produced from genes comprising dominant negative mutations. Such a variant may comprise an
   encoded polypeptide sequence with non-conservative changes in a particular domain or group of
   conserved residues. </p>
  <p> II.A.(2) FRAGMENTS </p>
  <p>[0152] Fragments of particular interest are those that comprise a domain identified for a
   polypeptide encoded by an SDF of the instant invention and variants thereof. Also, fragments that
   comprise at least one region of residues conserved between an SDF encoded polypeptide and its
   related polypeptides are of great interest. Fragments are sometimes useful as polypeptides
   corresponding to genes comprising dominant negative mutations are. </p>
  <p> II.A.(3)FUSIONS </p>
  <p>[0153] Of interest are chimeras comprising (1) a fragment of the SDF encoded polypeptide or
   variants thereof of interest and (2) a fragment of a polypeptide comprising the same domain. For
   example, an AP2 helix encoded by a SDF of the invention fused to second AP2 helix from ANT
   protein, which comprises two AP2 helices. The present invention also encompasses fusions of SDF
   encoded polypeptides, variants, or fragments thereof fused with related proteins or fragments
   thereof. </p>
  <p> DEFINITION OF DOMAINS </p>
  <p>[0154] The polypeptides of the invention may possess identifying domains. In addition, the
   domains within the SDF encoded polypeptide can be defined by the region that exhibits at least
   70% sequence identity with the consensus sequences listed in the detailed description below of
   each of the domains. </p>
  <p>[0155] The majority of the protein domain descriptions given below are obtained from Prosite,
   (http//www.expasy.ch/prosite/), and Pfam, (http//pfam.wustl.edu/browse.shtml). </p>
  <p> 1. (AAA) AAA-protein family signature </p>
  <p>[0156] A large family of ATPases has been described [1 to 5] whose key feature is that they
   share a conserved region of about 220 amino acids that contains anATP-binding site. This family
   is now called AAA, for 'A'TPases 'A'ssociated with diverse cellular 'A'ctivities. The proteins
   that belong to this family either contain one or two AAA domains. Proteins containing two AAA
   domains: Mammalian and drosophila NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein) and the fungal
   homolog, SEC 18. These proteins are involved in intracellular transport between the endoplasmic
   reticulum and Golgi, as well as between different Golgi cisternae. Mammalian transitional
   endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (previously known as p97 or VCP) which is involved in the transfer
   of membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus. This protein forms a
   ring-shaped homooligomer composed of six subunits. The yeast homolog is CDC48 and it may play a
   role in spindle pole proliferation. Yeast protein PAS1, essential for peroxisome assembly and the
   related protein PAS1 from Pichia pastoris. Yeast protein AFG2. Sulfolobus acidocaldarius protein
   SAV and Halobacterium salinarium cdcH which may be part of a transduction pathway connecting
   light to cell division. Proteins containing a single AAA domain: Escherichia coli and other
   bacteria ftsH (or hflB) protein. FtsH is an ATP-dependent zinc metallopeptidase that seems to
   degrade the heat-shock sigma-32 factor. </p>
  <p>[0157] It is an integral membrane protein with a large cytoplasmic C-terminal domain that
   contain both the AAA and the protease domains. Yeast protein YME1, a protein important for
   maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial compartment. YME1 is also a zinc-dependent
   protease. Yeast protein AFG3 (or YTA10). This protein also seems to contain a AAA domain followed
   by a zinc-dependent protease domain. </p>
  <p>[0158] Subunits from the regulatory complex of the 26S proteasome [6] which is involved in the
   ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins: a) Mammalian subunit 4 and homologs in other
   higher eukaryotes, in yeast (gene YTA5) and fission yeast (gene mts2). b) Mammalian subunit 6
   (TBP7) and homologs in other higher eukaryotes and in yeast (gene YTA2). c) Mammalian subunit 7
   (MSS1) and homologs in other higher eukaryotes and in yeast (gene CIM5 or YTA3). d) Mammalian
   subunit 8 (P45) and homologs in other higher eukaryotes and in yeast (SUG1 or CIM3 or TBY1) and
   fission yeast (gene let1). </p>
  <p>[0159] Other probable subunits such as human TBP1 which seems to influences HIV gene expression
   by interacting with the virus tat transactivator protein and yeast YTA1 and YTA6. Yeast protein
   BCS1, a mitochondrial protein essential for the expression of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein.
   Yeast protein MSP1, a protein involved in intramitochondrial sorting of proteins. Yeast protein
   PAS8, and the corresponding proteins PAS5 from Pichia pastoris and PAY4 from Yarrowia lipolytica.
   Mouse protein SKD1 and its fission yeast homolog (SpAC2G11.06). Caenorhabditis elegans meiotic
   spindle formation protein mei-1. Yeast protein SAP1. Yeast protein YTA7. Mycobacterium leprae
   hypothetical protein A2126A. </p>
  <p>[0160] It is proposed that, in general, the AAA domains in these proteins act as ATP-dependent
   protein clamps [5]. In addition to the ATP-binding 'A' and 'B' motifs, which are located in the
   N-terminal half of this domain, there is a highly conserved region located in the central part of
   the domain which was used to develop a signature pattern. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 2. ABC Membrane (ABC transporter transmembrane region). </p>
  <p>[0161] This family represents a unit of six transmembrane helices. Many members of the ABC
   transporter family (ABC_tran)have two such regions. See also descriptions of ABC Tran, below, and
   ABC2 membrane, above. </p>
  <p> 3. (ABC Tran) ABC transporters family signature. </p>
  <p>[0162] On the basis of sequence similarities a family of related ATP-bindingproteins has been
   characterized [1 to 5]. These proteins are associated with avariety of distinct biological
   processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but a majority of them are involved in active
   transport of small hydrophilic molecules across the cytoplasmic membrane. All these proteins
   share a conserved domain of some two hundred amino acid residues, which includes an ATP-binding
   site. These proteins are collectively known as ABC transporters. Proteins known to belong to this

   high affinity transport system. - yhbG, a putative protein whose gene is linked with ntrA in many
   bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas putida, Rhizobium meliloti

   ytfR.In eukaryotes: - The multidrug transporters (Mdr) (P-glycoprotein), a family of closely
   related proteins which extrude a wide variety of drugs out of the cell (for a review see [8]). -
   Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is most probably involved in
   the transport of chloride ions. - Antigen peptide transporters 1 (TAP1, PSF1, RING4, HAM-1, mtp1)

   tagB from slime mold. This protein consists of two domains: a N-terminal subtilase catalytic
   domain and a C-terminal ABC transporter domain.As a signature pattern for this class of proteins,
   a conserved region which is located between the 'A' and the 'B' motifs of the ATP-binding site
   was used. Consensus pattern:
   [LIVMFYC]-[SA]-[SAPGLVFYKQH]-G-[DENQMW]-[KRQASPCLIMFW]-[KRNQSTAVM]-[KRACLVM]-[LIVMFYPAN]-{PHY}-[LIVMFW]-[SAGCLIVP]-{FYWHP}-{KRHP
   }-[LIVMFYWSTA] The ATP-binding region is duplicated in araG, mdl, msrA, rbsA, tlrC, uvrA, yejF,
   Mdr's, CFTR, pmdl and in EF-3. In some of those proteins, the above pattern only detect one of
   the two copies of the domain. The proteins belonging to this family also contain one or two
   copies of the ATP-binding motifs 'A' and 'B'. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Higgins C.F., Hyde S.C., Mimmack M.M., Gileadi

  <p> 4. (ACBP) </p>
  <p> Acyl-CoA-binding protein signature </p>
  <p>[0163] Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) is a small (10 Kd) protein that binds medium- and
   long-chain acyl-CoA esters with very high affinity and may function as an intracellular carrier
   of acyl-CoA esters [1]. ACBP is also known as diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) or endozepine (EP)
   because of its ability to displace diazepam from the benzodiazepine (BZD) recognition site
   located on the GABA type A receptor. It is therefore possible that this protein also acts as a
   neuropeptide to modulate the action of the GABA receptor [2].ACBP is a highly conserved protein
   of about 90 residues that has been so far found in vertebrates, insects and yeast. ACBP is also
   related to the N-terminal section of a probable transmembrane protein of unknown function
   whichhas been found in mammals. As a signature pattern, the region that corresponds to residues
   19 to 37 in mammalian ACBP was selected. Consensus pattern:

   synthase and selenide, water dikinase. </p>
  <p> 6. (AMP-binding) </p>
  <p> Putative AMP-binding domain signature </p>
  <p>[0165] It has been shown [1 to 5] that a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes which all
   probably act via an ATP-dependent covalent binding of AMP to their substrate, share a region of
   sequence similarity. These enzymes are: - Insects luciferase (luciferin 4-monooxygenase).
   Luciferase produces light by catalyzing the oxidation of luciferin in presence of ATP and
   molecular oxygen. - Alpha-aminoadipate reductase from yeast (gene LYS2). This enzyme catalyzes
   the activation of alpha-aminoadipate by ATP-dependent adenylation and the reduction of activated
   alpha-aminoadipate by NADPH. - Acetate--CoA ligase (acetyl-CoA synthetase), an enzyme that
   catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA from acetate and CoA. - Long-chain-fatty-acid--CoA ligase,
   an enzyme that activates long-chain fatty acids for both the synthesis of cellular lipids and
   their degradation via beta-oxidation.-4-coumarate--CoA ligase (4CL), a plant enzyme that
   catalyzes the formation of 4-coumarate-CoA from 4-coumarate and coenzyme A; the branchpoint
   reactions between general phenylpropanoid metabolism and pathways leading to various specific end
   products.-O-succinylbenzoic acid--CoA ligase (OSB-CoA synthetase) (gene menE) [6], a bacterial
   enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of menaquinone (vitamin K2). - 4-Chlorobenzoate--CoA ligase
   (EC 6.2.1.-) (4-CBA--CoA ligase) [7], a Pseudomonas enzyme involved in the degradation of 4-CBA.-
   Indoleacetate--lysine ligase (IAA-lysine synthetase) [8], an enzyme from Pseudomonas syringae
   that converts indoleacetate to IAA-lysine. - Bile acid-CoA ligase (gene baiB) from Eubacterium
   strain VPI 12708 [4]. This enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of a variety of C-24 bile
   acid-CoA. - Crotonobetaine/camitine-CoA ligase (EC 6.3.2.-) from Escherichia coli (gene caiC). -
   L-(alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACV synthetase) from various fungi (gene
   acvA or pcbAB). This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of penicillin and
   cephalosporin, the formation of ACV from the constituent amino acids. The amino acids seem to be
   activated by adenylation. It is a protein of around 3700 amino acids that contains three related
   domains of about 1000 amino acids. - Gramicidin S synthetase I (gene grsA) from Bacillus brevis.
   This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of the cyclic antibiotic gramicidin S,
   the ATP-dependent racemization of phenylalanine- Tyrocidine synthetase I (gene tycA) from
   Bacillus brevis. The reaction carried out by tycA is identical to that catalyzed by grsA -
   Gramicidin S synthetase II (gene grsB) from Bacillus brevis. This enzyme is a multifunctional
   protein that activates and polymerizes proline, valine, ornithine and leucine. GrsB consists of
   four related domains. - Enterobactin synthetase components E (gene entE) and F (gene entF) from
   Escherichia coli. These two enzymes are involved in the ATP-dependent activation of respectively
   2,3-dihydroxybenzoate and serine during enterobactin (enterochelin) biosynthesis. - Cyclic
   peptide antibiotic surfactin synthase subunits 1, 2 and 3 from Bacillus subtilis. Subunits 1 and
   2 contains three related domains while subunit 3 only contains a single domain. - HC-toxin
   synthetase (gene HTS1) from Cochliobolus carbonum. This enzyme activates the four amino acids
   (Pro, L-Ala, D-Ala and 2-amino-9,10-epoxi-8-oxodecanoic acid) that make up HC-toxin, a cyclic
   tetrapeptide. HTS1 consists of four related domains.There are also some proteins, whose exact
   function is not yet known, but whichare, very probably, also AMP-binding enzymes. These proteins
   are: - ORA (octapeptide-repeat antigen), a Plasmodium falciparum protein whose function is not
   known but which shows a high degree of similarity with the above proteins. - AngR, a Vibrio
   anguillarum protein. AngR is thought to be a transcriptional activator which modulates the
   anguibactin (an iron-binding siderophore) biosynthesis gene cluster operon. But it is believed
   [9], that angR is not a DNA-binding protein, but rather an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of
   anguibactin. This conclusion is based on three facts: the presence of the AMP-binding domain; the
   size of angR (1048 residues), which is far bigger than any bacterial transcriptional protein; and

   gamma is believed to be important in regulating ATPase activity and the flow of protons through

  <p>[0173] ATP synthase (proton-translocating ATPase) [1,2] is a component of the cytoplasmic
   membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria,and the thylakoid membrane of
   chloroplasts. The ATPase complex is composed of an oligomeric transmembrane sector, called CF(0),
   and a catalytic core, called coupling factor CF(1). The former acts as a proton channel; the
   latter is composed of five subunits, alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon. The sequences of
   subunits alpha and beta are related and both contain a nucleotide-binding site for ATP and ADP.
   The beta chain has catalytic activity, while the alpha chain is a regulatory subunit. Vacuolar
   ATPases [3] (V-ATPases) are responsible for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in
   eukaryotic cells. Like F-ATPases, they are oligomeric complexes of a transmembrane and a
   catalytic sector. The sequenceof the largest subunit of the catalytic sector (70 Kd) is related
   to that ofF-ATPase beta subunit, while a 60 Kd subunit, from the same sector, is related to the
   F-ATPases alpha subunit [4].Archaebacterial membrane-associated ATPases are composed of three
   subunits.The alpha chain is related to F-ATPases beta chain and the beta chain is related to
   F-ATPases alpha chain [4].A protein highly similar to F-ATPase beta subunits is found [5] in some
   bacterial apparatus involved in a specialized protein export pathway that proceeds without signal
   peptide cleavage. This protein is known as fliI in Bacillus and Salmonella, Spa47 (mxiB) in
   Shigella flexneri, HrpB6 in Xanthomonas campestris and yscN in Yersinia virulence plasmids.To
   detect these ATPase subunits, a segment often amino-acid residues, containing two conserved
   serines, as a signature pattern was selected. The first serine seems to be important for
   catalysis - in the ATPase alpha chain at least - as its mutagenesis causes catalytic impairment.

  <p>[0177] Aconitase (aconitate hydratase) (EC 4.2.1.3) [1] is the enzyme from the tricarboxylic
   acid cycle that catalyzes the reversible isomerization of citrate and isocitrate. Cis-aconitate
   is formed as an intermediary product during the course of the reaction. In eukaryotes two
   isozymes of aconitase are known to exist: one found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other
   found in the cytoplasm. Aconitase, in its active form, contains a 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster;
   three cysteine residues have been shown to be ligands of the 4Fe-4S cluster. It has been shown
   that the aconitase family also contains the followingproteins: - Iron-responsive element binding
   protein (IRE-BP). IRE-BP is a cytosolic protein that binds to iron-responsive elements (IREs).
   IREs are stem-loop structures found in the 5'UTR of ferritin, and delta aminolevulinic acid
   synthase mRNAs, and in the 3'UTR of transferrin receptor mRNA. IRE-BP also express aconitase
   activity. - 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.33) (isopropylmalate isomerase), the enzyme
   that catalyzes the second step in the biosynthesis of leucine. - Homoaconitase (EC 4.2.1.36)
   (homoaconitate hydratase), an enzyme that participates in the alpha-aminoadipate pathway of
   lysine biosynthesis and that converts cis-homoaconitate into homoisocitric acid. - Esherichia

   protein. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are FAD flavoproteins. This family currently includes: - Five
   eukaryotic isozymes that catalyze the first step of the beta-oxidation cycles for fatty acids
   with various chain lengths. These are short (SCAD) (EC 1.3.99.2), medium (MCAD) (EC 1.3.99.3),
   long (LCAD) (EC 1.3.99.13), very-long (VLCAD) and short/branched (SBCAD) chain acyl-CoA
   dehydrogenases. These enzymes are located in the mitochondrion. They are all homotetrameric
   proteins of about 400 amino acid residues except VLCAD which is a dimer and which contains, in
   its mature form, about 600 residues. - Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7) (GCDH), which is
   involved in the catabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan. - Isovaleryl-CoA

  <p> Clathrin adaptor complexes medium chain signatures. </p>
  <p>[0181] Clathrin coated vesicles (CCV) mediate intracellular membrane traffic such asreceptor

   components including oligomeric complexes which are knownas adaptor or clathrin assembly proteins
   (AP) complexes [1]. The adaptor complexes are believed to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of
   membrane proteins, leading to their selection and concentration. In mammals two type of adaptor
   complexes are known: AP-1 which is associated with the Golgi complex and AP-2 which is associated
   with the plasma membrane. Both AP-1 and AP-2 are heterotetramers that consist of two large chains
   - the adaptins - (gamma and beta' in AP-1; alpha and beta in AP-2); a medium chain (AP47 in AP-1;
   AP50 inAP-2) and a small chain (AP19 in AP-1; AP17 in AP-2). The medium chains of AP-1 and AP-2
   are evolutionary related proteins of about 50 Kd. Homologs of AP47 and AP50 have also been found
   in Caenorhabditis elegans (genes unc-101 and ap50) [2] and yeast (gene APM1 or YAP54) [3].Some
   more divergent, but clearly evolutionary related proteins have also been found in yeast: APM2 and

  <p>[0185] Aldose 1-epimerase putative active site Aldose 1-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.3) (mutarotase) is
   the enzyme responsible for the anomeric interconversion of D-glucose and other aldoses between
   their alpha- and beta-forms. The sequence of mutarotase from two bacteria, Acinetobacter
   calcoaceticus and Streptococcus thermophilus is available [1]. It has also been shown that, on
   the basis of extensive sequence similarities, a mutarotase domain seem to be present in the
   C-terminal half of the fungal GAL10 protein which encodes, in the N-terminal part, for
   UDP-glucose 4-epimerase. The best conserved region in the sequence of mutarotase is centered
   around a conserved histidine residue which may be involved in the catalytic mechanism. Consensus

  <p> 27. (AlkA DNA repair) </p>
  <p> Alkylbase DNA glycosidases alkA family signature </p>
  <p>[0186] Alkylbase DNA glycosidases [1] are DNA repair enzymes that hydrolyzes the deoxyribose
   N-glycosidic bond to excise various alkylated bases from a damaged DNA polymer. In Escherichia
   coli there are two alkylbase DNA glycosidases: one (gene tag)which is constitutively expressed
   and which is specific for the removal of 3-methyladenine (EC 3.2.2.20), and one (gene alkA) which
   is induced during adaptation to alkylation and which can remove a variety of alkylation products
   (EC 3.2.2.21). Tag and alkA do not share any region of sequence similarity. In yeast there is an
   alkylbase DNA glycosidase (gene MAG1) [2,3], which can remove 3-methyladenine or 7-methyladenine
   and which is structurally related to alkA. MAG and alkA are both proteins of about 300 amino acid
   residues. While the C- and N-terminal ends appear to be unrelated, there is a central region of
   about 130 residues which is well conserved. A portion of this region has been selected as a
   signature pattern . Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0187] A number of proteins involved in the transport of ammonium ions across amembrane as well

   proteins C05E11.4, F49E11.3 and M195.3. As expected by their transport function, these proteins
   are highly hydrophobic and seem to contain from 10 to 12 transmembrane domains. The best

  <p> CBF/NF-Y subunits signatures </p>
  <p>[0188] Diverse DNA binding proteins are known to bind the CCAAT box, a common cis-acting
   element found in the promoter and enhancer regions of a large number of genes in eukaryotes.
   Amongst these proteins is one known as the CCAAT-binding factor (CBF) or NF-Y [1]. CBF is a
   heteromeric transcription factor that consists of two different components both needed for
   DNA-binding. The HAP protein complex of yeast binds to the upstream activation site of cytochrome
   C iso-1 gene (CYC1) as well as other genes involved in mitochondrial electron transport and
   activates their expression. It also recognizes the sequence CCAAT and is structurally and
   evolutionary related to CBF. The first subunit of CBF, known as CBF-A or NF-YB in vertebrates,
   HAP3 in budding yeast and as php3 in fission yeast, is a protein of 116 to 210 amino-acid
   residues which contains a highly conserved central domain of about 90residues. This domain seems
   to be involved in DNA-binding; a signature pattern had been developed from its central part. The
   second subunit of CBF, known as CBF-B or NF-YA in vertebrates, HAP2 in budding yeast and php2 in
   fission yeast, is a protein of 265 to 350 amino-acid residues which contains a highly conserved
   region of about 60 residues. This region, called the 'essential core' [2], seems to consist of
   two subdomains: an N-terminal subunit-association domain and a C-terminal DNA recognition domain.
   A signature pattern has been developed from a section of the subunit-association domain.

  <p>[0189] Argininosuccinate synthase (EC 6.3.4.5) (AS) is a urea cycle enzyme that catalyzes the
   penultimate step in arginine biosynthesis: the ATP-dependent ligation of citrulline to aspartate
   to form argininosuccinate, AMP andpyrophosphate [1,2].In humans, a defect in the AS gene causes
   citrullinemia, a genetic disease characterized by severe vomiting spells and mental
   retardation.AS is a homotetrameric enzyme of chains of about 400 amino-acid residues. Anarginine
   seems to be important for the enzyme's catalytic mechanism. The sequences of AS from various
   prokaryotes, archaebacteria and eukaryotes show significant similarity. Two signature patterns
   have been selected for AS. The first is a highly conserved stretch of nine residues located in
   the N-terminal extremity of these enzymes, the second is derived from a conserved region which
   contains one of the conserved arginine residues. Consensus pattern:

  <p> Aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases class-II signatures </p>
  <p>[0192] Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (EC 6.1.1.-) [1] are a group of enzymes which activate amino
   acids and transfer them to specific tRNA molecules as the first step in protein biosynthesis. In
   prokaryotic organisms there are at least twenty different types of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases,
   one for each different amino acid. In eukaryotes there are generally two aminoacyl-tRNA
   synthetases for each different amino acid: one cytosolic form and a mitochondrial form. While all
   these enzymes have a common function, they are widely diverse in terms of subunit size and of
   quaternary structure. The synthetases specific for alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine,
   histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, and threonine are referred to as class-II
   synthetases [2 to 6] and probably have a common folding pattern in their catalytic domain for the
   binding of ATP and amino acid which is different to the Rossmann fold observed for the class I
   synthetases [7]. Class-II tRNA synthetases do not share a high degree of similarity, however at
   least three conserved regions are present [2,5,8]. Signature patterns have been derived from two
   of these regions. Consensus pattern: [FYH]-R-x-[DE]-x(4,12)-[RH]-x(3)-F-x(3)-[DE] Consensus

   is formed as an intermediary product during the course of the reaction. In eukaryotes two

   three cysteine residues have been shown to be ligands of the 4Fe-4S cluster. It has been shown
   that the aconitase family also contains the following proteins: - Iron-responsive element binding
   protein (IRE-BP). IRE-BP is a cytosolic protein that binds to iron-responsive elements (IREs).
   IREs are stem-loop structures found in the 5'UTR of ferritin, and delta aminolevulinic acid
   synthase mRNAs, and in the 3'UTR of transferrin receptor mRNA. IRE-BP also express aconitase
   activity. - 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.33) (isopropylmalate isomerase), the enzyme

  <p> 42. Actins signatures </p>
  <p>[0202] Actins [1 to 4] are highly conserved contractile proteins that are present in all
   eukaryotic cells. In vertebrates there are three groups of actin isoforms: alpha, beta and gamma.
   The alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and are a major constituent of the contractile
   apparatus. The beta and gamma actins co-exists in most cell types as components of the
   cytoskeleton and as mediators of internal cell motility. In plants [5] there are many isoforms
   which are probably involved in a variety of functions such as cytoplasmic streaming, cell shape
   determination, tip growth, graviperception, cell wall deposition, etc. Actin exists either in a
   monomeric form (G-actin) or in a polymerized form (F-actin). Each actin monomer can bind a
   molecule of ATP; when polymerization occurs, the ATP is hydrolyzed. Actin is a protein of from
   374 to 379 amino acid residues. The structure of actin has been highly conserved in the course of
   evolution. Recently some divergent actin-like proteins have been identified in several species.
   These proteins are: - Centractin (actin-RPV) from mammals, fungi (yeast ACT5, Neurospora crassa
   ro-4) and Pneumocystis carinii (actin-II). Centractin seems to be a component of a multi-subunit
   centrosomal complex involved in microtubule based vesicle motility. This subfamily is also known
   as ARP1. - ARP2 subfamily which includes chicken ACTL, yeast ACT2, Drosophila 14D, C.elegans
   actC. - ARP3 subfamily which includes actin 2 from mammals, Drosophila 66B, yeast ACT4 and
   fission yeast act2. - ARP4 subfamily which includes yeast ACT3 and Drosophila 13E. Three
   signature patterns have been developed. The first two are specific to actins and span positions
   54 to 64 and 357 to 365. The last signature picks up both actins and the actin-like proteins and
   corresponds to positions 106 to 118 in actins. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 43. Adenylate kinase signature </p>
  <p>[0203] Adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3) (AK) [1] is a small monomeric enzyme that catalyzes the
   reversible transfer of MgATP to AMP (MgATP + AMP = MgADP + ADP).In mammals there are three
   different isozymes: - AK1 (or myokinase), which is cytosolic. - AK2, which is located in the
   outer compartment of mitochondria. - AK3 (or GTP:AMP phosphotransferase), which is located in the
   mitochondrial matrix and which uses MgGTP instead of MgATP.The sequence of AK has also been
   obtained from different bacterial species and from plants and fungi. Two other enzymes have been
   found to be evolutionary related to AK. These are: - Yeast uridylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.-) (UK)
   (gene URA6) [2] which catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to UMP to form UDP and
   ADP. - Slime mold UMP-CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14) [3] which catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate
   group from ATP to either CMP or UMP to form CDP or UDP and ADP. Several regions of AK family
   enzymes are well conserved, including the ATP-binding domains. The most conserved of all regions
   have been selected as a signature for this type of enzyme. This region includes an aspartic acid
   residue that is part of the catalytic cleft of the enzyme and that is involved in a salt bridge.
   It also includes an arginine residue whose modification leads to inactivation of the enzyme

  <p> 46. (adh_zinc) Zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases signatures </p>
  <p>[0206] Alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) (ADH) catalyzes the reversible oxidation of ethanol
   to acetaldehyde with the concomitant reduction of NAD [1]. Currently three, structurally and
   catalytically, different types of alcohol dehydrogenases are known: - Zinc-containing
   'long-chain' alcohol dehydrogenases. - Insect-type, or 'short-chain' alcohol dehydrogenases. -
   Iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases.Zinc-containing ADH's [2,3] are dimeric or tetrameric
   enzymes that bind two atoms of zinc per subunit. One of the zinc atom is essential for catalytic
   activity while the other is not. Both zinc atoms are coordinated by either cysteine or histidine
   residues; the catalytic zinc is coordinated by two cysteines and one histidine. Zinc-containing
   ADH's are found in bacteria, mammals, plants, and in fungi. In most species there are more than
   one isozyme (for example, human have at least six isozymes, yeast have three, etc.). A number of
   other zinc-dependent dehydrogenases are closely related to zinc ADH [4], these are: - Xylitol
   dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.9) (D-xylulose reductase). - Sorbitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.14). -
   Aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.90) (benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase). - Threonine
   3-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103). - Cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.195) (CAD) [5]. CAD is
   a plant enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of lignin. - Galactitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC
   1.1.1.251). - Pseudomonas putida 5-exo-alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.-) [6]. - Escherichia coli
   starvation sensing protein rspB. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjgB. - Escherichia coli
   hypothetical protein yjgV. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjjN. - Yeast hypothetical
   protein YAL060w (FUN49). - Yeast hypothetical protein YAL061w (FUN50). - Yeast hypothetical
   protein YCR105w. The pattern that has been developed to detect this class of enzymes is based on
   a conserved region that includes a histidine residue which is the second ligand of the catalytic
   zinc atom. This family also includes NADP-dependent quinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.5.5),an enzyme
   found in bacteria (gene qor), in yeast and in mammals where, in some species such as rodents, it
   has been recruited as an eye lens protein and is known as zeta-crystallin [7]. The sequence of
   quinone oxidoreductase is distantly related to that other zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases
   and it lacks the zinc-ligand residues. The torpedo fish and mammlian synaptic vesicle membrane
   protein vat-1 is related to qor. A specific pattern has been developed for this subfamily.

  <p> 47. (aldedh) Aldehyde dehydrogenases active sites </p>
  <p>[0207] Aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3 and EC 1.2.1.5) are enzymes which oxidize a wide
   variety of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. In mammals at least four different forms of the
   enzyme are known [1]: class-1 (or Ald C) a tetrameric cytosolic enzyme, class-2 (or Ald M) a
   tetrameric mitochondrial enzyme, class-3 (or Ald D) a dimeric cytosolic enzyme, and class IV a
   microsomal enzyme. Aldehyde dehydrogenases have also been sequenced from fungal and bacterial
   species. A number of enzymes are known to be evolutionary related to aldehyde dehydrogenases;
   these enzymes are listed below. - Plants and bacterial betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC
   1.2.1.8) [2], an enzyme that catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of betaine. - Plants and
   bacterial NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.9). - Escherichia
   coli succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.2.1.16) (gene gabD) [3], which reduces
   succinate semialdehyde into succinate. - Escherichia coli lactaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC
   1.2.1.22) (gene ald) [4]. - Mammalian succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) (EC 1.2.1.24).
   - Escherichia coli phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.39). - Escherichia coli
   5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (gene hpcC). - Pseudomonas putida
   2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase [5] (genes dmpC and xylG), an enzyme in the
   meta-cleavage pathway for the degradation of phenols, cresols and catechol. - Bacterial and
   mammalian methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH) (EC 1.2.1.27) [6], an enzyme involved
   in the distal pathway of valine catabolism. - Yeast delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase
   (EC 1.5.1.12) [7] (gene PUT2), which converts proline to glutamate. - Bacterial multifunctional
   putA protein, which contains a delta-1-pyrroline- 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase domain. - 26G, a
   garden pea protein of unknown function which is induced by dehydration of shoots [8]. - Mammalian
   formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.6) [9]. This is a cytosolic enzyme responsible for
   the NADP-dependent decarboxylative reduction of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate.
   It is an protein of about 900 amino acids which consist of three domains; the C- terminal domain

   dependent enzymes, such as the covalent binding of the pyridoxal- phosphate group to a lysine
   residue. On the basis of sequence similarity, these various enzymes can be grouped [1,2] into
   subfamilies. One of these, called class-I, currently consists of the following enzymes: -
   Aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) (EC 2.6.1.1). AAT catalyzes the reversible transfer of the amino
   group from L-aspartate to 2-oxoglutarate to form oxaloacetate and L-glutamate. In eukaryotes,
   there are two AAT isozymes: one is located in the mitochondrial matrix, the second is
   cytoplasmic. In prokaryotes, only one form of AAT is found (gene aspC). - Tyrosine
   aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.5) which catalyzes the first step in tyrosine catabolism by reversibly
   transferring its amino group to 2- oxoglutarate to form 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and L-glutamate.
   - Aromatic aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.57) involved in the synthesis of Phe, Tyr, Asp and Leu
   (gene tyrB). - 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (EC 4.4.1.14) (ACC synthase) from

   which catalyzes the eighth step in histidine biosynthetic pathway: the transfer of an amino group
   from 3-(imidazol-4-yl)-2-oxopropyl phosphate to glutamic acid to form histidinol phosphate and
   2-oxoglutarate. - Serine palmitoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.50) from yeast (genes LCB1 and LCB2),

   interconversion of phosphoserine and 2-oxoglutarate to 3-phosphonooxypyruvate and glutamate. It
   is required both in the major phosphorylated pathway of serine biosynthesis and in pyridoxine

  <p> 56. Annexins repeated domain signature </p>
  <p>[0217] Annexins [1 to 6] are a group of calcium-binding proteins that associate reversibly with
   membranes. They bind to phospholipid bilayers in the presence of micromolar free calcium
   concentration. The binding is specific for calcium and for acidic phospholipids. Annexins have
   been claimed to be involved in cytoskeletal interactions, phospholipase inhibition, intracellular
   signalling, anticoagulation, and membrane fusion. Each of these proteins consist of an N-terminal
   domain of variable length followed by four or eight copies of a conserved segment of sixty one
   residues. The repeat (sometimes known as an 'endonexin fold') consists of five alpha-helices that
   are wound into a right-handed superhelix [7].The proteins known to belong to the annexin family
   are listed below: - Annexin I (Lipocortin 1) (Calpactin 2) (p35) (Chromobindin 9). - Annexin II
   (Lipocortin 2) (Calpactin 1) (Protein I) (p36) (Chromobindin 8). - Annexin III (Lipocortin 3)
   (PAP-III). - Annexin IV (Lipocortin 4) (Endonexin I) (Protein II) (Chromobindin 4). - Annexin V
   (Lipocortin 5) (Endonexin 2) (VAC-alpha) (Anchorin CII) (PAP-I). - Annexin VI (Lipocortin 6)
   (Protein III) (Chromobindin 20) (p68) (p70). This is the only known annexin that contains 8
   (instead of 4) repeats. - Annexin VII (Synexin). - Annexin VIII (Vascular anticoagulant-beta)
   (VAC-beta). - Annexin IX from Drosophila. - Annexin X from Drosophila. - Annexin XI
   (Calcyclin-associated annexin) (CAP-50). - Annexin XII from Hydra vulgaris. - Annexin XIII
   (Intestine-specific annexin) (ISA).The signature pattern for this domain spans positions 9 to 61

  <p> 57. (arf_1) ADP-ribosylation factors family signature </p>
  <p>[0218] ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF) [1,2,3,4] are 20 Kd GTP-binding proteins involved in
   protein trafficking. They may modulate vesicle budding and uncoating within the Golgi apparatus.
   ARF's also act as allosteric activators of cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. They
   are evolutionary conserved and present in all eukaryotes. At least six forms of ARF are present
   in mammals and three in budding yeast. The ARF family also includes proteins highly related to
   ARF's but which lack the cholera toxin cofactor activity, they are collectively known as ARL's
   (ARF-like).ARD1 is a 64 Kd mammalian protein of unknown biological function that contains an ARF
   domain at its C-terminal extremity. Proteins from the ARF family are generally included in the
   RAS 'superfamily' of small GTP-binding proteins [5], but they are only slightly related to the
   other RAS proteins. They also differ from RAS proteins in that they lack cysteine residues at
   their C-termini and are therefore not subject to prenylation. The ARFs are N-terminally
   myristoylated (the ARLs have not yet been shown to be modified in such a fashion). A conserved
   region in the C-terminal part of ARF's and ARL's has been selected as a signature pattern.

  <p>[0219] From sequence comparisons and crystallographic data analysis it has been shown
   [1,2,3,4,5,6] that an appreciable proportion of proteins that bind ATP or GTP share a number of
   more or less conserved sequence motifs. The best conserved of these motifs is a glycine-rich
   region, which typically forms a flexible loop between a beta-strand and an alpha-helix. This loop
   interacts with one of the phosphate groups of the nucleotide. This sequence motif is generally
   referred to as the 'A' consensus sequence [1] or the 'P-loop' [5].There are numerous ATP- or
   GTP-binding proteins in which the P-loop is found. A number of protein families for which the
   relevance of the presence of such motif has been noted are listed below: - ATP synthase alpha and
   beta subunits (see &lt;PDOC00137&gt;). - Myosin heavy chains. - Kinesin heavy chains and

   proteins escape detection because the structure of their ATP-binding site is completely different
   from that of the P-loop. Examples of such proteins are the E1-E2 ATPases or the glycolytic
   kinases. In other ATP- or GTP-binding proteins the flexible loop exists in a slightly different
   form; this is the case for tubulins or protein kinases. A special mention must be reserved for
   adenylate kinase, in which there is a single deviation from the P-loop pattern: in the last

  <p> 59. (asp) Eukaryotic and viral aspartyl proteases active site </p>
  <p>[0221] Aspartyl proteases, also known as acid proteases, (EC 3.4.23.-) are a widely distributed
   family of proteolytic enzymes [1,2,3] known to exist invertebrates, fungi, plants, retroviruses
   and some plant viruses. Aspartate proteases of eukaryotes are monomeric enzymes which consist of
   two domains. Each domain contains an active site centered on a catalytic aspartyl residue.The two
   domains most probably evolved from the duplication of an ancestral gene encoding a primordial
   domain. Currently known eukaryotic aspartyl proteases are: - Vertebrate gastric pepsins A and C
   (also known as gastricsin). - Vertebrate chymosin (rennin), involved in digestion and used for
   making cheese. - Vertebrate lysosomal cathepsins D (EC 3.4.23.5) and E (EC 3.4.23.34). -
   Mammalian renin (EC 3.4.23.15) whose function is to generate angiotensin I from angiotensinogen
   in the plasma. - Fungal proteases such as aspergillopepsin A (EC 3.4.23.18), candidapepsin (EC
   3.4.23.24), mucoropepsin (EC 3.4.23.23) (mucor rennin), endothiapepsin (EC 3.4.23.22),
   polyporopepsin (EC 3.4.23.29), and rhizopuspepsin (EC 3.4.23.21). - Yeast saccharopepsin (EC
   3.4.23.25) (proteinase A) (gene PEP4). PEP4 is implicated in posttranslational regulation of
   vacuolar hydrolases. - Yeast barrier pepsin (EC 3.4.23.35) (gene BAR1); a protease that cleaves
   alpha-factor and thus acts as an antagonist of the mating pheromone. - Fission yeast sxal which
   is involved in degrading or processing the mating pheromones. Most retroviruses and some plant
   viruses, such as badnaviruses, encode for anaspartyl protease which is an homodimer of a chain of
   about 95 to 125 amino acids. In most retroviruses, the protease is encoded as a segment of
   apolyprotein which is cleaved during the maturation process of the virus. It is generally part of
   the pol polyprotein and, more rarely, of the gagpolyprotein. Conservation of the sequence around
   the two aspartates of eukaryotic aspartyl proteases and around the single active site of the
   viral proteases allows us to develop a single signature pattern for both groups of protease.

   mediates homomeric dimerisation and in some instances heteromeric dimerisation [2].The structure

   flanked by short beta-sheets at both the top and bottom of the molecule [3]. POZ domains from
   several zinc finger proteins have been shown to mediate transcriptional repression and to
   interact with components of histone deacetylase co-repressor complexes including N-CoR and SMRT

   operon of: Aeromonas (gene exeD); Erwinia (gene outD); Escherichia coli (gene yheF), Klebsiella
   pneumoniae (gene pulD); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gene xcpQ); Vibrio cholerae (gene epsD) and

   (DNA uptake). - pilQ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is essential for the formation of the
   pili. - hofQ (hopQ) from Escherichia coli. - hrpH from Pseudomonas syringae, which is involved in
   the secretion of a proteinaceous elicitor of the hypersensitivity response in plants. - hrpA1
   from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, which is also involved in the hypersensitivity
   response. - mxiD from Shigella flexneri which is involved in the secretion of the Ipa invasins
   which are necessary for penetration of intestinal epithelial cells. - omc from Neisseria
   gonorrhoeae. - yssC from Yersinia enterocolitica virulence plasmid pYV, which seems to be
   required for the export of the Yop virulence proteins. - The gpIV protein from filamentous phages
   such as f1, ike, or m13. GpIV is said to be involved in phage assembly and morphogenesis. These

   bound via a amide linkage to a lysine group. The E2 components of OGCD and BCOACD bind a single
   lipoyl group, while those of PDC bind either one (in yeast and in Bacillus), two (in mammals), or
   three (in Azotobacter and in Escherichia coli) lipoyl groups [3]. In addition to the E2
   components of the three enzymatic complexes described above, a lipoic acid cofactor is also found
   in the following proteins: H-protein of the glycine cleavage system (GCS) [4]. GCS is a
   multienzyme complex of four protein components, which catalyzes the degradation of glycine. H
   protein shuttles the methylamine group of glycine from the P protein to the T protein. H-protein
   from either prokaryotes or eukaryotes binds a single lipoic group. Mammalian and yeast pyruvate
   dehydrogenase complexes differ from that of other sources, in that they contain, in small
   amounts, a protein of unknown function - designated protein X or component X. Its sequence is
   closely related to that of E2 subunits and seems to bind a lipoic group [5]. Fast migrating
   protein (FMP) (gene acoC) from Alcaligenes eutrophus [6]. This protein is most probably a
   dihydrolipamide acyltransferase involved in acetoin metabolism. A signature pattern was developed
   which allows the detection of the lipoyl-binding site. Consensus

  <p> 70. C2 (C2 domain) Number of members: 295 </p>
  <p>[0236] Some isozymes of protein kinase C (PKC) [1,2] contain a domain, known as C2, of about
   116 amino-acid residues which is located between the two copies of the C1 domain (that bind
   phorbol esters and diacylglycerol) (see &lt;PDOC00379&gt;) and the protein kinase catalytic
   domain (see &lt;PDOC00100&gt;). Regions with significant homology [3,E1] to the C2-domain have
   been found in the following proteins: PKC isoforms alpha, beta and gamma and Drosophila isoforms
   PKC1 and PKC2. PKC isoforms delta, epsilon and eta, Caenorhabditis elegans kin-13 and yeast PKC1
   have a C2-like domain at the N-terminal extremity [4]. Yeast cAMP dependent protein kinase SCH9
   contains a C2-like domain. Mammalian phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (see
   &lt;PDOC50007&gt;) isoforms beta, gamma and delta as well as several non-mammalian PI-PLCs have a
   C2-like domain C-terminal of the catalytic domain. Mammalian and plants
   phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase have a C2-like domain in the central region of the 110 Kd catalytic
   subunit. Yeast phosphatidylserine-decarboxylase 2 (gene PSD2) contains a C2 domain in its central
   region. Cytosolic phospholipase D from plants and cytosolic phospholipase A2 have a C2-like
   domain at their N-terminus. Synaptotagmins (p65). This is a family of related synaptic vesicle
   proteins that bind acidic phospholipids and that may have a regulatory role in the membrane
   interactions during trafficking of synaptic vesicles at the active zone of the synapse. All
   isoforms of synaptotagmins have two copies of the C2 domain in their C-terminal region.
   Rabphilin-3A, a synaptic protein contains two C2 domains. Caenorhabditis elegans protein unc-13
   whose function is not known. Unc-13 has a C2 domain in its central part and a C2-like domain at
   the C-terminus. rasGAP and the breakpoint cluster protein bcr have a C2-domain C-terminal of a
   PH-domain. Yeast protein BUD2 (or CLA2) has a C2-domain in the central region. Yeast protein RSP5
   and human protein NEDD-4, both proteins also contain WW domains (see &lt;PDOC50020&gt;). Perform
   (see &lt;PDOC00251&gt;) has a C2 domain at the C-terminus. It is the only extracellular protein
   known to contain a C2 domain. Yeast hypothetical protein YML072C has a C2 domain. Yeast
   hypothetical protein YNL087W has three C2 domains. Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein
   F37A4.7 has two C2 domains. The C2 domain is thought to be involved in calcium-dependent
   phospholipid binding [5]. Since domains related to the C2 domain are also found in proteins that
   do not bind calcium, other putative functions for the C2 domain like e.g. binding to
   inositol-1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate have been suggested [6]. Recently, the 3D structure of the first
   C2 domain of synaptotagmin has been reported [7], the domain forms an eight-stranded beta
   sandwich. The signature pattern that has been developed for the C2 domain is located in a
   conserved part of that domain, the connecting loop between beta strands 2 and 3. A profile has
   been developed for the C2 domain that covers the total domain. Consensus pattern:
   [ACG]-x(2)-L-x(2,3)-D-x(1,2)-[NGSTLIF]-[GTMR]-x-[STAP]-D-[PA]-[FY] Note: this documentation entry
   is linked to both a signature pattern and a profile. As the profile is much more sensitive than
   the pattern, you should use it if you have access to the necessary software tools to do so.

  <p> 71. CAP (CAP protein) Number of members: 11 </p>
  <p>[0237] In budding and fission yeasts the CAP protein is a bifunctional protein whose N-terminal
   domain binds to adenylyl cyclase, thereby enabling that enzyme to be activated by upstream
   regulatory signals, such as Ras. The function of the C-terminal domain is less clear, but it is
   required for normal cellular morphology and growth control [1]. CAP is conserved in higher
   eukaryotic organisms where its function is not yet clear [2]. Structurally, CAP is a protein of
   474 to 551 residues which consist of two domains separated by a proline-rich hinge. Two signature
   patterns, one corresponding to a conserved region in the N-terminal extremity and the other to a
   C-terminal region have been developed. Consensus pattern: [LIVM](2)-x-R-L-[DE]-x(4)-R-L-E

  <p>[0239] It has been shown [1] that some cytoskeleton-associated proteins (CAP) share the
   presence of a conserved, glycine-rich domain of about 42 residues, called here CAP-Gly. Proteins
   known to contain this domain are listed below. Restin (also known as cytoplasmic linker
   protein-170 or CLIP-170), a 160 Kd protein associated with intermediate filaments and that links
   endocytic vesicles to microtubules. Restin contains two copies of the CAP-Gly domain. Vertebrate
   dynactin (150 Kd dynein-associated polypeptide; DAP) and Drosophila glued, a major component of
   activator I, a 20S polypeptide complex that stimulates dynein-mediated vesicle transport. Yeast
   protein BIK1 which seems to be required for the formation or stabilization of microtubules during
   mitosis and for spindle pole body fusion during conjugation. Yeast protein NIP100 (NIP80). Human
   protein CKAP1/TFCB, Schizosaccharomyces pombe protein alp11 and Caenorhabditis elegans
   hypothetical protein F53F4.3. These proteins contain a N-terminal ubiquitin domain (see
   &lt;PDOC00271&gt;) and a C-terminal CAP-Gly domain. Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein
   M01A8.2. Yeast hypothetical protein YNL148c. Structurally, these proteins are made of three
   distinct parts: an N-terminal section that is most probably globular and contains the CAP-Gly
   domain, a large central region predicted to be in an alpha-helical coiled-coil conformation and,
   finally, a short C-terminal globular domain. The signature for the CAP-Gly domain corresponds to
   the first 32 residues of the domain and includes five of the six conserved glycines. Consensus

  <p>[0251] Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are protein kinases which associate with cyclins to
   regulate eukaryotic cell cycle progression. The most well known CDK is p34-cdc2 (CDC28 in yeast)
   which is required for entry into S-phase and mitosis. CDK's bind to a regulatory subunit which is
   essential for their biological function. This regulatory subunit is a small protein of 79 to 150
   residues. In yeast (gene CKS1) and in fission yeast (gene suc1) a single isoform is known, while
   mammals have two highly related isoforms. It has been shown [1] that these CDK regulatory
   subunits assemble as an hexamer which then acts as a hub for the oligomerization of six CDK
   catalytic subunits. The sequence of CDK regulatory subunits are highly conserved therefore, the
   two most conserved regions have been used as signature patterns. Consensus pattern:

   acidic residues (see &lt;PDOC00006&gt;). CK-2 exists as an heterotetramer composed of two
   catalytic subunits (alpha) and two regulatory subunits (beta). In most species there are two
   closely related isoforms of the catalytic subunit: alpha and alpha'. Some species, such as fungi
   and plants, express two forms of regulatory subunits: beta and beta'. The exact function of the
   regulatory subunit is not yet known. It is a highly conserved protein of about 25 Kd that
   contains, in its central section, a cysteine-rich motif that could be involved in binding a metal
   such as zinc [2]. This region has been used as a signature pattern. Consensus pattern:

   similar to that of the trypsin family of serine proteases, but which evolved by independent
   convergent evolution. Proteases highly similar to ClpP have been found to be encoded in the
   genome of the chloroplast of plants and seem to be also present in other eukaryotes. The

   (cAMP or cGMP) share a structural domain of about 120 residues [1-3]. The best studied of these
   proteins is the prokaryotic catabolite gene activator (also known as the cAMP receptor protein)
   (gene crp) where such a domain is known to be composed of three alpha-helices and a distinctive
   eight-stranded, antiparallel beta-barrel structure. Such a domain is known to exist in the
   following proteins: Prokaryotic catabolite gene activator protein (CAP). cAMP- and cGMP-dependent
   protein kinases (cAPK and cGPK). Both types of kinases contains two tandem copies of the cyclic
   nucleotide-binding domain. The cAPK's are composed of two different subunits: a catalytic chain
   and a regulatory chain which contains both copies of the domain. The cGPK's are single chain
   enzymes that include the two copies of the domain in their N-terminal section. The nucleotide
   specificity of cAPK and cGPK is due to an amino acid in the conserved region of beta-barrel 7: a
   threonine that is invariant in cGPK is an alanine in most cAPK. Vertebrate cyclic
   nucleotide-gated ion-channels. Two such cations channels have been fully characterized. One is
   found in rod cells where it plays a role in visual signal transduction. It specifically binds to
   cGMP leading to an opening of the channel and thereby causing a depolarization of rod
   photoreceptors. In olfactory epithelium a similar, cAMP-binding, channel plays a role in odorant
   signal transduction. There are six invariant amino acids in this domain, three of which are
   glycine residues that are thought to be essential for maintenance of the structural integrity of
   the beta-barrel. Two signature patterns have been developed for this domain. The first pattern is
   located within beta-barrels and 3 and contains the first two conserved Gly. The second pattern is
   located within beta-barrels 6 and 7 and contains the third conserved Gly as well as the three
   other invariant residues. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0259] Cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) [1] is an oligomeric enzymatic complex which is a
   component of the respiratory chain complex and is involved in the transfer of electrons from
   cytochrome c to oxygen. In eukaryotes this enzyme complex is located in the mitochondrial inner
   membrane; in aerobic prokaryotes it is found in the plasma membrane. In addition to the three
   large subunits that form the catalytic center of the enzyme complex there are, in eukaryotes, a
   variable number of small polypeptidic subunits. One of these subunits which is known as Vb in
   mammals, V in slime mold and IV in yeast, binds a zinc atom. The sequence of subunit Vb is well
   conserved and includes three conserved cysteines that are thought to coordinate the zinc ion [2].
   Two of these cysteines are clustered in the C-terminal section of the subunit; this region has

  <p>[0260] Cholinesterase pages The prints entry is specific to acetylcholinesterase Number of
   members: 273 </p>
  <p>[0261] Higher eukaryotes have many distinct esterases. Among the different types are those
   which act on carboxylic esters (EC 3.1.1.-). Carboxyl-esterases have been classified into three
   categories (A, B and C) on the basis of differential patterns of inhibition by organophosphates.
   The sequence of a number of type-B carboxylesterases indicates [1,2,3] that the majority are
   evolutionary related. This family currently consists of the following proteins:
   Acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) (AChE) [E1] from vertebrates and from Drosophila. Mammalian
   cholinesterase II (butyryl cholinesterase) (EC 3.1.1.8). Acetylcholinesterase and cholinesterase
   II are closely related enzymes that hydrolyze choline esters [4]. Mammalian liver microsomal
   carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1). Drosophila esterase 6, produced in the anterior ejaculatory duct
   of the male insect reproductive system where it plays an important role in its reproductive
   biology. Drosophila esterase P. Culex pipiens (mosquito) esterases B1 and B2. Myzus persicae
   (peach-potato aphid) esterases E4 and FE4. Mammalian bile-salt-activated lipase (BAL) [5], a
   multifunctional lipase which catalyzes fat and vitamin absorption. It is activated by bile salts
   in infant intestine where it helps to digest milk fats. Insect juvenile hormone esterase (JH
   esterase) (EC 3.1.1.59). Lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) from the fungi Geotrichum candidum and Candida
   rugosa. Caenorhabditis gut esterase (gene ges-1). Duck fatty acyl-CoA hydrolase, medium chain (EC
   3.1.2.14), an enzyme that may be associated with peroxisome proliferation and may play a role in
   the production of 3-hydroxy fatty acid diester pheromones. Membrane enclosed crystal proteins
   from slime mold. These proteins are, most probably esterases; the vesicles where they are found
   have therefore been termed esterosomes. </p>
  <p>[0262] So far two bacterial proteins have been found to belong to this family: Phenmedipham
   hydrolase (phenylcarbamate hydrolase), an Arthrobacter oxidans plasmid-encoded enzyme (gene pcd)
   that degrades the phenylcarbamate herbicides phenmedipham and desmedipham by hydrolyzing their
   central carbamate linkages. Para-nitrobenzyl esterase from Bacillus subtilis (gene pnbA). </p>
  <p>[0263] The following proteins, while having lost their catalytic activity, contain a domain
   evolutionary related to that of carboxylesterases type-B: Thyroglobulin (TG), a glycoprotein
   specific to the thyroid gland, which is the precursor of the iodinated thyroid hormones thyroxine
   (T4) and triiodo thyronine (T3). Drosophila protein neuractin (gene nrt) which may mediate or
   modulate cell adhesion between embryonic cells during development. Drosophila protein glutactin
   (gene glt), whose function is not known. </p>
  <p>[0264] As is the case for lipases and serine proteases, the catalytic apparatus of esterases
   involves three residues (catalytic triad): a serine, a glutamate or aspartate and a histidine.
   The sequence around the active site serine is well conserved and can be used as a signature
   pattern. A conserved region located in the N-terminal section containing a cysteine involved in a
   disulfide bond has been selected as a second signature pattern. Consensus pattern:
   F-[GR]-G-x(4)-[LIVM]-x-[LIV]-x-G-x-S-[STAG]-G[S is the active site residue] Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0282] Number of members: 45 </p>
  <p>[0283] Nuclear factor I (NF-I) or CCAAT box-binding transcription factor (CTF) [1,2] (also
   known as TGGCA-binding proteins) are a family of vertebrate nuclear proteins which recognize and
   bind, as dimers, the palindromic DNA sequence 5'-TGGCANNNTGCCA-3'. CTF/NF-I binding sites are
   present in viral and cellular promoters and in the origin of DNA replication of Adenovirus type
   2. </p>
  <p>[0284] The CTF/NF-I proteins were first identified as nuclear factor I, a collection of
   proteins that activate the replication of several Adenovirus serotypes (together with NF-II and
   NF-III) [3]. The family of proteins was also identified as the CTF transcription factors, before
   the NFI and CTF families were found to be identical [4]. The CTF/NF-I proteins are individually
   capable of activating transcription and DNA replication. The CTF/NF-I family name has also been
   dubbed as NFI, NF-I or NF1. </p>
  <p>[0285] In a given species, there are a large number of different CTF/NF-I proteins. </p>
  <p>[0286] The multiplicity of CTF/NF-I is known to be generated both by alternative splicing and
   by the occurrence of four different genes. The known forms of NF-I genes have been classified as:
   The CTF-like factors subfamily (prototype form: CTF-1) [4] The NFI-X proteins. The NFI-A
   proteins. The NFI-B proteins. </p>
  <p>[0287] So far, all CTF/NF-I family members appear to have similar transcription and replication
   activities. </p>
  <p>[0288] CTF/NF-1 proteins contains 400 to 600 amino acids. The N-terminal 200 amino-acid
   sequence, almost perfectly conserved in all species and genes sequenced, mediates site-specific
   DNA recognition, protein dimerization and Adenovirus DNA replication. The C-terminal 100 amino
   acids contain the transcriptional activation domain. This activation domain is the target of gene
   expression regulatory pathways ellicited by growth factors and it interacts with basal
   transcription factors and with histone H3 [6]. </p>
  <p>[0289] A perfectly conserved, highly charged 12 residue peptide located in the N-terminal part
   of CTF/NF-I has been selected as a specific signature for this family of proteins. Consensus

   and skeletal muscle [1], where it is located in the lumenal space of the sarcoplasmic reticulum
   terminal cisternae. Calsequestrin acts as a calcium buffer and plays an important role in the
   muscle excitation-contraction coupling. It is a highly acidic protein of about 400 amino acid
   residues that binds more than 40 moles of calcium per mole of protein. There are at least two
   different forms of calsequestrin: one which is expressed in cardiac muscles and another in
   skeletal muscles. Both forms have highly similar sequences. </p>
  <p>[0292] Two signature sequences have been developed. The first corresponds to the N-terminus of
   the mature protein, the second is located just in front of the C-terminus of the protein which is
   composed of a highly acidic tail of variable length. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0294] Number of members: 146 </p>
  <p>[0295] Chalcone synthases (CHS) (EC 2.3.1.74) and stilbene synthases (STS) (formerly known as
   resveratrol synthases) are related plant enzymes [1]. CHS is an important enzyme in flavanoid
   biosynthesis and STS a key enzyme in stilbene-type phyloalexin biosynthesis. Both enzymes
   catalyze the addition of three molecules of malonyl-CoA to a starter CoA ester (a typical example
   is 4-coumaroyl-CoA), producing either a chalcone (with CHS) or stilbene (with STS). </p>
  <p>[0296] These enzymes are proteins of about 390 amino-acid residues. A conserved cysteine
   residue, located in the central section of these proteins, has been shown [2] to be essential for
   the catalytic activity of both enzymes and probably represents the binding site for the
   4-coumaryl-CoA group. The region around this active site residue is well conserved and can be
   used as a signature pattern. </p>
  <p>[0297] In addition to the plant enzymes, this family also includes Bacillus subtilis bcsA.

  <p>[0298] Number of members: 19 </p>
  <p>[0299] Chorismate synthase (EC 4.6.1.4) catalyzes the last of the seven steps in the shikimate
   pathway which is used in prokaryotes, fungi and plants for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino
   acids. It catalyzes the 1,4-trans elimination of the phosphate group from
   5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) to form chorismate which can then be used in
   phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan biosynthesis. Chorismate synthase requires the presence of
   a reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2 or FADH2) for its activity. </p>
  <p>[0300] Chorismate synthase from various sources shows [1,2] a high degree of sequence
   conservation. It is a protein of about 360 to 400 amino-acid residues. Three signature patterns
   have been developed from conserved regions rich in basic residues (mostly arginines). The first
   is in the N-terminal section, the second is central and the third is C-terminal. Consensus

  <p>[0301] Number of members: 21 </p>
  <p>[0302] Clathrin coated vesicles (CCV) mediate intracellular membrane traffic such as receptor
   mediated endocytosis. In addition to clathrin, the CCV are composed of a number of other
   components including oligomeric complexes which are known as adaptor or clathrin assembly
   proteins (AP) complexes [1]. The adaptor complexes are believed to interact with the cytoplasmic
   tails of membrane proteins, leading to their selection and concentration. In mammals two type of
   adaptor complexes are known: AP-1 which is associated with the Golgi complex and AP-2 which is
   associated with the plasma membrane. Both AP-1 and AP-2 are heterotetramers that consist of two
   large chains - the adaptins - (gamma and beta' in AP-1; alpha and beta in AP-2); a medium chain
   (AP47 in AP-1; AP50 in AP-2) and a small chain (AP19 in AP-1; AP17 in AP-2). </p>
  <p>[0303] The small chains of AP-1 and AP-2 are evolutionary related proteins of about 18 Kd.
   Homologs of AP17 and AP19 have also been found in yeast (genes APS1/YAP19 and APS2/YAP17)
   [2,3,4]. AP17 and AP19 are also related to the zeta-chain [5] of coatomer (zeta-cop), a cytosolic
   protein complex that reversibly associates with Golgi membranes to form vesicles that mediate
   biosynthetic protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum, via the Golgi up to the trans
   Golgi network. </p>

  <p>[0305] Number of members: 8 </p>
  <p>[0306] Clathrin [1,2] is the major coat-forming protein that encloses vesicles such as coated
   pits and forms cell surface patches involved in membrane traffic within eukaryotic cells. The
   clathrin coats (called triskelions) are composed of three heavy chains (180 Kd) and three light
   chains (23 to 27 Kd). </p>
  <p>[0307] The clathrin light chains [3], which may help to properly orient the assembly and
   disassembly of the clathrin coats, bind non-covalently to the heavy chain, they also bind calcium
   and interact with the hsc70 uncoating ATPase. In higher eukaryotes two genes code for distinct
   but related light chains: LC(a) and LC(b). Each of the two genes can yield, by tissue-specific
   alternative splicing, two separate forms which differ by the insertion of a sequence of
   respectively thirty or eighteen residues. There is, in the N-terminal part of the clathrin light
   chains a domain of twenty one amino acid residues which is perfectly conserved in LC(a) and
   LC(b). In yeast there is a single light chain (gene CLC1) whose sequence is only distantly
   related to that of higher eukaryotes. </p>
  <p>[0308] Two signature patterns have been developed for clathrin light chains. The first pattern
   is a heptapeptide from the center of the conserved N-terminal region of eukaryotic light chains;
   the second pattern is derived from a positively charged region located in the C-terminal
   extremity of all known clathrin light chains. Consensus pattern: F-L-A-Q-Q-E-S [ 1] <ref type="npl">Keen J.H.

   and third positions can be any residue but are frequently proline and hydroxyproline. Collagens
   are post translationally modified by proline hydoxylase to form the hydroxyproline residues.

   Number of members: 150 </p>
  <p>[0315] Multicopper oxidases [1,2] are enzymes that possess three spectroscopically different
   copper centers. These centers are called: type 1 (or blue), type 2 (or normal) and type 3 (or
   coupled binuclear). The enzymes that belong to this family are: Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) (urishiol
   oxidase), an enzyme found in fungi and plants, which oxidizes many different types of phenols and
   diamines. Ascorbate oxidase (EC 1.10.3.3), a higher plant enzyme. Ceruloplasmin (EC 1.16.3.1)
   (ferroxidase), a protein found in the serum of mammals and birds, which oxidizes a great variety
   of inorganic and organic substances. Structurally ceruloplasmin exhibits internal sequence
   homology, and seem to have evolved from the triplication of a copper-binding domain similar to
   that found in laccase and ascorbate oxidase. </p>
  <p>[0316] In addition to the above enzymes there are a number of proteins which, on the basis of
   sequence similarities, can be said to belong to this family. These proteins are: Copper
   resistance protein A (copA) from a plasmid in Pseudomonas syringae. This protein seems to be
   involved in the resistance of the microbial host to copper. Blood coagulation factor V (Fa V).
   Blood coagulation factor VIII (Fa VIII) [E1]. Yeast FET3 [3], which is required for ferrous iron
   uptake. Yeast hypothetical protein YFL041w and SpAC1F7.08, the fission yeast homolog. </p>
  <p>[0317] Factors V and VIII act as cofactors in blood coagulation and are structurally similar
   [4]. Their sequence consists of a triplicated A domain, a B domain and a duplicated C domain; in
   the following order: A-A-B-A-C-C. The A-type domain is related to the multicopper oxidases. </p>
  <p>[0318] Two signature patterns have been developed for these proteins. Both patterns are derived
   from the same region, which in ascorbate oxidase, laccase, in the third domain of ceruloplasmin,
   and in copA, contains five residues that are known to be involved in the binding of copper
   centers. The first pattern does not make any assumption on the presence of copper-binding
   residues and thus can detect domains that have lost the ability to bind copper (such as those in
   Fa V and Fa VIII), while the second pattern is specific to copper-binding domains. Consensus

   profile Proteins that bind cyclic nucleotides (cAMP or cGMP) share a structural domainof about
   120 residues [1-3]. The best studied of these proteins is theprokaryotic catabolite gene
   activator (also known as the cAMP receptorprotein) (gene crp) where such a domain is known to be
   composed of threealpha-helices and a distinctive eight-stranded, antiparallel
   beta-barrelstructure. Such a domain is known to exist in the following proteins: - Prokaryotic
   catabolite gene activator protein (CAP). - cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cAPK and
   cGPK). Both types of kinases contains two tandem copies of the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain.
   The cAPK's are composed of two different subunits: a catalytic chain and a regulatory chain which
   contains both copies of the domain. The cGPK's are single chain enzymes that include the two
   copies of the domain in their N- terminal section. The nucleotide specificity of cAPK and cGPK is
   due to an amino acid in the conserved region of beta-barrel 7: a threonine that is invariant in
   cGPK is an alanine in most cAPK. - Vertebrate cyclic nucleotide-gated ion-channels. Two such
   cations channels have been fully characterized. One is found in rod cells where it plays a role
   in visual signal transduction. It specifically binds to cGMP leading to an opening of the channel
   and thereby causing a depolarization of rod photoreceptors. In olfactory epithelium a similar,
   cAMP-binding, channel plays a role in odorant signal transduction. There are six invariant amino
   acids in this domain, three of which are glycine residues that are thought to be essential for
   maintenance of the of the beta-barrel. Two signature patterns for this domain have been
   developed. The first pattern is located within beta-barrels 2 and 3 and contains the first two
   conserved Gly. The second pattern is located within beta-barrels 6 and 7 and contains the third
   conserved Gly as well as the three other invariant residues.- First consensus pattern:

  <p> 109. (cadherin) </p>
  <p> Cadherins extracellular repeated domain signature </p>
  <p>[0340] Cadherins [1,2] are a family of animal glycoproteins responsible for calcium-dependent
   cell-cell adhesion. Cadherins preferentially interact with themselves in a homophilic manner in
   connecting cells; thus acting as both receptor and ligand. A wide number of tissue-specific forms
   of cadherins are known: Epithelial (E-cadherin) (also known as uvomorulin or L-CAM) (CDH1).
   Neural (N-cadherin) (CDH2). Placental (P-cadherin) (CDH3). Retinal (R-cadherin) (CDH4). Vascular
   endothelial (VE-cadherin) (CDH5). Kidney (K-cadherin) (CDH6). Cadherin-8 (CDH8). Osteoblast
   (OB-cadherin) (CDH11). Brain (BR-cadherin) (CDH12). T-cadherin (truncated cadherin) (CDH13).
   Muscle (M-cadherin) (CDH14). Liver-intestine (LI-cadherin). EP-cadherin. </p>
  <p>[0341] Structurally, cadherins are built of the following domains: a signal sequence, followed
   by a propeptide of about 130 residues, then an extracellular domain of around 600 residues, then
   a transmembrane region, and finally a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of about 150 residues. The
   extracellular domain can be sub- divided into five parts: there are four repeats of about 110
   residues followed by a region that contains four conserved cysteines. It is suggested that the
   calcium-binding region of cadherins is located in the extracellular repeats. </p>
  <p>[0342] Cadherins are evolutionary related to the desmogleins which are component of
   intercellular desmosome junctions involved in the interaction of plaque proteins: Desmoglein 1
   (desmosomal glycoprotein I). Desmoglein 2. Desmoglein 3 (Pemphigus vulgaris antigen). </p>
  <p>[0343] The Drosophila fat protein [3] is a huge protein of over 5000 amino acids that contains
   34 cadherin-like repeats in its extracellular domain. </p>
  <p>[0344] The signature pattern that was developed for the repeated domain is located in it the
   C-terminal extremity which is its best conserved region. The pattern includes two conserved
   aspartic acid residues as well as two asparagines; these residues could be implicated in the
   binding of calcium. </p>

  <p> 110. Calreticulin family signatures </p>
  <p>[0346] Calreticulin [1] (also known as calregulin, CRP55 or HACBP) is a
   high-capacitycalcium-binding protein which is present in most tissues and located at the
   periphery of the endoplasmic (ER) and the sarcoplamic reticulum (SR)membranes. It probably plays
   a role in the storage of calcium in the lumen ofthe ER and SR and it may well have other
   important functions. Structurally, calreticulin is a protein of about 400 amino acid residues
   consisting of three domains: a) An N-terminal, probably globular, domain of about 180 amino acid
   residues (N-domain); b) A central domain of about 70 residues (P-domain) which contains three
   repeats of an acidic 17 amino acid motif. This region binds calcium with a low-capacity, but a
   high-affinity; c) A C-terminal domain rich in acidic residues and in lysine (C-domain). This
   region binds calcium with a high-capacity but a low-affinity. Calreticulin is evolutionary
   related to the following proteins: - Onchocerca volvulus antigen RAL-1. RAL-1 is highly similar
   to calreticulin, but possesses a C-terminal domain rich in lysine and arginine and lacks acidic
   residues and is therefore not expected to bind calcium in that region. - Calnexin [2]. A
   calcium-binding protein that interacts with newly synthesized glycoproteins in the endoplasmic
   reticulum. It seems to play a major role in the quality control apparatus of the ER by the
   retention of incorrectly folded proteins. - Calmegin [3] (or calnexin-T), a testis-specific
   calcium-binding protein highly similar to calnexin. Three signature patterns have been developed
   for this family of proteins. The first two patterns are based on conserved regions in the
   N-domain; the third pattern corresponds to positions 4 to 16 of the repeated motif in the
   P-domain. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 111. Eukaryotic-type carbonic anhydrases signature (carb_anhydrase) </p>
  <p>[0347] Carbonic anhydrases (EC 4.2.1.1) (CA) [1,2,3,4] are zinc metalloenzymes which catalyze
   the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. Eight enzymatic and evolutionary related forms of
   carbonic anhydrase are currently known to exist in vertebrates: three cytosolic isozymes (CA-I,
   CA-II and CA-III); two membrane-bound forms (CA-IV and CA-VII); a mitochondrial form (CA-V); a
   secreted salivary form (CA-VI); and a yet uncharacterized isozyme [5].In the alga Chlamydomonas
   reinhardtii, two CA isozymes have been sequenced[6]. They are periplasmic glycoproteins
   evolutionary related to vertebrate CAs. Some bacteria, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae [7] also
   have a eukaryotic-type CA.CAs contain a single zinc atom bound to three conserved histidine
   residues. As a signature for CAs, a pattern has been developed which includes one of these
   zinc-binding histidines. Protein D8 from Vaccinia and other poxviruses is related to CAs but has
   lost two of the zinc-binding histidines as well as many otherwise conserved residues. This is
   also true of the N-terminal extracellular domain of some receptor-type tyrosine-protein
   phosphatases (see &lt;PDOC00323&gt;). Consensus pattern:

  <p> 112. Caseins alpha/beta signature </p>
  <p>[0348] Caseins [1] are the major protein constituent of milk. Caseins can be classified into

   alpha-s2, and beta-caseins. The alpha/beta caseins are a rapidly diverging family of proteins.
   However two regions are conserved: a cluster of phosphorylated serine residues and the signal
   sequence. The signature pattern has been developed for this family of proteins based upon the
   last eight residues of the signal sequence. Consensus pattern: C-L-[LV]-A-x-A-[LVF]-A - [ 1] <ref type="npl">Holt

  <p>[0349] Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) [1,2,3] is an enzyme, present in all aerobic cells,that
   decomposes hydrogen peroxide to molecular oxygen and water. Its main function is to protect cells
   from the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide. In eukaryotic organisms and in some prokaryotes
   catalase is a molecule composed of four identical subunits. Each of the subunits binds one
   protoheme IX group. A conserved tyrosine serves as the heme proximal side ligand. The region
   around this residue has been used as a first signature pattern; it also includes a conserved
   arginine that participates in heme-binding. A conserved histidine has been shown to be important
   for the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. The region around this residue has been selected as a
   second signature pattern.- Consensus pattern: R-[LIVMFSTAN]-F-[GASTNP]-Y-x-D-[AST]-[QEH] [Y is

  <p> 114. (chitin binding) Chitin recognition or binding domain signature </p>
  <p>[0350] A conserved domain of 43 amino acids is found in several plant and fungal proteins that
   have a common binding specificity for oligosaccharides of N-acetylglucosamine [1]. This domain
   may be involved in the recognition or binding of chitin subunits. It has been found in the
   proteins listed below. - A number of non-leguminous plant lectins. The best characterized of
   these lectins are the three highly homologous wheat germ agglutinins (WGA-1, 2 and 3). WGA is an
   N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylneuraminic acid binding lectin which structurally consists of a
   fourfold repetition of the 43 amino acid domain. The same type of structure is found in a barley
   root-specific lectin as well as a rice lectin. - Plants endochitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) from class
   IA (see &lt;PDOC00620&gt;). Endochitinases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the
   beta-1,4 linkages of N-acetyl glucosamine polymers of chitin. Plant chitinases function as a
   defense against chitin containing fungal pathogens. Class IA chitinases generally contain one
   copy of the chitin-binding domain at their N-terminal extremity. An exception is
   agglutinin/chitinase [2] from the stinging nettle Urtica dioica which contains two copies of the
   domain. - Hevein [5], a wound-induced protein found in the latex of rubber trees. - Winl and
   win2, two wound-induced proteins from potato. - Kluyveromyces lactis killer toxin alpha subunit
   [3]. The toxin encoded by the linear plasmid pGKL1 is composed of three subunits: alpha, beta,
   and gamma. The gamma subunit harbors toxin activity and inhibits growth of sensitive yeast
   strains in the G1 phase of the cell cycle; the alpha subunit, which is proteolytically processed
   from a larger precursor that also contains the beta subunit, is a chitinase (see
   &lt;PDOC00839&gt;). In chitinases, as well as in the potato wound-induced proteins, the
   43-residuedomain directly follows the signal sequence and is therefore at the N-terminal of the
   mature protein; in the killer toxin alpha subunit it is located in the central section of the
   protein. The domain contains eight conserved cysteine residues which have all been shown, in WGA,
   to be involved in disulfide bonds. The topological arrangement of the four disulfide bonds is
   shown in the following figure:

  <p> 115. (Chitinase 1) Chitinases family 19 signatures </p>
  <p>[0351] Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) [1] are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of
   thebeta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine linkages in chitin polymers. From the viewpoint of sequence
   similarity chitinases belong to either family 18 or 19 in the classification of glycosyl
   hydrolases [2,E1]. Chitinases of family 19(also known as classes IA or I and IB or II) are
   enzymes from plants that function in the defense against fungal and insect pathogens by
   destroying their chitin-containing cell wall. Class IA/I and IB/II enzymes differ in the presence
   (IA/I) or absence (IB/II) of a N-terminal chitin-binding domain (seethe relevant entry
   &lt;PDOC00025&gt;). The catalytic domain of these enzymes consist of about 220 to 230 amino acid
   residues. Two highly conserved regions have been selected as signature patterns, the first one is
   located in the N-terminal section and contains one of the six cysteines which are conserved in
   most, if not all, of these chitinases and which is probably involved in a disulfide bond.

   chromo domain seem to fall into three classes: a) Proteins which have a N-terminal chromo domain
   followed by a region which is related to but distinct from the chromo domain and which has been
   termed [3] the 'chromo shadow' domain. b) Proteins with a single chromo domain. c) Proteins with
   paired tandem chromo domains. </p>
  <p>[0354] Currently, this domain has been found in the following proteins: Class A. Drosophila
   heterochromatin protein Su(var)205 (HP1). Human heterochromatin protein HP1 alpha. Mammalian
   modifier 1 and modifier 2. Fission yeast swi6, a protein involved in the repression of the silent
   mating-type loci mat2 and mat3. Class B. Drosophila protein Polycomb (Pc). Mammalian modifier 3,
   a homolog of Pc. Drosophila protein Su(var)3-9, a suppressor of position-effect variegation.
   Human Mi-2 autoantigen, characterisitic of dermatomyosis. Fungal retrotranposon polyproteins:
   'skippy' from Fusarium oxysporum, 'grasshopper' and 'MAGGY' from Magnaporthe grisea and CfT-1

  <p>[0356] Citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7) (CS) is the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme that catalyzes
   the synthesis of citrate from oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA in an aldol condensation. CS can
   directly form a carbon-carbon bond in the absence of metal ion cofactors. </p>
  <p>[0357] In prokaryotes, citrate synthase is composed of six identical subunits. In eukaryotes,
   there are two isozymes of citrate synthase: one is found in the mitochondrial matrix, the second
   is cytoplasmic. Both seem to be dimers of identical chains. </p>
  <p>[0358] There are a number of regions of sequence similarity between prokaryotic and eukaryotic
   citrate synthases. One of the best conserved contains a histidine which is one of three residues
   shown [1] to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of the vertebrate mitochondrial enzyme. This
   region has been used as a signature pattern. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0360] A number of ATP-binding proteins that are are thought to protect cells from extreme
   stress by controlling the aggregation of denaturation of vital cellular structures have been
   shown [1,2] to be evolutionary related. These proteins are listed below. Escherichia coli clpA,
   which acts as the regulatory subunit of the ATP-dependent protease clp. Rhodopseudomonas blastica
   clpA homolog. Escherichia coli heat shock protein clpB and homologs in other bacteria. Bacillus
   subtilis protein mecB. Yeast heat shock protein 104 (gene HSP104), which is vital for tolerance
   to heat, ethanol and other stresses. Neurospora heat shock protein hsp98. Yeast mitochondrial

   seem to be located in the chloroplast. Trypanosoma brucei protein clp. Porphyra purpurea
   chloroplast encoded clpC. </p>
  <p>[0361] The size of these proteins range from 84 Kd (clpA) to slightly more than 100 Kd
   (HSP104). They all share two conserved regions of about 200 amino acids that each contains an
   ATP-binding site. In addition to the ATP-binding A and B motifs there are many parts in these two
   domains that are also conserved. Two of these regions have been selected as signature patterns.
   The first signature is located in the first domain, some ten residues to the C-terminal of the
   ATP-binding B motif. The second pattern is located in the second domain in-between the
   ATP-binding A and B motifs. Consensus pattern: D-[AI]-[SGA]-N-[LIVMF](2)-K-[PT]-x-L-x(2)-G

  <p>[0365] Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.5.3) [1,2] (also known as complexl or
   NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is an oligomeric enzymatic complex located in the inner
   mitochondrial membrane which also seems to exist inthe chloroplast and in cyanobacteria (as a
   NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase).Among the 25 to 30 polypeptide subunits of this bioenergetic
   enzyme complex there is one with a molecular weight of 24 Kd (in mammals), which is a component
   of the iron-sulfur (IP) fragment of the enzyme. It seems to bind a2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster. The
   24 Kd subunit is nuclear encoded, as aprecursor form with a transit peptide in mammals, and in
   Neurospora crassa.The 24 Kd subunit is highly similar to [3,4]: - Subunit E of Escherichia coli
   NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (gene nuoE). - Subunit NQO2 of Paracoccus denitrificans
   NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase. A highly conserved region, located in the central section of this
   subunit containing two conserved cysteines that are probably involved in the binding of the
   2Fe-2S center has been selected as a signature pattern. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 122. copper-bind </p>
  <p>[0366] Copper binding proteins, plastocyanin/azurin family Number of members: 70 Blue or
   'type-1' copper proteins are small proteins which bind a single copper atom and which are
   characterized by an intense electronic absorption band near 600 nm [1,2]. The most well known
   members of this class of proteins are the plant chloroplastic plastocyanins, which exchange
   electrons with cytochrome c6, and the distantly related bacterial azurins, which exchange
   electrons with cytochrome c551. This family of proteins also includes all the proteins listed
   below (references are only provided for recently determined sequences). Amicyanin from bacteria
   such as Methylobacterium extorquens or Thiobacillus versutus that can grow on methylamine.
   Amicyanin appears to be an electron receptor for methylamine dehydrogenase. Auracyanins A and B
   from Chloroflexus aurantiacus [3]. These proteins can donate electrons to cytochrome c-554. Blue
   copper protein from Alcaligenes faecalis. Cupredoxin (CPC) from cucumber peelings [4]. Cusacyanin
   (basic blue protein; plantacyanin, CBP) from cucumber. Halocyanin from Natrobacterium pharaonis
   [5], a membrane associated copper-binding protein. Pseudoazurin from Pseudomonas. Rusticyanin
   from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. Rusticyanin is an electron carrier from cytochrome c-552 to the
   a-type oxidase [6]. Stellacyanin from the Japanese lacquer tree. Umecyanin from horseradish
   roots. Allergen Ra3 from ragweed. This pollen protein is evolutionary related to the above
   proteins, but seems to have lost the ability to bind copper. </p>
  <p>[0367] Although there is an appreciable amount of divergence in the sequence of all these
   proteins, the copper ligand sites are conserved and a pattern which includes two of the ligands
   (a cysteine and a histidine) has been developed. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 123. Chaperonins cpn10 signature </p>
  <p>[0368] Chaperonins [1,2] are proteins involved in the folding of proteins or the assembly of
   oligomeric protein complexes. They seem to assist other polypeptides in maintaining or assuming
   conformations which permit their correct assembly into oligomeric structures. They are found in
   abundance in prokaryotes, chloroplasts and mitochondria. Chaperonins form oligomeric complexes
   and are composed of two different types of subunits: a 60 Kd protein, known as cpn60 (groEL in
   bacteria) and a 10 Kd protein, known ascpn10 (groES in bacteria).The cpn10 protein binds to cpn60
   in the presence of MgATP and suppresses the ATPase activity of the latter. Cpn10 is a protein of
   about 100 amino acid residues whose sequence is well conserved in bacteria, vertebrate
   mitochondriaand plants chloroplast [3,4]. Cpn10 assembles as an heptamer that forms a dome[5]. As
   a signature pattern for cpn10, a region located in the N-terminal section of the protein was
   selected. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 124. Chaperonins cpn60 signature (cpn60_TCP1) </p>
  <p>[0369] Chaperonins [1,2] are proteins involved in the folding of proteins or the assembly of
   oligomeric protein complexes. Their role seems to be to assist other polypeptides to maintain or
   assume conformations which permit their correct assembly into oligomeric structures. They are
   found in abundance in prokaryotes, chloroplasts and mitochondria. Chaperonins form oligomeric
   complexes and are composed of two different types of subunits: a 60 Kd protein, known as cpn60
   (groEL in bacteria) and a 10 Kd protein, known as cpn10 (groES in bacteria).The cpn60 protein
   shows weak ATPase activity and is a highly conserved protein of about 550 to 580 amino acid
   residues which has been described by different names in different species: - Escherichia coli
   groEL protein, which is essential for the growth of the bacteria and the assembly of several
   bacteriophages. - Cyanobacterial groEL analogues. - Mycobacterium tuberculosis and leprae 65 Kd
   antigen, Coxiella burnetti heat shock protein B (gene htpB), Rickettsia tsutsugamushi major
   antigen 58, and Chlamydial 57 Kd hypersensitivity antigen (gene hypB). - Chloroplast RuBisCO
   subunit binding-protein alpha and beta chains, which bind ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small
   and large subunits and are implicated in the assembly of the enzyme oligomer. - Mammalian
   mitochondrial matrix protein P1 (mitonin or P60). - Yeast HSP60 protein, a mitochondrial assembly
   factor. As a signature pattern for these proteins, a rather well-conserved region of twelve
   residues, located in the last third of the cpn60sequence was chosen. Consensus pattern:

  <p> Chaperonins TCP-1 signatures (cpn60_TCP1) </p>
  <p>[0370] The TCP-1 protein [1,2] (Tailless Complex Polypeptide 1) was first identified in mice
   where it is especially abundant in testis but present in all cell types. It has since been found
   and characterized in many other mammalian species, in Drosophila and in yeast. TCP-1 is a highly
   conserved protein of about 60 Kd (556 to 560 residues) which participates in a
   hetero-oligomeric900 Kd double-torus shaped particle [3] with 6 to 8 other different subunits.
   These subunits, the chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT) subunit beta, gamma,delta, epsilon, zeta
   and eta are evolutionary related to TCP-1 itself [4,5].The CCT is known to act as a molecular
   chaperone for tubulin, actin and probably some other proteins. The CCT subunits are highly
   related to archebacterial counterparts: - TF55 and TF56 [6], a molecular chaperone from
   Sulfolobus shibatae. TF55 has ATPase activity, is known to bind unfolded polypeptides and forms a
   oligomeric complex of two stacked nine-membered rings. - Thermosome [7], from Thermoplasma
   acidophilum. The thermosome is composed of two subunits (alpha and beta) and also seems to be a
   chaperone with ATPase activity. It forms an oligomeric complex of eight-membered rings. The TCP-1
   family of proteins are weakly, but significantly [8], related to thecpn60/groEL chaperonin family
   (see &lt;PDOC00268&gt;).As signature patterns of this family of chaperonins, three conserved

  <p>[0378] They are the precursor of the active peptide bradykinin and play a role in blood

   are also inhibitors of cysteine proteases. Structurally, kininogens are made of three contiguous

  <p> 131. DEAD and DEAH box families ATP-dependent helicases signatures </p>
  <p>[0386] A number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins have been characterized [1,2,3] on the
   basis of their structural similarity. They all seem to be involved in ATP-dependent, nucleic-acid
   unwinding. Proteins currently known to belong to this family are: - Initiation factor eIF-4A.
   Found in eukaryotes, this protein is a subunit of a high molecular weight complex involved in
   5'cap recognition and the binding of mRNA to ribosomes. It is an ATP-dependent RNA-helicase. -
   PRP5 and PRP28. These yeast proteins are involved in various ATP-requiring steps of the pre-mRNA
   splicing process. - P110, a mouse protein expressed specifically during spermatogenesis. - An3, a
   Xenopus putative RNA helicase, closely related to P110. - SPP81/DED1 and DBP1, two yeast proteins
   probably involved in pre-mRNA splicing and related to Pl10. - Caenorhabditis elegans helicase
   glh-1. - MSS116, a yeast protein required for mitochondrial splicing. - SPB4, a yeast protein
   involved in the maturation of 25S ribosomal RNA. - p68, a human nuclear antigen. p68 has ATPase
   and DNA-helicase activities in vitro. It is involved in cell growth and division. - Rm62 (p62), a
   Drosophila putative RNA helicase related to p68. - DBP2, a yeast protein related to p68. - DHH1,
   a yeast protein. - DRS1, a yeast protein involved in ribosome assembly. - MAK5, a yeast protein
   involved in maintenance of dsRNA killer plasmid. - ROK1, a yeast protein. - ste13, a fission
   yeast protein. - Vasa, a Drosophila protein important for oocyte formation and specification of
   embryonic posterior structures. - Me31B, a Drosophila maternally expressed protein of unknown
   function. - dbpA, an Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase. - deaD, an Escherichia coli putative
   RNA helicase which can suppress a mutation in the rpsB gene for ribosomal protein S2. - rhlB, an
   Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase. - rhlE, an Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase. -
   srmB, an Escherichia coli protein that shows RNA-dependent ATPase activity. It probably interacts
   with 23S ribosomal RNA. - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins T26G10.1, ZK512.2 and
   ZK686.2. - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR065c. - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR169w. - Fission
   yeast hypothetical protein SpAC31A2.07c. - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yxiN. All these
   proteins share a number of conserved sequence motifs. Some of them are specific to this family
   while others are shared by other ATP-binding proteins or by proteins belonging to the helicases
   'superfamily' [4,E1]. One of these motifs, called the 'D-E-A-D-box', represents a special version
   of the B motif of ATP-binding proteins. Some other proteins belong to a subfamily which have His
   instead of the second Asp and are thus said to be 'D-E-A-H-box' proteins [3,5,6,E1]. Proteins
   currently known to belong to this subfamily are: - PRP2, PRP16, PRP22 and PRP43. These yeast
   proteins are all involved in various ATP-requiring steps of the pre-mRNA splicing process. -
   Fission yeast prh1, which my be involved in pre-mRNA splicing. - Male-less (mle), a Drosophila
   protein required in males, for dosage compensation of X chromosome linked genes. - RAD3 from
   yeast. RAD3 is a DNA helicase involved in excision repair of DNA damaged by UV light, bulky
   adducts or cross-linking agents. Fission yeast rad15 (rhp3) and mammalian DNA excision repair
   protein XPD (ERCC-2) are the homologs of RAD3. - Yeast CHL1 (or CTF1), which is important for
   chromosome transmission and normal cell cycle progression in G(2)/M. - Yeast TPS1. - Yeast
   hypothetical protein YKL078w. - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C06E1.10 and
   K03H1.2. - Poxviruses' early transcription factor 70 Kd subunit which acts with RNA polymerase to
   initiate transcription from early gene promoters. - I8, a putative vaccinia virus helicase. -
   hrpA, an Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase. Signature patterns for both subfamilies were
   developed. Consensus pattern: [LIVMF](2)-D-E-A-D-[RKEN]-x-[LIVMFYGSTN Consensus pattern:

   chloroplast and in many bacteria (gene dapA), the first reaction specific to the biosynthesis of
   lysine and of diaminopimelate. DHDPS is responsible for the condensation of aspartate
   semialdehyde and pyruvate by aping-pong mechanism in which pyruvate first binds to the enzyme by
   forming a Schiff-base with a lysine residue. Three other proteins are structurally related to
   DHDPS and probably also act via a similar catalytic mechanism: - Escherichia coli
   N-acetylneuraminate lyase (EC 4.1.3.3) (gene nanA), which catalyzes the condensation of
   N-acetyl-D-mannosamine and pyruvate to form N-acetylneuraminate. - Rhizobium meliloti protein
   mosA [3], which is involved in the biosynthesis of the rhizopine 3-o-methyl-scyllo-inosamine. -
   Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjhH. Two signature patterns for these enzymes were
   developed . The first one is centered on highly conserved region in the N-terminal part of these
   proteins. The second signature contains a lysine residue which has been shown, in Escherichia
   coli dapA [2], to be the one that forms a Schiff-base with the substrate. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0390] Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.3.1) (DHOdehase) catalyzes the fourth step in the
   de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine, the conversion of dihydroorotate into orotate. DHOdehase is a
   ubiquitous FAD flavoprotein. In bacteria (gene pyrD), DHOdease is located on the inner side of
   the cytosolic membrane. In some yeasts, such as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (gene URA1), it is a
   cytosolic protein while in other eukaryotes it is found in the mitochondria [1]. The sequence of
   DHOdease is rather well conserved and two signature patterns were developed specific to this
   enzyme. The first corresponds to a region in the N-terminal section of the enzyme while the
   second is located in the C-terminal section and seems to be part of the FAD-binding domain.

   specifically methylate the C-5 carbon of cytosines in DNA [1,2,3]. Such enzymes are found in the
   proteins described below. - As a component of type II restriction-modification systems in
   prokaryotes and some bacteriophages. Such enzymes recognize a specific DNA sequence where they

   known. - In vertebrates, there are a number of C-5 Mtases that methylate CpG dinucleotides. The
   sequence of the mammalian enzyme is known.C-5 Mtases share a number of short conserved regions.
   Two of them were selected. The first is centered around a conserved Pro-Cys dipeptide in which
   the cysteine has been shown [4] to be involved in the catalytic mechanism; it appears to form a

   enzyme. It binds to UV-damaged DNA containing pyrimidine dimers and, upon absorbing a near-UV
   photon (300 to 500 nm), breaks the cyclobutane ring joining the two pyrimidines of the dimer. DNA
   photolyase is an enzyme that requires two choromophore-cofactors for its activity: a reduced

   have been grouped together [1,2,3] under the designation of DNA polymerase family A. The
   polymerases that belong to this family are listed below. Escherichia coli and various other
   bacterial polymerase I (gene polA). Thermus aquaticus Taq polymerase. Bacteriophage sp01

   conserved regions, known as 'motif B' [1], is located in a domain which, in Escherichia coli
   polA, has been shown to bind deoxynucleotide triphosphate substrates; it contains a conserved
   tyrosine which has been shown, by photo- affinity labelling, to be in the active site; a

  <p> DNA topoisomerase II signature </p>
  <p>[0397] DNA topoisomerase I (EC 5.99.1.2) [1,2,3,4,E1] is one of the two types of enzyme that
   catalyze the interconversion of topological DNA isomers. Type II topoisomerases are ATP-dependent
   and act by passing a DNA segment through a transient double-strand break. Topoisomerase II is
   found in phages, archaebacteria, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and in African Swine Fever virus (ASF).
   In bacteriophage T4 topoisomerase II consists of three subunits (the product of genes 39, 52 and
   60). In prokaryotes and in archaebacteria the enzyme, known as DNA gyrase, consists of two
   subunits (genes gyrA and gyrB [E2]). In some bacteria, a second type II topoisomerase has been
   identified; it is known as topoisomerase IV and is required for chromosome segregation, it also
   consists of two subunits (genes parC and parE). In eukaryotes, type II topoisomerase is a
   homodimer. </p>
  <p>[0398] There are many regions of sequence homology between the different subtypes of
   topoisomerase II. The relation between the different subunits is shown in the following
   representation: EMI173.1 </p>
  <p>[0399] As a signature pattern for this family of proteins, a region that contains a highly

  <p> 141. (DSPc) Tyrosine specific protein phosphatases signature and profiles </p>
  <p>[0401] Tyrosine specific protein phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.48) (PTPase) [1 to 5] are enzymes that
   catalyze the removal of a phosphate group attached to a tyrosine residue. These enzymes are very
   important in the control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and transformation.
   Multiple forms of PTPase have been characterized and can be classified into two categories:
   soluble PTPases and transmembrane receptor proteins that contain PTPase domain(s). The currently
   known PTPases are listed below: Soluble PTPases. - PTPN1 (PTP-1B). - PTPN2 (T-cell PTPase;
   TC-PTP). - PTPN3 (H1) and PTPN4 (MEG), enzymes that contain an N-terminal band 4.1- like domain
   (see &lt;PDOC00566&gt;) and could act at junctions between the membrane and cytoskeleton. - PTPN5
   (STEP). - PTPN6 (PTP-1C; HCP; SHP) and PTPN11 (PTP-2C; SH-PTP3; Syp), enzymes which contain two
   copies of the SH2 domain at its N-terminal extremity. The Drosophila protein corkscrew (gene csw)
   also belongs to this subgroup. - PTPN7 (LC-PTP; Hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase;
   HePTP). - PTPN8 (70Z-PEP). - PTPN9 (MEG2). - PTPN12 (PTP-G1; PTP-P19). - Yeast PTP1. - Yeast PTP2
   which may be involved in the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway. - Fission yeast pyp1
   and pyp2 which play a role in inhibiting the onset of mitosis. - Fission yeast pyp3 which
   contributes to the dephosphorylation of cdc2.- Yeast CDC14 which may be involved in chromosome
   segregation. - Yersinia virulence plasmid PTPAses (gene yopH). - Autographa californica nuclear
   polyhedrosis virus 19 Kd PTPase.Dual specificity PTPases. - DUSP1 (PTPN10; MAP kinase
   phosphatase-1; MKP-1); which dephosphorylates MAP kinase on both Thr-183 and Tyr-185. - DUSP2
   (PAC-1), a nuclear enzyme that dephosphorylates MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 on both Thr and Tyr
   residues. - DUSP3 (VHR). - DUSP4 (HVH2). - DUSP5 (HVH3). - DUSP6 (Pystl; MKP-3). - DUSP7 (Pyst2:
   MKP-X). - Yeast MSG5, a PTPase that dephosphorylates MAP kinase FUS3. - Yeast YVH1. - Vaccinia
   virus H1 PTPase; a dual specificity phosphatase. Receptor PTPases. Structurally, all known
   receptor PTPases, are made up of a variable length extracellular domain, followed by a
   transmembrane region and a C-terminalcatalytic cytoplasmic domain. Some of the receptor PTPases
   contain fibronectintype III (FN-III) repeats, immunoglobulin-like domains, MAM domains orcarbonic
   anhydrase-like domains in their extracellular region. The cytoplasmic region generally contains
   two copies of the PTPAse domain. The first seems to have enzymatic activity, while the second is
   inactive but seems to affect substrate specificity of the first. In these domains, the catalytic
   cysteine is generally conserved but some other, presumably important, residues are not. In the
   following table, the domain structure of known receptor PTPases is shown: Extracellular
   Intracellular -------------------------------- Ig FN-3 CAH MAM PTPaseLeukocyte common antigen

   2PTPase domains consist of about 300 amino acids. There are two conserved cysteines, the second
   one has been shown to be absolutely required for activity. Furthermore, a number of conserved
   residues in its immediate vicinity have also been shown to be important. A signature pattern for
   PTPase domains was derived centered on the active site cysteine. There are three profiles for
   PTPases, the first one spans the complete domain and is not specific to any subtype. The second
   profile is specific to dual-specificity PTPases and the third one to the PTP subfamily Consensus

  <p> 149. (Desaturase) Fatty acid desaturases signatures </p>
  <p>[0409] Fatty acid desaturases (EC 1.14.99.-) are enzymes that catalyze the insertion of a
   double bond at the delta position of fatty acids. There seems to be two distinct families of
   fatty acid desaturases which do not seem to be evolutionary related. Family 1 is composed of: -
   Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) (EC 1.14.99.5) [1]. SCD is a key regulatory enzyme of unsaturated
   fatty acid biosynthesis. SCD introduces a cis double bond at the delta(9) position of fatty
   acyl-CoA's such as palmitoleoyl- and oleoyl-CoA. SCD is a membrane-bound enzyme that is thought
   to function as a part of a multienzyme complex in the endoplasmic reticulum of vertebrates and
   fungi. As a signature pattern for this family a conserved region in the C-terminal part of these
   enzymes was selected, this region is rich in histidine residues and in aromatic residues. Family
   2 is composed of: - Plants stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein desaturase (EC 1.14.99.6) [2], these
   enzymes catalyze the introduction of a double bond at the delta(9) position of steraoyl-ACP to
   produce oleoyl-ACP. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of saturated fatty acids to
   unsaturated fatty acids in the synthesis of vegetable oils. - Cyanobacteria desA [3] an enzyme
   that can introduce a second cis double bond at the delta(12) position of fatty acid bound to
   membranes glycerolipids. DesA is involved in chilling tolerance; the phase transition temperature
   of lipids of cellular membranes being dependent on the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids of
   the membrane lipids. As a signature pattern for this family a conserved region in the C-terminal
   part of these enzymes was selected. Consensus pattern: G-E-x-[FY]-H-N-[FY]-H-H-x-F-P-x-D-Y-

  <p> 150. Dihydroorotase signatures </p>
  <p>[0410] Dihydroorotase (EC 3.5.2.3) (DHOase) catalyzes the third step in the de novo
   biosynthesis of pyrimidine, the conversion of ureidosuccinic acid (N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate) into
   dihydroorotate. Dihydroorotase binds a zinc ion which is required for its catalytic activity [1].
   In bacteria, DHOase is a dimer of identical chains of about 400 amino-acid residues (gene pyrC).
   In higher eukaryotes, DHOase is part of a large multi-functional protein known as 'rudimentary'
   in Drosophila and CAD in mammals and which catalyzes the first three steps of pyrimidine
   biosynthesis [2]. The DHOase domain is located in the central part of this polyprotein. In
   yeasts, DHOase is encoded by a monofunctional protein (gene URA4). However, a defective DHOase
   domain [3] is found in a multifunctional protein (gene URA2)that catalyzes the first two steps of
   pyrimidine biosynthesis. The comparison of DHOase sequences from various sources shows [4] that
   there are two highly conserved regions. The first located in the N-terminal extremity contains
   two histidine residues suggested [3] to be involved in binding the zinc ion. The second is found
   in the C-terminal part. Signature patterns for both regions have been developed. Allantoinase (EC
   3.5.2.5) is the enzyme that hydrolyzes allantoin intoallantoate. In yeast (gene DAL1) [5], it is
   the first enzyme in the allanto indegradation pathway; in amphibians [6] and fish it catalyzes
   the second step in the degradation of uric acid. The sequence of allantoinase is evolutionary
   related to that of DHOases. Consensus pattern: D-[LIVMFYWSAP]-H-[LIVA]-H-[LIVF]-[RN]-x-[PGANF]

  <p> 151. dnaJ domains signatures and profile </p>
  <p>[0411] The prokaryotic heat shock protein dnaJ interacts with the chaperone hsp70-like dnaK
   protein [1]. Structurally, the dnaJ protein consists of an N- terminal conserved domain (called
   'J' domain) of about 70 amino acids, a glycine-rich region ('G' domain') of about 30 residues, a
   central domain containing four repeats of a CXXCXGXG motif ('CRR' domain) and a C-terminal region
   of 120 to 170 residues. Such a structure is shown in the following schematic representation:
   EMI179.1 </p>
  <p>[0412] It has been shown [2] that the 'J' domain as well as the 'CRR' domain are also found in
   other prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins which are listed below. a) Proteins containing both a
   'J' and a 'CRR' domain: Yeast protein MAS5/YDJ1 which seems to be involved in mitochondrial
   protein import. Yeast protein MDJ1, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and protein folding.
   Yeast protein SCJ1, involved in protein sorting. Yeast protein XDJ1. Plants dnaJ homologs (from
   leek and cucumber). Human HDJ2, a dnaJ homolog of unknown function. Yeast hypothetical protein
   YNL077w. b) Proteins containing a 'J' domain without a 'CRR' domain: Rhizobium fredii nolC, a
   protein involved in cultivar-specific nodulation of soybean. Escherichia coli cbpA [3], a protein
   that binds curved DNA. Yeast protein SEC63/NPL1, important for protein assembly into the
   endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus. Yeast protein SIS1, required for nuclear migration during
   mitosis. Yeast protein CAJ1. Yeast hypothetical protein YFR041c. Yeast hypothetical protein
   YIR004w. Yeast hypothetical protein YJL162c. Plasmodium falciparum ring-infected erythrocyte

  <p>[0415] Dynein is a multisubunit microtubule-dependent motor enzyme that acts as the force
   generating protein of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. The cytoplasmic isoform of dynein acts as a
   motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules.
   Dynein is composed of a number of ATP-binding large subunits, intermediate size subunits and
   small subunits. Among the small subunits, there is a family [1,2] of highly conserved proteins
   which consist of: - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagellar outer arm dynein 8 Kd and 11 Kd light
   chains. - Higher eukaryotes cytoplasmic dynein light chain 1. - Yeast cytoplasmic dynein light
   chain 1 (gene DYN2 or SLC1). - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical dynein light chains M18.2 and

  <p>[0417] Cytidine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.5) (cytidine aminohydrolase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of
   cytidine into uridine and ammonia while deoxycytidylatedeaminase (EC 3.5.4.12) (dCMP deaminase)
   hydrolyzes dCMP into dUMP. Both enzymes are known to bind zinc and to require it for their
   catalytic activity[1,2]. These two enzymes do not share any sequence similarity with the
   exception of a region that contains three conserved histidine and cysteine residues which are
   thought to be involved in the binding of the catalytic zincion. Such a region is also found in
   other proteins [3,4]: - Yeast cytosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.1) (gene FCY1) which transforms
   cytosine into uracil. - Mammalian apolipoprotein B mRNA editing protein, responsible for the
   postranscriptional editing of a CAA codon into a UAA (stop) codon in the APOB mRNA. - Riboflavin
   biosynthesis protein ribG, which converts 2,5-diamino-6- (ribosylamino)-4(3H)-pyrimidinone
   5'-phosphate into 5-amino-6- (ribosylamino)-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione 5'-phosphate. - Bacillus
   cereus blasticidin-S deaminase (EC 3.5.4.23), which catalyzes the deamination of the cytosine
   moiety of the antibiotics blasticidin S, cytomycin and acetylblasticidin S. - Bacillus subtilis

  <p>[0418] A number of proteins are produced by plants that experience water-stress. Water-stress

  <p>[0422] Dynamin [1,2] is a microtubule-associated force-producing protein of 100 Kd which is
   involved in the production of microtubule bundles and which is able to bind and hydrolyze GTP.
   Dynamin is structurally related to the following proteins: - Drosophila shibire protein (gene
   shi) [3]. Shibire is, very probably, the Drosophila cognate of mammalian dynamin. It seems to
   provide the motor for vesicular transport during endocytosis. - Yeast vacuolar sorting protein
   VPS1 (or SPO15) [4], a protein which could also be involved in microtubule-associated motility. -
   Yeast protein MGM1 [5], which is required for mitochondrial genome maintenance. - Yeast protein
   DNM1, which is involved in endocytosis. - Interferon induced Mx proteins [6,7]. Interferon alpha
   or beta induce the synthesis of a family of closely related proteins. Most of these proteins are
   known to confer resistance to influenza viruses and/or rhabdoviruses on transfected mammalian
   cell in culture. The three motifs found in all GTP-binding proteins are located in the N-terminal
   part of these proteins. The signature pattern that was developed for these proteins is based on a
   highly conserved region downstream of the ATP/GTP-binding motif'A' (P-loop) (see

   Vertebrate (Na+, K+) ATPases (sodium pump) [reviewed in 5,6]. - Gastric (K+, H+) ATPases (proton

   (ECI) [2] are two enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism. ECH catalyzes the hydratation of
   2-trans-enoyl-CoA into 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA and ECI shifts the 3- double bond of the intermediates
   of unsaturated fatty acid oxidation to the 2-trans position. Most eukaryotic cells have two
   fatty-acid beta-oxidation systems, one located in mitochondria and the other in peroxisomes. In
   mitochondria, ECH and ECI are separate yet structurally related monofunctional enzymes.
   Peroxisomes contain a trifunctional enzyme [3] consisting of an N-terminal domain that bears both
   ECH and ECI activity, and a C-terminal domain responsible for 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
   (HCDH) activity. In Escherichia coli (gene fadB) and Pseudomonas fragi (gene faoA), ECH and ECI
   are also part of a multifunctional enzyme which contains both a HCDH and a3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
   epimerase domain [4].A number of other proteins have been found to be evolutionary related to the
   ECH/ECI enzymes or domains: - 3-hydroxbutyryl-coa dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.55) (crotonase), a
   bacterial enzyme involved in the butyrate/butanol-producing pathway. - Naphthoate synthase (EC
   4.1.3.36) (DHNA synthetase) (gene menB) [5], a bacterial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of
   menaquinone (vitamin K2). DHNA synthetase converts O-succinyl-benzoyl-CoA (OSB-CoA) to
   1,4-dihydroxy- 2-naphthoic acid (DHNA). - 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase (EC 3.8.1.6) [6], a

  <p> 166. (EF1BD) Elongation factor 1 beta/beta'/delta chain signatures </p>
  <p>[0428] Eukaryotic elongation factor 1 (EF-1) is responsible for the GTP-dependent binding of
   aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosomes [1]. EF-1 is composed of four subunits: the alpha chain which
   binds GTP and aminoacyl-tRNAs, the gamma chain that probably plays a role in anchoring the
   complex to other cellular components and the beta and delta (or beta') chains. The beta and delta
   chains are highly similar proteins that both stimulate the exchange of GDP bound to the alpha
   chain for GTP [2]. The beta and delta chains are hydrophilic proteins of around 23 to 31 Kd.
   Their C-terminal part seems important for the nucleotide exchange activity, while the N-terminal
   section is probably involved in the interaction with the gamma chain. Two signature patterns for
   this family of proteins were developed. The first corresponds to an acidic region in the central
   section; the second, to the C-terminal extremity of these proteins Consensus pattern:

  <p> 175. ER lumen protein retaining receptor signatures </p>
  <p>[0437] Proteins that reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contain aC-terminal
   tetrapeptide (generally K-D-E-L or H-D-E-L) that serves as a signal for their retrieval
   (retrograde transport) from subsequent compartments of the secretory pathway. The signal is
   recognized by a receptor molecule that is believed to cycle between the cis side of the Golgi
   apparatus and the ER [1]. This protein is known as the ER lumen protein retaining receptor or
   also as the 'KDEL receptor'. It has been characterized in a variety of species, including fungi
   (gene ERD2), plants, Plasmodium, Drosophila and mammals. In mammals two highly related forms of
   the receptor are known. Structurally, the receptor is a protein of about 220 residues that seems
   to contain seven transmembrane regions [2]. The N-terminal part (3 residues) is oriented toward
   the lumen while the C-terminal tail (about 12 residues) is cytoplasmic. There are three lumenal
   and three cytoplasmic loops. Two signature patterns for these receptors were developed. The first
   pattern corresponds to the C-terminal half of the first cytoplasmic loop as well as most of the
   second transmembrane domain. The second pattern is a perfectly conserved decapeptide that
   corresponds to the central part of the fifth transmembrane domain. Consensus pattern:

   via ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase. ETF is an heterodimer that consist of an alpha and a beta
   subunit and which bind one molecule of FAD per dimer. A similar system also exists in some
   bacteria. The beta subunit of ETF is a protein of about 28 Kd which is structurally related to
   the bacterial nitrogen fixation protein fixA which could play a role in a redox process and feed
   electrons to ferredoxin. Other related proteins are: - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein

  <p> 177. Endonuclease III signatures </p>
  <p>[0439] Escherichia coli endonuclease III (EC 4.2.99.18) (gene nth) [1] is a DNA repair enzyme
   that acts both as a DNA N-glycosylase, removing oxidized pyrimidines from DNA, and as an
   apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, introducing a single-strand nick at the site from which
   the damaged base was removed. Endonuclease III is an iron-sulfur protein that binds a single
   4Fe-4Scluster. The 4Fe-4S cluster does not seem to be important for catalytic activity, but is
   probably involved in the proper positioning of the enzyme along the DNA strand [2].Endonuclease
   III is evolutionary related to the following proteins: - Fission yeast endonuclease III homolog
   (gene nth1) [3]. - Escherichia coli and related protein DNA repair protein mutY, which is an
   adenine glycosylase. MutY is a larger protein (350 amino acids) than endonuclease III (211 amino
   acids). - Micrococcus luteus ultraviolet N-glycosylase/AP lyase which initiates repair at cis-syn
   pyrimidine dimers. - ORF10 in plasmid pFV1 of the thermophilic archaebacteria Methanobacterium
   thermoformicicum [4]. Restriction methylase m.MthTI, which is encoded by this plasmid, generates
   5-methylcytosine which is subject to deamination resulting in G-T mismatches. This protein could
   correct these mismatches. - Yeast hypothetical protein YAL015c. - Fission yeast hypothetical
   protein SpAC26A3.02. - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein R10E4.5. - Methanococcus
   jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0613.The 4Fe-4S cluster is bound by four cysteines which are
   all located in a 17amino acid region at the C-terminal end of endonuclease III. A similar region
   is also present in the central section of mutY and in the C-terminus of ORF10 and of the
   Micrococcus UV endonuclease. The 4Fe-4S cluster region does not exist in YAL015c. Two signature
   patterns for these proteins were developed: the first corresponds to the core of the iron-sulfur
   binding domain, the second corresponds to the best conserved region in the catalytic core of
   these enzymes. Consensus pattern: C-x(3)-[KRS]-P-[KRAGL]-C-x(2)-C-x(5)-C [The four C's are 4Fe-4S

  <p> 183. (efhand) S-100/ICaBP type calcium binding protein signature </p>
  <p>[0446] S-100 are small dimeric acidic calcium and zinc-binding proteins [1] abundant in the
   brain. They have two different types of calcium-binding sites: a low affinity one with a special
   structure and a 'normal' EF-hand type high affinity site. The vitamin-D dependent intestinal
   calcium-binding proteins (ICaBP or calbindin 9 Kd) also belong to this family of proteins, but it
   does not form dimers. In the past years the sequences of many new members of this family have
   been determined (for reviews see [2,3,4]); in most cases the function of these proteins is not
   yet known, although it is becoming clearthat they are involved in cell growth and
   differentiation, cell cycle regulation and metabolic control. These proteins are: - Calcyclin
   (Prolactin receptor associated protein (PRA); clatropin; 2a9; 5B10; S100A6). - Calpactin I light
   chain (p10; p11; 42c; S100A10). - Calgranulin A (cystic fibrosis antigen (CFAg); MIF related
   protein 8 (MRP- 8); p8; S100A8). - Calgranulin B (MIF related protein 14 (MRP-14); p14; S100A9).
   - Calgranulin C. - Calgizzarin (S100C). - Placental calcium-binding protein (CAPL) (18a2; peL98;
   42a; p9K; MTS1; metastatin; S100A4). - Protein S-100D (S100A5). - Protein S-100E (S100A3). -
   Protein S-100L (CAN19; S100A2). - Placental protein S-100P (S100E). - Psoriasin (S100A7). -
   Chemotactic cytokine CP-10 [5]. - Protein MRP-126 [6]. - Trichohyalin [7]. This is a large
   intermediate filament-associated protein that associates with keratin intermediate filaments
   (KIF); it contains a S- 100 type domain in its N-terminal extremity. A number of these proteins
   are known to bind calcium while others are not (p10for example). Our EF-hand detecting pattern
   will fail to pick those proteins which have lost their calcium-binding properties. A pattern was
   developed which unambiguously picks up proteins belonging to this family. This pattern spans the
   region of the EF-hand high affinity site but makes no assumptions on the calcium-binding
   properties of this site. Consensus pattern:

  <p> EF-hand calcium-binding domain </p>
  <p>[0447] Many calcium-binding proteins belong to the same evolutionary family and share a type of
   calcium-binding domain known as the EF-hand [1 to 5]. This type of domain consists of a twelve
   residue loop flanked on both side by a twelve residue alpha-helical domain. In an EF-hand loop
   the calcium ion is coordinated in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration. The six residues
   involved in the binding are in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12; these residues are denoted by X,
   Y, Z, -Y, -X and -Z. The invariant Glu or Asp at position 12 provides two oxygens for liganding
   Ca (bidentate ligand). Listed below are the proteins which are known to contain EF-hand regions.
   For each type of protein the total number of EF-hand regions known or supposed to exist is
   indicated between parenthesis. This number does not include regions which clearly have lost their
   calcium-binding properties, or the atypical low-affinity site (which spans thirteen residues)

  <p>[0448] There has been a number of attempts [7,8] to develop patterns that pick-up EF-hand
   regions, but these studies were made a few years ago when not so many different families of
   calcium-binding proteins were known. Therefore a new pattern was developed which takes into
   account all published sequences. This pattern includes the complete EF-hand loop as well as the
   first residue which follows the loop and which seem to always be hydrophobic. Consensus pattern:
   D-x-[DNS]- {ILVFYW} -[DENSTG]-[DNQGHRK]- {GP} -[LIVMC]-[DENQSTAGC]-x(2)-[DE]-[LIVMFYW] Note:
   positions 1 (X), 3 (Y) and 12 (-Z) are the most conserved. Note: the 6th residue in an EF-hand
   loop is, in most cases a Gly, but the number of exceptions to this 'rule' has gradually increased
   and therefore the pattern should include all the different residues which have been shown to
   exist in this position in functional Ca-binding sites. Note: the pattern will, in some cases,
   miss one of the EF-hand regions in some proteins with multiple EF-hand domains. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Kawasaki H.,

  <p> 184. Enolase signature </p>
  <p>[0449] Enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the dehydration of
   2-phospho-D-glycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate [1]. It is a dimeric enzyme that requires magnesium
   both for catalysis and stabilizing the dimer. Enolase is probably found in all organisms that
   metabolize sugars. In vertebrates, there are three different tissue-specific isozymes: alpha
   present in most tissues, beta in muscles and gamma found only in nervous tissues. Taucrystallin,
   one of the major lens proteins in some fish, reptiles and birds, has been shown [2] to be
   evolutionary related to enolase. As a signature pattern for enolase, the best conserved region
   was selected, it is located in the C-terminal third of the sequence.- Consensus pattern:

   Unlike gelsolin and severin this protein does not sever actin filaments. The F-actin capping
   protein is a heterodimer composed of two unrelated subunits: alpha and beta.The alpha subunit is
   a protein of about 268 to 286 amino acid residues whose sequence is well conserved in eukaryotic
   species [1]. As signature patterns two highly conserved regions in the C-terminal section of the

  <p> 189. Fatty acid desaturases signatures (FA_desaturase) </p>
  <p>[0459] Fatty acid desaturases (EC 1.14.99.-) are enzymes that catalyze the insertion of a
   double bond at the delta position of fatty acids. There seems to be two distinct families of
   fatty acid desaturases which do not seem to be evolutionary related. Family 1 is composed of: -
   Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) (EC 1.14.99.5) [1]. SCD is a key regulatory enzyme of unsaturated
   fatty acid biosynthesis. SCD introduces a cis double bond at the delta(9) position of fatty
   acyl-CoA's such as palmitoleoyl- and oleoyl-CoA. SCD is a membrane-bound enzyme that is thought
   to function as a part of a multienzyme complex in the endoplasmic reticulum of vertebrates and
   fungi. As a signature pattern for this family a conserved region in the C-terminal part of these
   enzymes was selected, this region is rich in histidine residues and in aromatic residues. Family
   2 is composed of: - Plants stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein desaturase (EC 1.14.99.6) [2], these
   enzymes catalyze the introduction of a double bond at the delta(9) position of steraoyl-ACP to
   produce oleoyl-ACP. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of saturated fatty acids to
   unsaturated fatty acids in the synthesis of vegetable oils. - Cyanobacteria desA [3] an enzyme
   that can introduce a second cis double bond at the delta(12) position of fatty acid bound to
   membranes glycerolipids. DesA is involved in chilling tolerance; the phase transition temperature
   of lipids of cellular membranes being dependent on the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids of
   the membrane lipids. As a signature pattern for this family a conserved region in the C-terminal
   part of these enzymes was selected. Consensus pattern: G-E-x-[FY]-H-N-[FY]-H-H-x-F-P-x-D-Y-

  <p>[0460] Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) (FBPase) [1], a regulatory enzyme in
   gluconeogenesis, catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate.
   It is involved in many different metabolic pathways and found in most
   organisms.Sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.37) (SBPase) [2] is an enzyme found plant

   1,7-bisphosphate to sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, a step in the Calvin's reductive pentose phosphate
   cycle. It is functionally and structurally related to FBPase. In mammalian FBPase, a lysine
   residue has been shown to be involved in the catalytic mechanism [3]. The region around this
   residue is highly conserved and can be used as a signature pattern for FBPase and SBPase. It must

  <p> 192. FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase signatures/profile (FKBP) </p>
  <p>[0462] FKBP [1,2,3] is the major high-affinity binding protein, in vertebrates, for the
   immunosuppressive drug FK506. It exhibits peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity (EC
   5.2.1.8) (PPIase or rotamase). PPIase is an enzyme that accelerates protein folding by catalyzing
   the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides [4].At least three
   different forms of FKBP are known in mammalian species: - FKBP-12, which is cytosolic and
   inhibited by both FK506 and rapamycin. - FKBP-13, which is membrane associated and inhibited by
   both FK506 and rapamycin. - FKBP-25, which is preferentially inhibited by rapamycin. These forms
   of FKBP are evolutionary related and show extensive similarities[5,6,7] with the following
   proteins: - Fungal FKBP. - Mammalian hsp binding immunophilin (HBI) (also called p59). HBI is a
   protein which binds to hsp90 and contains two FKBP-like domains in its N- terminal section - the
   first of which seems to be functional. - The C-terminal part of the cell-surface protein mip from
   Legionella; a protein associated with macrophage infection by an unknown mechanism. - Escherichia
   coli slyD [8], a protein with a N-terminal FKBP domain followed by an histidine-rich
   metal-binding domain. - Escherichia coli fkpA. - Escherichia coli fklB (FKBP22). - Escherichia
   coli slpA. - Bacterial trigger factor (Tig). - Streptomyces hygroscopus and chrysomallus
   FK506-binding protein. - Chlamydia trachomatis 27 Kd membrane protein. - Neisseria meningitidis
   strain C114 PPiase. - Probable PPiases from Haemophilus influenzae (HI0754), Methanococcus
   jannaschii (MJ0278 and MJ0825), Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonase aeruginosa. Two
   signature patterns for these proteins were developed. One is based on a conserved region in the
   N-terminus of FKBP, the other is located in the central section. The profile for FKBP spans the

  <p> 194. FMN-dependent alpha-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases active site (FMN_dh) </p>
  <p>[0465] A number of oxidoreductases that act on alpha-hydroxy acids and which are FMN-containing
   flavoproteins have been shown [1,2,3] to be structurally related; these enzymes are: - Lactate
   dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.2.3), which consists of a dehydrogenase domain and a heme-binding domain
   called cytochrome b2 and which catalyzes the conversion of lactate into pyruvate. - Glycolate
   oxidase (EC 1.1.3.15) ((S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase), a peroxisomal enzyme that catalyzes the
   conversion of glycolate and oxygen to glyoxylate and hydrogen peroxide. - Long chain
   alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase from rat (EC 1.1.3.15), a peroxisomal enzyme. - Lactate
   2-monooxygenase (EC 1.13.12.4) (lactate oxidase) from Mycobacterium smegmatis, which catalyzes
   the conversion of lactate and oxygen to acetate, carbon dioxide and water. - (S)-mandelate
   dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida (gene mdlB), which catalyzes the reduction of (S)-mandelate
   to benzoylformate. The first step in the reaction mechanism of these enzymes is the abstraction
   of the proton from the alpha-carbon of the substrate producing a carbanion which can subsequently
   attach to the N5 atom of FMN. A conserved histidine has been shown [4] to be involved in the
   removal of the proton. The region around this active site residue is highly conserved and
   contains an arginine residue which is involved in substrate binding. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0475] Isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS) [1,2] is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of
   penicillin and cephalosporin. In the presence of oxygen, it removes iron and ascorbate, four
   hydrogen atoms from L-(alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-d-valine to form the azetidinone and
   thiazolidine rings of isopenicillin. IPNS is an enzyme of about 330 amino-acid residues. Two
   cysteines are conserved in fungal and bacterial IPNS sequences; these may be involved in
   iron-binding and/or substrate-binding. Cephalosporium acremonium DAOCS/DACS [3] is a bifunctional
   enzyme involved in cephalosporin biosynthesis. The DAOCS domain, which is structurally related to
   IPNS, catalyzes the step from penicillin N to deacetoxy-cephalosporin C - used as a substrate by
   DACS to form deacetylcephalosporin C. Streptomycesclavuligerus possesses a monofunctional DAOCS

  <p> 200. Fibrillarin signature </p>
  <p>[0476] Fibrillarin [1] is a component of a nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein(SnRNP)
   particle thought to participate in the first step of the processing of pre-rRNA. In mammals,
   fibrillarin is associated with the U3, U8 and U13small nuclear RNAs [2]. Fibrillarin is an
   extremely well conserved protein of about 320 amino acid residues. Structurally it consists of
   three different domains: - An N-terminal domain of about 80 amino acids which is very rich in
   glycine and contains a number of dimethylated arginine residues (DMA). - A central domain of
   about 90 residues which resembles that of RNA-binding proteins and contains an octameric sequence
   similar to the RNP-2 consensus found in such proteins. - A C-terminal alpha-helical domain. A
   protein evolutionary related to fibrillarin has been found [3] in archaebacteria such as
   Methanococcus vannielii or voltae. This protein (geneflpA) is involved in pre-rRNA processing. It
   lacks the Gly/Arg-rich N-terminal domain. As a signature pattern, a region was selected that
   starts with and encompases theRNP-2 like octapeptide sequence. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 203. 2Fe-2S ferredoxins, iron-sulfur binding region signature (fer2A) </p>
  <p>[0479] Ferredoxins [1] are a group of iron-sulfur proteins which mediate electron transfer in a
   wide variety of metabolic reactions. Ferredoxins can be divided into several subgroups depending
   upon the physiological nature of the iron sulfur cluster(s) and according to sequence
   similarities. One of these subgroups are the 2Fe-2S ferredoxins, which are proteins or domains of
   around one hundred amino acid residues that bind a single 2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster. The
   proteins that are known [2] to belong to this family are listed below. - Ferredoxin from
   photosynthetic organisms; namely plants and algae where it is located in the chloroplast or
   cyanelle; and cyanobacteria. - Ferredoxin from archaebacteria of the Halobacterium genus. -
   Ferredoxin IV (gene pftA) and V (gene fdxD) from Rhodobacter capsulatus. - Ferredoxin in the
   toluene degradation operon (gene xylT) and naphthalene degradation operon (gene nahT) of
   Pseudomonas putida. - Hypothetical Escherichia coli protein yfaE. - The N-terminal domain of the
   bifunctional ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase electron transfer component of the benzoate
   1,2-dioxygenase complex (gene benC) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the toluene 4-monooxygenase
   complex (gene tmoF), the toluate 1,2-dioxygenase system (gene xylZ), and the xylene monooxygenase
   system (gene xylA) from Pseudomonas. - The N-terminal domain of phenol hydroxylase protein p5
   (gene dmpP) from Pseudomonas Putida. - The N-terminal domain of methane monooxygenase component C
   (gene mmoC) from Methylococcus capsulatus . - The C-terminal domain of the vanillate degradation
   pathway protein vanB in a Pseudomonas species. - The N-terminal domain of bacterial fumarate
   reductase iron-sulfur protein (gene frdB). - The N-terminal domain of CDP-6-deoxy-3,4-glucoseen

   succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron- sulfur protein. - The N-terminal domain of eukaryotic
   xanthine dehydrogenase. - The N-terminal domain of eukaryotic aldehyde oxidase. In the 2Fe-2S
   ferredoxins, four cysteine residues bind the iron-sulfur cluster. Three of these cysteines are
   clustered together in the same region of the protein. Our signature pattern spans that

  <p>[0480] Ferredoxins [1] are a group of iron-sulfur proteins which mediate electron transfer in a
   wide variety of metabolic reactions. Ferredoxins can be divided into several subgroups depending
   upon the physiological nature of the iron sulfur cluster(s) and according to sequence
   similarities. One family of ferredoxins groups together the following proteins that all bind a
   single 2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster: - Adrenodoxin (ADX) (adrenal ferredoxin), a vertebrate
   mitochondrial protein which transfers electrons from adrenodoxin reductase to cytochrome P450scc,
   which is involved in cholesterol side chain cleavage. - Putidaredoxin (PTX), a Pseudomonas putida
   protein which transfers electrons from putidaredoxin reductase to cytochrome P450-cam, which is
   involved in the oxidation of camphor. - Terpredoxin [2], a Pseudomonas protein which transfers
   electrons from terpredoxin reductase to cytochrome P450-terp, which is involved in the oxidation
   of alpha-terpineol. - Rhodocoxin [3], a Rhodococcus protein which transfers electrons from
   rhodocoxin reductase to cytochrome CYP116 (thcB), which is involved in the degradation of
   thiocarbamate herbicides. - Escherichia coli ferredoxin (gene fdx) [4] whose exact function is
   not yet known. - Rhodobacter capsulatus ferredoxin VI [5], which may transfer electrons to a yet
   uncharacterized oxygenase. - Caulobacter crescentus ferredoxin (gene fdxB) [6].In these proteins,
   four cysteine residues bind the iron-sulfur cluster. Three of these cysteines are clustered
   together in the same region of the protein. Our signature pattern spans that iron-sulfur binding

  <p> 204. 4Fe-4S ferredoxins, iron-sulfur binding region signature (fer4) </p>
  <p>[0481] Ferredoxins [1] are a group of iron-sulfur proteins which mediate electron transfer in a
   wide variety of metabolic reactions. Ferredoxins can be divided into several subgroups depending
   upon the physiological nature of the iron-sulfur cluster(s). One of these subgroups are the
   4Fe-4S ferredoxins, which are found in bacteria and which are thus often referred as
   'bacterial-type' ferredoxins. The structure of these proteins [2] consists of the duplication of
   a domain of twenty six amino acid residues; each of these domains contains four cysteine residues
   that bind to a 4Fe-4S center. A number of proteins have been found [3] that include one or more
   4Fe-4Sbinding domains similar to those of bacterial-type ferredoxins. These proteins are listed
   below (references are only provided for recently determined sequences). - The iron-sulfur
   proteins of the succinate dehydrogenase and the fumarate reductase complexes (EC 1.3.99.1). These
   enzyme complexes, which are components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, each contain three
   subunits: a flavoprotein, an iron-sulfur protein, and a b-type cytochrome. The iron- sulfur
   proteins contain three different iron-sulfur centers: a 2Fe-2S, a 3Fe-3S and a 4Fe-4S.-
   Escherichia coli anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5) This enzyme is
   composed of three subunits: A, B, and C. The C subunit seems to be an iron-sulfur protein with
   two ferredoxin-like domains in the N-terminal part of the protein. - Escherichia coli anaerobic
   dimethyl sulfoxide reductase. The B subunit of this enzyme (gene dmsB) is an iron-sulfur protein
   with four 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-like domains. - Escherichia coli formate hydrogenlyase. Two of the
   subunits of this oligomeric complex (genes hycB and hycF) seem to be iron-sulfur proteins that
   each contain two 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-like domains. - Methanobacterium formicicum formate
   dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2). This enzyme is used by the archaebacteria to grow on formate. The
   beta chain of this dimeric enzyme probably binds two 4Fe-4S centers. - Escherichia coli formate
   dehydrogenases N and O (EC 1.2.1.2). The beta chain of these two enzymes (genes fdnH and fdoH)
   are iron-sulfur proteins with four 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-like domains. - Desulfovibrio periplasmic
   [Fe] hydrogenase (EC 1.18.99.1). The large chain of this dimeric enzyme binds three 4Fe-4S
   centers, two of which are located in the ferredoxin-like N-terminal region of the protein. -
   Methanobacterium thermoautrophicum methyl viologen-reducing hydrogenase subunit mvhB, which
   contains six tandemly repeated ferredoxin-like domains and which probably binds twelve 4Fe-4S
   centers. - Salmonella typhimurium anaerobic sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.-) [4]. Two of the
   subunits of this enzyme (genes asrA and asrC) seem to both bind two 4Fe-4S centers. - A
   Ferredoxin-like protein (gene fixX) from the nitrogen-fixation genes locus of various Rhizobium
   species, and one from the Nif-region of Azotobacter species. - The 9 Kd polypeptide of
   chloroplast photosystem I [5] (gene psaC). This protein contains two low potential 4Fe-4S
   centers, referred as the A and B centers. - The chloroplast frxB protein which is predicted to
   carry two 4Fe-4S centers. - An ferredoxin from a primitive eukaryote, the enteric amoeba
   Entamobea histolytica. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjjW, a protein with a N-terminal
   region belonging to the radical activating enzymes family (see &lt;PDOC00834&gt;) and two
   potential 4Fe-4S centers.The pattern of cysteine residues in the iron-sulfur region is sufficient
   todetect this class of 4Fe-4S binding proteins. Consensus pattern: C-x(2)-C-x(2)-C-x(3)-C-[PEG]

  <p> 205. NifH/frxC family signatures (fer4_NifH) </p>
  <p>[0482] Nitrogenase (EC 1.18.6.1) [1] is the enzyme system responsible for biological nitrogen
   fixation. Nitrogenase is an oligomeric complex which consists of two components: component 1
   which contains the active site for the reduction of nitrogen to ammonia and component 2 (also
   called the iron protein).Component 2 is a homodimer of a protein (gene nifH) which binds a single
   4Fe-4S iron sulfur cluster [2]. In the nitrogen fixation process nifH is first reduced by a
   protein such as ferredoxin; the reduced protein then transfers electrons to component 1 with the
   concomitant consumption of ATP.A number of proteins are known to be evolutionary related to nifH.
   These proteins are: - Chloroplast encoded frxC (or chlL) protein [3]. FrxC is encoded on the
   chloroplast genome of some plant species, its exact function is not known, but it could act as an
   electron carrier in the conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide. - Rhodobacter
   capsulatus proteins bchL and bchX [4]. These proteins are also likely to play a role in
   chlorophyll synthesis. There are a number of conserved regions in the sequence of these proteins:
   in the N-terminal section there is an ATP-binding site motif'A' (P-loop) and in the central
   section there are two conserved cysteines which have been shown, in nifH, to be the ligands of
   the 4Fe-4S cluster. Two signatures patterns that correspond to the regions around these cysteines
   were developed. Consensus pattern: E-x-G-G-P-x(2)-[GA]-x-G-C-[AG]-G [C binds the iron-sulfur

  <p> 206. Ferritin iron-binding regions signatures </p>
  <p> [0483] Ferritin [1,2] is one of the major non-heme iron storage proteins. It consists of a
   mineral core of hydrated ferric oxide, and a multi-subunit protein shell which englobes the
   former and assures its solubility in an aqueous environment. In animals the protein is mainly
   cytoplasmic and there are generally two or more genes that encodes for closely related subunits
   (in mammals there are two subunits which are known as H(eavy) and L(ight)). In plants ferritin is
   found in the chloroplast [3].There are a number of well conserved region in the sequence of
   ferritins. Two of these regions to develop signature patterns were selected. The first pattern is
   located in the central part of the sequence of ferritin and it contains three conserved glutamate
   which are thought to be involved in the binding of iron. The second pattern is located in the
   C-terminal section, it corresponds to a region which forms a hydrophilic channel through which
   small molecules and ions can gain access to the central cavity of the molecule; this pattern also
   includes conserved acidic residues which are potential metal-binding sites. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 207. Intermediate filaments signature (filament) </p>
  <p>[0484] Intermediate filaments (IF) [1,2,3] are proteins which are primordial components of the
   cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelope. They generally form filamentous structures 8 to 14 nm
   wide. IF proteins are members of a very large multigene family of proteins which has been
   subdivided in five major subgroups: - Type I: Acidic cytokeratins. - Type II: Basic cytokeratins.
   - Type III: Vimentin, desmin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), peripherin, and plasticin.
   - Type IV: Neurofilaments L, H and M, alpha-internexin and nestin. - Type V: Nuclear lamins A,
   B1, B2 and C. All IF proteins are structurally similar in that they consist of: a central rod
   domain comprising some 300 to 350 residues which is arranged in coiled-coiled alpha-helices, with
   at least two short characteristic interruptions; a N-terminal non-helical domain (head) of
   variable length; and a C-terminal domain (tail) which is also non-helical, and which shows
   extreme length variation between different IF proteins. While IF proteins are evolutionary and
   structurally related, they have limited sequence homologies except in several regions of the rod

  <p> 208. Flavodoxin signature </p>
  <p>[0485] Flavodoxins [1,E1] are electron-transfer proteins that function in various electron
   transport systems. Flavodoxins bind one FMN molecule, which serves as a redox-active prosthetic
   group. Flavodoxins are functionally interchangeable with ferredoxins. They have been isolated
   from prokaryotes, cyanobacteria, and some eukaryotic algae. The signature pattern for these
   proteins is derived from a conserved region in their N-terminal section, this region is involved
   in the binding of the FMN phosphate group. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0486] A number of receptors for lymphokines, hematopoeitic growth factors and growth
   hormone-related molecules have been found [1 to 5] to share a common binding domain. Receptors
   known to belong to this family are: - Cytokine receptor common beta chain. This chain is common
   to the IL-3, IL-5 and GM-CSF receptors. - Cytokine receptor common gamma chain. This chain is
   common to the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 and IL-13 receptors. - Ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor
   (CNTFR). - Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR). - Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor
   (G-CSFR). - Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor alpha chain (GM- CSFR). -

   receptor (IL9R). - Growth hormone receptor (GRHR). - Prolactin receptor (PRLR). - Thrombopoeitin
   receptor (TPOR).The conserved region constitutes all or part of the extracellular ligand-binding
   region and is about 200 amino acid residues long. In the N-terminal of this domain there are two
   pairs of cysteines known, in the growth hormone receptor, to be involved in disulfide bonds.

  <p>[0487] Phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.2) (GART) [1] catalyzes the third
   step in de novo purine biosynthesis, the transfer of a formyl group to
   5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide. In higher eukaryotes, GART is part of a multifunctional enzyme
   polypeptide that catalyzes three of the steps of purine biosynthesis. In bacteria, plants and
   yeast, GART is a monofunctional protein of about 200 amino-acid residues. In the Escherichia coli
   enzyme, an aspartic acid residue has been shown to be involved in the catalytic mechanism. The
   region around this active site residue is well conserved in GART from prokaryotic and eukaryotic
   sources and can be used as a signature pattern. Mammalian formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase
   (EC 1.5.1.6) [2] is a cytosolicenzyme responsible for the NADP-dependent decarboxylative
   reduction of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate. It is a protein of about 900 amino
   acids consisting of three domains; the N-terminal domain (200 residues) is structurally related
   to GARTs.Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.9) (gene fmt) [3]is the
   enzyme responsible for modifying the free amino group of the aminoacylmoiety of methionyl-

  <p> 214. GATA-type zinc finger domain </p>
  <p>[0491] The GATA family of transcription factors are proteins that bind to DNA sites with the
   consensus sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G), found within the regulatory region of a number of genes.
   Proteins currently known to belong to this family are: - GATA-1 [1] (also known as Eryf1, GF-1 or
   NF-E1), which binds to the GATA region of globin genes and other genes expressed in erythroid
   cells. It is a transcriptional activator which probably serves as a general 'switch' factor for
   erythroid development. - GATA-2 [2], a transcriptional activator which regulates endothelin-1
   gene expression in endothelial cells. - GATA-3 [3], a transcriptional activator which binds to
   the enhancer of the T-cell receptor alpha and delta genes. - GATA-4 [4], a transcriptional
   activator expressed in endodermally derived tissues and heart. - Drosophila protein pannier (or
   DGATAa) (gene pnr) which acts as a repressor of the achaete-scute complex (as-c). - Bombyx mori
   BCFI [5], which regulates the expression of chorion genes. - Caenorhabditis elegans elt-1 and
   elt-2, transcriptional activators of genes containing the GATA region, including vitellogenin
   genes [6]. - Ustilago maydis urbs1 [7], a protein involved in the repression of the biosynthesis
   of siderophores.- Fission yeast protein GAF2.All these transcription factors contain a pair of
   highly similar 'zinc finger' type domains with the consensus sequence C-x2-C-x17-C-x2-C.Some
   other proteins contain a single zinc finger motif highly related to those of the GATA
   transcription factors. These proteins are: - Drosophila box A-binding factor (ABF) (also known as
   protein serpent (gene srp)) which may function as a transcriptional activator protein and may
   play a key role in the organogenesis of the fat body. - Emericella nidulans areA [8], a
   transcriptional activator which mediates nitrogen metabolite repression. - Neurospora crassa
   nit-2 [9], a transcriptional activator which turns on the expression of genes coding for enzymes
   required for the use of a variety of secondary nitrogen sources, during conditions of nitrogen
   limitation. - Neurospora crassa white collar proteins 1 and 2 (WC-1 and WC-2), which control
   expression of light-regulated genes. - Saccharomyces cerevisiae DAL81 (or UGA43), a negative
   nitrogen regulatory protein. - Saccharomyces cerevisiae GLN3, a positive nitrogen regulatory
   protein. - Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAT1. - Saccharomyces cerevisiae GZF3. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 215. Glutamine amidotransferases class-I active site (GATase) </p>
  <p>[0492] A large group of biosynthetic enzymes are able to catalyze the removal of the ammonia
   group from glutamine and then to transfer this group to a substrate to form a new carbon-nitrogen
   group. This catalytic activity is known asglutamine amidotransferase (GATase) (EC 2.4.2.-) [1].
   The GATase domain exists either as a separate polypeptidic subunit or as part of a larger
   polypeptide fused in different ways to a synthase domain. On the basis of sequence similarities
   two classes of GATase domains have been identified [2,3]: class-I(also known as trpG-type) and
   class-II (also known as purF-type). Class-I GATase domains have been found in the following
   enzymes: - The second component of anthranilate synthase (AS) (EC 4.1.3.27) [4]. AS catalyzes the
   biosynthesis of anthranilate from chorismate and glutamine. AS is generally a dimeric enzyme: the
   first component can synthesize anthranilate using ammonia rather than glutamine, whereas
   component II provides the GATase activity. In some bacteria and in fungi the GATase component of
   AS is part of a multifunctional protein that also catalyzes other steps of the biosynthesis of
   tryptophan. - The second component of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (ADC) synthase (EC 4.1.3. -), a
   dimeric prokaryotic enzyme that function in the pathway that catalyzes the biosynthesis of
   para-aminobenzoate (PABA) from chorismate and glutamine. The second component (gene pabA)
   provides the GATase activity [4]. - CTP synthase (EC 6.3.4.2). CTP synthase catalyzes the final
   reaction in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine, the ATP-dependent formation of CTP from UTP and
   glutamine. CTP synthase is a single chain enzyme that contains two distinct domains; the GATase
   domain is in the C-terminal section [2]. - GMP synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing) (EC 6.3.5.2). GMP
   synthase catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of GMP from xanthosine 5'-phosphate and glutamine.
   GMP synthase is a single chain enzyme that contains two distinct domains; the GATase domain is in
   the N-terminal section [5]. - Glutamine-dependent carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.5.5)
   (GD-CPSase); an enzyme involved in both arginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and which catalyzes
   the ATP-dependent formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine and carbon dioxide. In bacteria
   GD-CPSase is composed of two subunits: the large chain (gene carB) provides the CPSase activity,
   while the small chain (gene carA) provides the GATase activity. In yeast the enzyme involved in
   arginine biosynthesis is also composed of two subunits: CPA1 (GATase), and CPA2 (CPSase). In most
   eukaryotes, the first three steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis are catalyzed by a large
   multifunctional enzyme (called URA2 in yeast, rudimentary in Drosophila, and CAD in mammals). The
   GATase domain is located at the N-terminal extremity of this polyprotein [6]. -
   Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase II (EC 6.3.5.3), an enzyme that catalyzes the fourth
   step in the de novo biosynthesis of purines. In some species of bacteria, FGAM synthase II is
   composed of two subunits: a small chain (gene purQ) which provides the GATase activity and a
   large chain (gene purL) which provides the aminator activity. - The histidine amidotransferase
   hisH, an enzyme that catalyzes the fifth step in the biosynthesis of histidine in prokaryotes.ln
   the second component of AS a cysteine has been shown [7] to be essentialfor the amidotransferase
   activity. The sequence around this residue is well conserved in all the above GATase domains and
   can be used as a signature pattern for class-I GATase.- Consensus pattern:

   the transfer of the ammonia group of glutamine to PRPP to form 5-phosphoribosylamine (gene purF
   in bacteria, ADE4 in yeast). - Glucosamine--fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.16).
   This enzyme catalyzes a key reaction in amino sugar synthesis, the formation of glucosamine
   6-phosphate from fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine (gene glmS in Escherichia coli, nodM in
   Rhizobium, GFA1 in yeast) - Asparagine synthetase (glutamine-hydrolyzing) (EC 6.3.5.4). This
   enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of asparagine from aspartate and glutamine. A cysteine is
   present at the N-terminal extremity of the mature form of all these enzymes. The cysteine has
   been shown, in amido phosphoribosyltransferase [4] and in asparagine synthetase [5] to be

   involved in cyanogenis, the release of hydrogen cyanide from injured tissues. These enzymes are
   proteins of size ranging from 556 (CHD) to 664 (MOX) amino acid residues which share a number of
   regions of sequence similarities. One of these regions, located in the N-terminal section,
   corresponds to the FAD ADP-binding domain. The function of the other conserved domains is not yet
   known; two of these domains were selected as signature patterns. The first one is located in the
   N-terminal section of these enzymes, about 50 residues after the ADP-binding domain, while the
   second one is located in the central section. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0501] Glutamine amidotransferases class-I active site </p>
  <p>[0502] A large group of biosynthetic enzymes are able to catalyze the removal of the ammonia
   group from glutamine and then to transfer this group to a substrate to form a new carbon-nitrogen
   group. This catalytic activity is known as glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) (EC 2.4.2.-) [1].
   The GATase domain exists either as a separate polypeptidic subunit or as part of a larger
   polypeptide fused in different ways to a synthase domain. On the basis of sequence similarities
   two classes of GATase domains have been identified [2,3]: class-I (also known as trpG-type) and
   class-II (also known as purF-type). Class-I GATase domains have been found in the following
   enzymes: The second component of anthranilate synthase (AS) (EC 4.1.3.27) [4]. AS catalyzes the
   biosynthesis of anthranilate from chorismate and glutamine. AS is generally a dimeric enzyme: the
   first component can synthesize anthranilate using ammonia rather than glutamine, whereas
   component II provides the GATase activity. In some bacteria and in fungi the GATase component of
   AS is part of a multifunctional protein that also catalyzes other steps of the biosynthesis of
   tryptophan. The second component of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (ADC) synthase (EC 4.1.3.-), a
   dimeric prokaryotic enzyme that function in the pathway that catalyzes the biosynthesis of
   para-aminobenzoate (PABA) from chorismate and glutamine. The second component (gene pabA)
   provides the GATase activity [4]. CTP synthase (EC 6.3.4.2). CTP synthase catalyzes the final
   reaction in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine, the ATP-dependent formation of CTP from UTP and
   glutamine. CTP synthase is a single chain enzyme that contains two distinct domains; the GATase
   domain is in the C-terminal section [2]. GMP synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing) (EC 6.3.5.2). GMP
   synthase catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of GMP from xanthosine 5'-phosphate and glutamine.
   GMP synthase is a single chain enzyme that contains two distinct domains; the GATase domain is in
   the N-terminal section [5]. Glutamine-dependent carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.5.5)
   (GD-CPSase); an enzyme involved in both arginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and which catalyzes
   the ATP-dependent formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine and carbon dioxide. In bacteria
   GD-CPSase is composed of two subunits: the large chain (gene carB) provides the CPSase activity,
   while the small chain (gene carA) provides the GATase activity. In yeast the enzyme involved in
   arginine biosynthesis is also composed of two subunits: CPA1 (GATase), and CPA2 (CPSase). In most
   eukaryotes, the first three steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis are catalyzed by a large
   multifunctional enzyme (called URA2 in yeast, rudimentary in Drosophila, and CAD in mammals). The
   GATase domain is located at the N-terminal extremity of this polyprotein [6].
   Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase II (EC 6.3.5.3), an enzyme that catalyzes the fourth
   step in the de novo biosynthesis of purines. In some species of bacteria, FGAM synthase II is
   composed of two subunits: a small chain (gene purQ) which provides the GATase activity and a
   large chain (gene purL) which provides the aminator activity. The histidine amidotransferase
   hisH, an enzyme that catalyzes the fifth step in the biosynthesis of histidine in prokaryotes. </p>
  <p> [0503] In the second component of AS a cysteine has been shown [7] to be essential for the
   amidotransferase activity. The sequence around this residue is well conserved in all the above
   GATase domains and can be used as a signature pattern for class-I GATase. Consensus

  <p> 224. Glutathione peroxidases signatures (GSHPx) </p>
  <p>[0504] Glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9) (GSHPx) [1,2] is an enzyme that catalyzes the
   reduction of hydroxyperoxides by glutathione. Its main function is to protect against the
   damaging effect of endogenously formed hydroxyperoxides. In higher vertebrates at least four
   forms of GSHPx are known to exist: a ubiquitous cytosolic form (GSHPx-1), a gastrointestinal
   cytosolic for (GSHPx-GI) [3], a plasma secreted form (GSHPx-P) [4], and a epididymal secretory
   form (GSHPx-EP). In addition to these characterized forms, the sequence of a protein of unknown
   function [5] has been shown to be evolutionary related to those of GSHPx's. In filarial nematode
   parasites such as Brugia pahangi the major soluble cuticular protein, known as gp29, is a
   secreted GSHPx which could provide a mechanism of resistance to the immune reaction of the
   mammalian host by neutralizing the products of the oxidative burst of leukocytes [6].Escherichia
   coli protein btuE, a periplasmic protein involved in the transport of vitamin B12, is also
   evolutionary related to GSHPx's; the significance of this relationship is not yet clear.
   Selenium, in the form of selenocysteine [7] is part of the catalytic site of GSHPx. The sequence
   around the selenocysteine residue is moderately well conserved in GSHPx's and the related
   proteins and can be used as a signature pattern. As a second signature for this family of
   proteins a highly conserved octapeptide located in the central section of these proteins was
   selected. Consensus pattern: [GN]-[RKHNFYC]-x-[LIVMFC]-[LIVMF](2)-x-N-[VT]-x-[STC]-x-C-[GA]-x-T

  <p> 226. GTP1/OBG family signature </p>
  <p>[0506] A widespread family of GTP-binding proteins has been recently characterized [1,2]. This
   family currently includes: - Mouse and Xenopus protein DRG. - Human protein DRG2. - Drosophila
   protein 128up. - Fission yeast protein gtp1. - A Halobacterium cutirubrum hypothetical protein in
   a ribosomal protein gene cluster. - Bacillus subtilis protein obg. Obg has been experimentally
   shown to bind GTP. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhbZ. - Haemophilus influenzae
   hypothetical protein HI0877. - Mycoplasma genitalium hypothetical protein MG384. - Yeast
   hypothetical protein YAL036c (FUN11). - Yeast hypothetical protein YGR173w. - Caenorhabditis
   elegans hypothetical protein C02F5.3.The function of the proteins that belong to this family is
   not yet known. They are polypeptides of about 40 to 48 Kd which contain the five small sequence
   elements characteristic of GTP-binding proteins [3]. As a signature pattern the region that
   correspond to the ATP/GTP B motif (also called G-3 inGTP-binding proteins) was selected.

  <p> ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop) </p>
  <p>[0507] From sequence comparisons and crystallographic data analysis it has been shown
   [1,2,3,4,5,6] that an appreciable proportion of proteins that bind ATP or GTP share a number of
   more or less conserved sequence motifs. The best conserved of these motifs is a glycine-rich
   region, which typically forms a flexible loop between a beta-strand and an alpha-helix. This loop
   interacts with one of the phosphate groups of the nucleotide. This sequence motif is generally
   referred to as the 'A' consensus sequence [1] ] or the 'P-loop' [5].There are numerous ATP- or
   GTP-binding proteins in which the P-loop is found. Listed below are a number of protein families
   for which the relevance of the presence of such motif has been noted: - ATP synthase alpha and
   beta subunits (see &lt;PDOC00137&gt;). - Myosin heavy chains. - Kinesin heavy chains and
   kinesin-like proteins (see &lt;PDOC00343&gt;).- Dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (see
   &lt;PDOC00362&gt;). - Guanylate kinase (see &lt;PDOC00670&gt;). - Thymidine kinase (see
   &lt;PDOC00524&gt;). - Thymidylate kinase (see &lt;PDOC01034&gt;). - Shikimate kinase (see
   &lt;PDOC00868&gt;). - Nitrogenase iron protein family (nifH/frxC) (see &lt;PDOC00580&gt;). -
   ATP-binding proteins involved in 'active transport' (ABC transporters) [7] (see
   &lt;PDOC00185&gt;). - DNA and RNA helicases [8,9,10]. - GTP-binding elongation factors (EF-Tu,
   EF-1alpha, EF-G, EF-2, etc.). - Ras family of GTP-binding proteins (Ras, Rho, Rab, Ral, Ypt1,
   SEC4, etc.). - Nuclear protein ran (see &lt;PDOC00859&gt;).- ADP-ribosylation factors family (see
   &lt;PDOC00781&gt;).- Bacterial dnaA protein (see &lt;PDOC00771&gt;).- Bacterial recA protein (see
   &lt;PDOC00131&gt;). - Bacterial recF protein (see &lt;PDOC00539&gt;). - Guanine
   nucleotide-binding proteins alpha subunits (Gi, Gs, Gt, G0, etc.). - DNA mismatch repair proteins
   mutS family (See &lt;PDOC00388&gt;).- Bacterial type II secretion system protein E (see
   &lt;PDOC00567&gt;). Not all ATP- or GTP-binding proteins are picked-up by this motif. A number of
   proteins escape detection because the structure of their ATP-binding site is completely different
   from that of the P-loop. Examples of such proteins are the E1-E2 ATPases or the glycolytic
   kinases. In other ATP- or GTP-binding proteins the flexible loop exists in a slightly different
   form; this is the case for tubulins or protein kinases. A special mention must be reserved for
   adenylate kinase, in which there is a single deviation from the P-loop pattern: in the last
   position Gly is found instead of Ser or Thr. Consensus pattern: [AG]-x(4)-G-K-[ST]- [ 1] <ref type="npl">Walker

  <p> GTP-binding elongation factors signature (GTP_EFTU2) </p>
  <p>[0508] Elongation factors [1,2] are proteins catalyzing the elongation of peptide chains in
   protein biosynthesis. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, there are three distinct types of
   elongation factors, as described in the following table:
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Eukaryotes
   Prokaryotes Function ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   EF-1alpha EF-Tu Binds GTP and an aminoacyl-tRNA; delivers the latter to the A site of ribosomes.
   EF-1beta EF-Ts Interacts with EF-1a/EF-Tu to displace GDP and thus allows the regeneration of
   GTP-EF-1a. EF-2 EF-G Binds GTP and peptidyl-tRNA and translocates the latter from the A site to
   the P site. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------The
   GTP-binding elongation factor family also includes the following proteins: - Eukaryotic peptide
   chain release factor GTP-binding subunits [3]. These proteins interact with release factors that
   bind to ribosomes that have encountered a stop codon at their decoding site and help them to
   induce release of the nascent polypeptide. The yeast protein was known as SUP2 (and also as
   SUP35, SUF12 or GST1) and the human homolog as GST1-Hs. - Prokaryotic peptide chain release
   factor 3 (RF-3) (gene prfC). RF-3 is a class-II RF, a GTP-binding protein that interacts with
   class I RFs (see &lt;PDOC00607&gt;) and enhance their activity [4]. - Prokaryotic GTP-binding
   protein lepA and its homolog in yeast (gene GUF1) and in Caenorhabditis elegans (ZK1236.1). -
   Yeast HBS1 [5]. - Rat statin S1 [6], a protein of unknown function which is highly similar to
   EF-1alpha. - Prokaryotic selenocysteine-specific elongation factor selB [7], which seems to
   replace EF-Tu for the insertion of selenocysteine directed by the UGA codon. - The tetracycline
   resistance proteins tetM/tetO [8,9] from various bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni,
   Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Tetracycline binds to the
   prokaryotic ribosomal 30S subunit and inhibits binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs. These proteins abolish
   the inhibitory effect of tetracycline on protein synthesis. - Rhizobium nodulation protein nodQ
   [10]. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yihK [11].In EF-1-alpha, a specific region has been
   shown [12] to be involved in a conformational change mediated by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP.
   This region is conserved in both EF-1alpha/EF-Tu as well as EF-2/EF-G and thus seems typical for
   GTP-dependent proteins which bind non-initiator tRNAs to the ribosome. The pattern developed for
   this family of proteins include that conserved region. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0510] Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (EC 2.7.7.10) (galT) catalyzes the transfer of
   an uridyldiphosphate group on galactose (or glucose) 1-phosphate. During the reaction, the uridyl
   moiety links to a histidine residue. In the Escherichia coli enzyme, it has been shown [1] that
   two histidine residues separated by a single proline residue are essential for enzyme activity.
   On the basis of sequence similarities, two apparently unrelated families seem to exist. Class-I
   enzymes are found in eukaryotes as well as some bacteria such as Escherichia coli or Streptomyces
   lividans, while class-II enzymes have been found so far only in bacteria such as Bacillus
   subtilis or Lactobacillus helveticus [2]. Signature patterns for both families were developed.
   For class-I enzymes the signature is based on the active site residues. For class-II enzymes a
   region which also includes two conserved histidines was chosen. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 232. Germin family signature </p>
  <p>[0514] Germins [1] are a family of homopentameric cereal glycoproteins expressed during
   germination which may play a role in altering the properties of cell walls during germinative
   growth. It has been shown that wheat and barleygermins act as oxalate oxidases (EC 1.2.3.4), an
   enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative degradation of oxalate to carbonate and hydrogen peroxide.
   Germins are highly similar to: - Germin-like proteins from various plants such as rape, violet or
   white mustard. - Slime mold spherulins 1a and 1b which are proteins that accumulate specifically
   during spherulation, a process induced by various forms of environmental stress which leads to
   encystment and dormancy. As a signature pattern the best conserved region was selected: a
   decapeptide located in the central section of these proteins. Consensus pattern:

  <p> Glutamyl-tRNA reductase signature </p>
  <p>[0515] Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is the obligatory precursor for the synthesis of all
   tetrapyrroles including porphyrin derivatives such as chlorophyll and heme. ALA can be
   synthesized via two different pathways: the Shemin (or C4) pathway which involves the single step
   condensation of succinyl-CoA and glycine and which is catalyzed by ALA synthase (EC 2.3.1.37) and
   via the C5pathway from the five-carbon skeleton of glutamate. The C5 pathway operates in the
   chloroplast of plants and algae, in cyanobacteria, in some eubacteria and in archaebacteria. </p>
  <p>[0516] The initial step in the C5 pathway is carried out by glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) [1]
   which catalyzes the NADP-dependent conversion of glutamate- tRNA(Glu) to glutamate-1-semialdehyde
   (GSA) with the concomitant release of tRNA(Glu) which can then be recharged with glutamate by
   glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. </p>
  <p>[0517] GluTR is a protein of about 50 Kd (467 to 550 residues) which contains a few conserved
   region. The best conserved region is located in positions 99 to 122 in the sequence of known
   GluTR. This region seems important for the activity of the enzyme. We have developed a signature
   pattern from that conserved region. Consensus

   last specific step in the pathway for N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAC) utilization in bacteria such
   as Escherichia coli (gene nagB) or in fungi such as Candida albicans (gene NAG1).Glc-6-P

  <p>[0530] It has been shown [1,2] that the following glycosyl hydrolases can be classified into a

   3.2.1.39) (endo-(1-&gt;3)-beta- glucanase) from various plants. This enzyme may be involved in
   the defense of plants against pathogens through its ability to degrade fungal cell wall
   polysaccharides. - Glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.58) (exo-(1-&gt;3)-beta-glucanase) from
   yeast (gene BGL2). This enzyme may play a role in cell expansion during growth, in cell-cell

  <p>[0531] Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) (lactoylglutathione lyase) catalyzes the first step of the
   glyoxal pathway, the transformation of methylglyoxal and glutathioneinto S-lactoylglutathione
   which is then converted by glyoxalase II to lactic acid [1]. Glyoxalase I is an ubiquitous enzyme
   which binds one mole of zinc per subunit. The bacterial and yeast enzymes are monomeric while the
   mammalian one is homodimeric. The sequence of glyoxalase I is well conserved. In bacteria and
   mammals, the enzyme is a protein of about 130 to 180 residues while in fungi it is about twice
   longer. In these organisms the enzyme is built out of the tandem repeat of an homologous domain.
   Two signature patterns for this family were derived. The first one is located in the N-terminal

   of three separate domains: a) A signal sequence; b) An extracellular domain of about 500 residues
   that contains 12 conserved cysteines probably involved in disulfide bonds and which also contains
   the sites of attachment of the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan side chains; c) A C-terminal

  <p> 246. Granins signatures </p>
  <p>[0535] Granins (chromogranins or secretogranins) [1] are a family of acidic proteins present in
   the secretory granules of a wide variety of endocrine and neuro-endocrine cells. The exact
   function(s) of these proteins is not yet known but they seem to be the precursors of biologically
   active peptides and/or they may act as helper proteins in the packaging of peptide hormones and
   neuropeptides. Three members of this family of proteins show some sequence similarities: -
   Chromogranin A (CGA) [2]. CGA is a protein of about 420 residues; it is the precursor of the
   peptide pancreastatin which strongly inhibits glucose- induced insulin release from the pancreas.
   - Secretogranin 1 (chromogranin B). A sulfated protein of about 600 residues. - Secretogranin 2
   (chromogranin C). A sulfated protein of about 650 residues. Apart from their subcellular location
   and the abundance of acidic residues(Asp and Glu), these proteins do not share many structural
   similarities. Only one short region, located in the C-terminal section, is conserved in all these
   proteins. Chromogranins A and B share a region of high similarity in their N-terminal section;
   this region includes two cysteine residues involved in a disulfide bond Consensus pattern:

   recycle more efficiently. GrpE is a protein of about 22 to 25 Kd. In yeast, an evolutionary

  <p> 248. Guanylate kinase signature and profile </p>
  <p>[0537] Guanylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.8) (GK) [1] catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of
   GMP into GDP. It is essential for recycling GMP and indirectly, cGMP. In prokaryotes (such as
   Escherichia coli), lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) and in vertebrates, GK is a highly conserved
   monomeric protein of about 200 amino acids. GK has been shown [2,3,4] to be structurally similar
   to the following proteins: - Protein A57R (or SalG2R) from various strains of Vaccinia virus.
   This protein is highly similar to GK, but contains a frameshift mutation in the N-terminal
   section and could therefore be inactive in that virus. The following proteins are characterized
   by the presence in their sequence of one or more copies of the DHR domain, a SH3 domain (see
   &lt;PDOC50002&gt; as well as a C-terminal GK-like domain, these protein are collectively termed
   MAGUKs (membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs) [5]: - Drosophila lethal(1)discs large-1
   tumor suppressor protein (gene dlg1). This protein is associated with septate junctions in
   developing flies and defects in the dlg1 gene cause neoplastic overgrowth of the imaginal disks.
   - Mammalian tight junction protein Zo-1.- A family of mammalian synaptic proteins that seem to
   interact with the cytoplasmic tail of NMDA receptor subunits. This family currently consist of
   SAP90/PSD-95, CHAPSYN-110/PSD-93, SAP97/DLG1 and SAP102. - Vertebrate 55 Kd erythrocyte membrane
   protein (p55). p55 is a palmitoylated, membrane-associated protein of unknown function. -
   Caenorhabditis elegans protein lin-2, which may play a structural role in the induction of the
   vulva. - Rat protein CASK. - Human protein DLG2.- Human protein DLG3.There is an ATP-binding site
   (P-loop) in the N-terminal section of GK. This region is not conserved in the GK-like domain of
   the above proteins which are therefore unlikely to be kinases. However these proteins retain the
   residues known, in GK, to be involved in the binding of GMP. As a signature pattern a highly
   conserved region was selected that contains two arginine and a tyrosine which are involved in
   GMP-binding Consensus pattern: T-[ST]-R-x(2)-[KR]-x(2)-[DE]-x(2)-G-x(2)-Y-x-[FY]-[LIVMK]- [ 1]

   [4,E1]. The enzymes which are currently known to belong to this family are listed below.

  <p> 260. Glutamine synthetase signatures (GLN-SYNT) </p>
  <p>[0563] Glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) (GS) [1] plays an essential role in the metabolism of
   nitrogen by catalyzing the condensation of glutamate and ammonia to form glutamine. There seem to
   be three different classes of GS [2,3,4]: - Class I enzymes (GSI) are specific to prokaryotes,
   and are oligomers of 12 identical subunits. The activity of GSI-type enzyme is controlled by the
   adenylation of a tyrosine residue. The adenylated enzyme is inactive. - Class II enzymes (GSII)
   are found in eukaryotes and in bacteria belonging to the Rhizobiaceae, Frankiaceae, and
   Streptomycetaceae families (these bacteria have also a class-I GS). GSII are octamer of identical
   subunits. Plants have two or more isozymes of GSII, one of the isozymes is translocated into the
   chloroplast. - Class III enzymes (GSIII) has, currently, only been found in Bacteroides fragilis
   and in butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. It is a hexamer of identical chains. It is much larger (about
   700 amino acids) than the GSI (450 to 470 amino acids) or GSII (350 to 420 amino acids) enzymes.
   While the three classes of GS's are clearly structurally related, the sequence similarities are
   not so extensive. As signature patterns three conserved regions were selected. The first pattern
   is based on a conserved tetrapeptide in the N-terminal section of the enzyme, the second one is
   based on a glycine-rich region which is thought to be involved in ATP-binding. The third pattern
   is specific to class I glutamine synthetases and includes the tyrosine residue which is
   reversibly adenylated. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 261. Globins profile (globin1) </p>
  <p>[0564] Globins are heme-containing proteins involved in binding and/or transporting oxygen [1].
   They belong to a very large and well studied family which is widely distributed in many
   organisms. The major groups of globins are: - Hemoglobins (Hb) from vertebrates. Hb is the
   protein responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to other tissues. It is a tetramer of
   two alpha and two beta chains. Most vertebrate species also express specific embryonic or fetal
   forms of hemoglobin where the alpha or the beta chains are replaced by a chain with higher oxygen
   affinity, as for the gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta chains in mammals, for example. - Myoglobins
   (Mg) from vertebrates. Mg is a monomeric protein responsible for oxygen storage in muscles. -
   Invertebrate globins [2]. A wide variety of globins are found in invertebrates. Molluscs
   generally have one or two muscle globins which are either monomeric or dimeric. Insects, such as
   the midge Chironomus thummi, have a large set of extracellular globins. Nematodes and annelids
   have a variety of intracellular and extracellular globins; some of them are multi- domain
   polypeptides (from two up to nine-domain globins) and some produce large, disulfide-bonded
   aggregates. - Leghemoglobins (Lg) from the root nodules of leguminous plants. Lg provides oxygen
   for bacteroids. - Flavohemoproteins from bacteria (Escherichia coli hmpA) and fungi [3]. These
   proteins consist of two distinct domains: an N-terminal globin domain and a C-terminal
   FAD-containing reductase domain. In bacteria such as Vitreoscilla, the enzyme-associated globin
   is a single domain protein. All these globins seem to have evolved from a common ancestor. The
   profile developed to detect members of the globin family is based on a structural alignment of
   selected globin sequences [ 1] <ref type="book">Concise Encyclopedia Biochemistry, Second Edition, Walter de

  <p> Plant hemoglobins signature (globin2) </p>
  <p>[0565] Leghemoglobins [1] are hemoproteins present in the root nodules of leguminousplants.
   Leghemoglobins are structurally and functionally related to hemoglobin and myoglobin. By
   providing oxygen to the bacteroids, they are essential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation.
   Structurally related hemoglobins from the nodules of non-leguminous plants [2,3], and from the
   roots of non-nodulating plants[4] have been recently sequenced. A signature pattern was developed
   that picks up the sequence of plants hemoglobins, exclusively. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0566] Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase [1,2] is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the
   reversible aldol cleavage or condensation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into
   dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.There are two classes of
   fructose-bisphosphate aldolases with different catalytic mechanisms. Class-I aldolases [3],
   mainly found in higher eukaryotes, are homotetrameric enzymes which form a Schiff-base
   intermediate between the C-2 carbonyl group of the substrate (dihydroxyacetone phosphate)and the
   epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue. In vertebrates, three forms of this enzyme are found:
   aldolase A in muscle, aldolase B in liver and aldolase C in brain. The sequence around the lysine
   involved in the Schiff-base is highly conserved and can be used as a signature for this class of
   enzyme. Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-x-[LIVMFYW]-E-G-x-[LS]-L-K-P-[SN] [K is involved in Schiff-base

  <p>[0569] It has been shown [1 to 4] that the following glycosyl hydrolases can be, on the basis
   of sequence similarities, classified into a single family: - Beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) from
   various bacteria such as Agrobacterium strain ATCC 21400, Bacillus polymyxa, and Caldocellum
   saccharolyticum. - Two plants (clover) beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21). - Two different
   beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23) from the archaebacteria Sulfolobus solfataricus (genes bgaS and
   lacS). - 6-phospho-beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.85) from various bacteria such as Lactobacillus
   casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Staphylococcus aureus. - 6-phosphobeta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.86)
   from Escherichia coli (genes bglB and ascB) and from Erwinia chrysanthemi (gene arbB). - Plants
   myrosinases (EC 3.2.3.1) (sinigrinase) (thioglucosidase). - Mammalian lactase-phlorizin hydrolase
   (LPH) (EC 3.2.1.108 / EC 3.2.1.62). LPH, an integral membrane glycoprotein, is the enzyme that
   splits lactose in the small intestine. LPH is a large protein of about 1900 residues which
   contains four tandem repeats of a domain of about 450 residues which is evolutionary related to
   the above glycosyl hydrolases. One of the conserved regions in these enzymes is centered on a
   conserved glutamic acid residue which has been shown [5], in the beta-glucosidase from
   Agrobacterium, to be directly involved in glycosidic bond cleavage by acting as a nucleophile.
   This region was used as a signature pattern. As a second signature pattern a conserved region was
   selected, found in the N-terminal extremity of these enzymes, this region also contains a
   glutamic acid residue. Consensus pattern:
   [LIVMFSTC]-[LIVFYS]-[LIV]-[LIVMST]-E-N-G-[LIVMFAR]-[CSAGN] [E is the active site residue] Note:
   this pattern will pick up the last two domains of LPH; the first two domains, which are removed
   from the LPH precursor by proteolytic processing, have lost the active site glutamate and may
   therefore be inactive [4]. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0572] The microbial degradation of cellulose and xylans requires several types of enzymes such

   xylanases which, on the basis of sequence similarities, can be classified into families. One of
   these families is known as the cellulase family D [3] or as the glycosyl hydrolases family 8

  <p>[0578] Recently a family of small proteins of about 12 to 16 Kd has been described[1]. This
   family currently consists of: - Mammalian protein HINT (also known as Protein kinase C inhibitor
   1 or PKCI- 1). HINT was incorrectly thought to be a specific inhibitor of PKC. It has been shown
   to bind zinc. - Fission yeast diadenosine 5',5&quot;'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate asymmetrical hydrolase
   (Ap4Aase) (EC 3.6.1.17) [2] (gene aphl), which cleaves A-5'-PPPP- 5'A to yield AMP and ATP. -
   FHIT, a human protein whose gene is altered in different tumors and which acts [3] as a
   diadenosine 5',5&quot;'-P1,P3-triphosphate hydrolase (Ap3Aase) (EC 3.6.1.29) cleaving
   A-5'-PPP-5'A to yield AMP and ADP. - Yeast proteins HNT1 and HNT2. - Maize zinc-binding protein

   protein in psbAII 5'region in Synechococcus strain PCC 7942.All these proteins contains a region
   with three clustered histidines. This region is responsible for the designation of this family:
   HIT, for 'HIstidine Triad [1]. This region was originally thought to be implied in the binding of
   a zinc ion but was later identified [4] as part of the alpha-phosphate binding site of a
   nucleotide-binding domain. As a signature pattern, the region of the histidine triad was
   selected. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 275. Myc-type, 'helix-loop-helix' dimerization domain signature (HLH) </p>
  <p>[0579] A number of eukaryotic proteins, which probably are sequence specific DNA-binding
   proteins that act as transcription factors, share a conserved domain of 40 to 50 amino acid
   residues. It has been proposed [1] that this domain is formed of two amphipathic helices joined
   by a variable length linker region that could form a loop. This 'helix-loop-helix' (HLH) domain
   mediates protein dimerization and has been found in the proteins listed below [2,3,E1,E2]. Most
   of these proteins have an extra basic region of about 15 amino acid residues that is adjacent to
   the HLH domain and specifically binds to DNA. They are refered as basic helix-loop-helix proteins
   (bHLH), and are classified in two groups: class A (ubiquitous) and class B (tissue-specific).
   Members of the bHLH family bind variations on the core sequence 'CANNTG', also referred to as the
   E-box motif. The homo- or heterodimerization mediated by the HLH domain is independent of, but
   necessary for DNA binding, as two basic regions are required for DNA binding activity. The HLH
   proteins lacking the basic domain (Emc, Id) function as negative regulators since they form
   heterodimers, but fail to bind DNA. The hairy-related proteins (hairy, E(spl), deadpan) also
   repress transcription although they can bind DNA. The proteins of this subfamily act together
   with co-repressor proteins, like groucho, through their C-terminal motif WRPW. - The myc family
   of cellular oncogenes [4], which is currently known to contain four members: c-myc [E3], N-myc,
   L-myc, and B-myc. The myc genes are thought to play a role in cellular differentiation and
   proliferation. - Proteins involved in myogenesis (the induction of muscle cells). In mammals
   MyoD1 (Myf-3), myogenin (Myf-4), Myf-5, and Myf-6 (Mrf4 or herculin), in birds CMD1 (QMF-1), in
   Xenopus MyoD and MF25, in Caenorhabditis elegans CeMyoD, and in Drosophila nautilus (nau). -
   Vertebrate proteins that bind specific DNA sequences ('E boxes') in various immunoglobulin chains
   enhancers: E2A or ITF-1 (E12/pan-2 and E47/pan-1), ITF-2 (tcf4), TFE3, and TFEB. - Vertebrate
   neurogenic differentiation factor 1 that acts as differentiation factor during neurogenesis. -
   Vertebrate MAX protein, a transcription regulator that forms a sequence- specific DNA-binding
   protein complex with myc or mad. - Vertebrate Max Interacting Protein 1 (MXI1 protein) which acts
   as a transcriptional repressor and may antagonize myc transcriptional activity by competing for
   max. - Proteins of the bHLH/PAS superfamily which are transcriptional activators. In mammals, AH
   receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), single-minded homologs (SIM 1 and SIM2), hypoxia-inducible
   factor 1 alpha (HIF1A), AH receptor (AHR), neuronal pas domain proteins (NPAS1 and NPAS2),
   endothelial pas domain protein 1 (EPAS1), mouse ARNT2, and human BMAL1. In drosophila,
   single-minded (SIM), AH receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), trachealess protein (TRH), and
   similar protein (SIMA). - Mammalian transcription factors HES, which repress transcription by
   acting on two types of DNA sequences, the E box and the N box. - Mammalian MAD protein (max
   dimerizer) which acts as transcriptional repressor and may antagonize myc transcriptional
   activity by competing for max. - Mammalian Upstream Stimulatory Factor 1 and 2 (USF1 and USF2),
   which bind to a symmetrical DNA sequence that is found in a variety of viral and cellular
   promoters. - Human lyl-1 protein; which is involved, by chromosomal translocation, in T- cell
   leukemia. - Human transcription factor AP-4. - Mouse helix-loop-helix proteins MATH-1 and MATH-2
   which activate E box- dependent transcription in collaboration with E47. - Mammalian stem cell
   protein (SCL) (also known as tall), a protein which may play an important role in hemopoietic
   differentiation. SCL is involved, by chromosomal translocation, in stem-cell leukemia. -
   Mammalian proteins Id1 to Id4 [5]. Id (inhibitor of DNA binding) proteins lack a basic
   DNA-binding domain but are able to form heterodimers with other HLH proteins, thereby inhibiting
   binding to DNA. - Drosophila extra-macrochaetae (emc) protein, which participates in sensory
   organ patterning by antagonizing the neurogenic activity of the achaete- scute complex. Emc is
   the homolog of mammalian Id proteins. - Human Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1
   (SREBP-1), a transcriptional activator that binds to the sterol regulatory element 1 (SRE-1)
   found in the flanking region of the LDLR gene and in other genes. - Drosophila achaete-scute

  <p>[0580] High mobility group (HMG) proteins are a family of relatively low molecular weight
   nonhistone components in chromatin. HMG14 and HMG17 [1], two related proteins of about 100 amino
   acid residues, bind to the inner side of the nucleosomal DNA thus altering the interaction
   between the DNA and the histone octamer. These two proteins may be involved in the process which
   maintains transcribable genes in a unique chromatin conformation. The trout nonhistone
   chromosomal protein H6 (histone T) also belongs to this family. As a signature pattern a
   conserved stretch of 10 residues located in the N-terminal section of HMG14 and HMG17 was

  <p> 281. Heat shock hsp20 proteins family profile </p>
  <p>[0585] Prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms respond to heat shock or other environmental stress
   by inducing the synthesis of proteins collectively known as heat-shock proteins (hsp) [1].
   Amongst them is a family of proteins with an average molecular weight of 20 Kd, known as the
   hsp20 proteins [2 to 5]. These seem to act as chaperones that can protect other proteins against
   heat-induced denaturation and aggregation. Hsp20 proteins seem to form large heterooligomeric
   aggregates; their family is currently composed of the following members: - Vertebrate heat shock
   protein hsp27 (hsp25), induced by a variety of environmental stresses. - Drosophila heat shock
   proteins hsp22, hsp23, hsp26, hsp27, hsp67BA and BC. - Caenorhabditis elegans hspl6 multigene
   family. - Fungal HSP26 (budding yeast) and hsp30 (Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus Nidulans). -
   Plant small hsp's. Plants have four classes of hsp20: classes I and II which are cytoplasmic,
   class III which is chloroplastic and class IV which is found in the endomembrane. -
   Alpha-crystallin A and B chains. Alpha-crystallin is an abundant constituent of the eye lens of
   most vertebrate species. Its main function appears to be to maintain the correct refractive index
   of the lens. It is also found in other tissues where it seems to act as a chaperone [6]. -
   Schistosoma mansoni major egg antigen p40. Structurally, p40 is built of two tandem hsp20
   domains. - A variety of prokaryotic proteins: ibpA and ibpB from Escherichia coli, hsp 18 from
   Clostridium acetobutylicum, spore protein SP21 (hspA) from Stigmatella aurantiaca, Mycobacterium
   leprae 18 Kd antigen and Mycobacterium tuberculosis 14 Kd antigen. - Methanococcus jannaschii
   hypothetical protein MJ0285.Structurally, this family is characterized by the presence of a
   conserved C-terminal domain of about 100 residues. The profile developed to detect members of the
   hsp20 family is based on an alignment of this domain. Sequences known to belong to this class
   detected by the profile: ALL. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Lindquist S., Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 22:631-677(1988)</ref>. [

  <p> 282. Heat shock hsp70 proteins family signatures </p>
  <p>[0586] Prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms respond to heat shock or other environmental stress
   by the induction of the synthesis of proteins collectively known as heat-shock proteins (hsp)
   [1]. Amongst them is a family of proteins with an average molecular weight of 70 Kd, known as the
   hsp70proteins [2,3,4]. In most species, there are many proteins that belong to the hsp70 family.
   Some of them are expressed under unstressed conditions. Hsp70proteins can be found in different
   cellular compartments (nuclear, cytosolic, mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, etc.). Some of
   the hsp70 family proteinsare listed below: - In Escherichia coli and other bacteria, the main
   hsp70 protein is known as the dnaK protein. A second protein, hscA, has been recently discovered.
   dnaK is also found in the chloroplast genome of red algae. - In yeast, at least ten hsp70
   proteins are known to exist: SSA1 to SSA4, SSB1, SSB2, SSC1, SSD1 (KAR2), SSE1 (MSI3) and SSE2. -
   In Drosophila, there are at least eight different hsp70 proteins: HSP70, HSP68, and HSC-1 to
   HSC-6. - In mammals, there are at least eight different proteins: HSPA1 to HSPA6, HSC70, and
   GRP78 (also known as the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP)). - In the sugar beet
   yellow virus (SBYV), a hsp70 homolog has been shown [5] to exist. - In archaebacteria, hsp70
   proteins are also present [6].All proteins belonging to the hsp70 family bind ATP. A variety of
   functions has been postulated for hsp70 proteins. It now appears [7] that some hsp70proteins play
   an important role in the transport of proteins across membranes. They also seem to be involved in
   protein folding and in the assembly/disassembly of protein complexes [8]. Three signature
   patterns for the hsp70 family of proteins were derived; the first centered on a conserved
   pentapeptide found in the N-terminal section of these proteins; the two others on conserved
   regions located in the central part of the sequence. Consensus pattern: [IV]-D-L-G-T-[ST]-x-[SC]

  <p>[0587] Prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms respond to heat shock or other environmental stress
   by the induction of the synthesis of proteins collectively known as heat-shock proteins (hsp)
   [1]. Amongst them is a family of proteins, with an average molecular weight of 90 Kd, known as
   the hsp90proteins. Proteins known to belong to this family are: - Escherichia coli and other
   bacteria heat shock protein c62.5 (gene htpG). - Vertebrate hsp 90-alpha (hsp 86) and hsp 90-beta
   (hsp 84). - Drosophila hsp 82 (hsp 83). - Trypanosoma cruzi hsp 85. - Plants Hsp82 or Hsp83. -
   Yeast and other fungi HSC82, and HSP82. - The endoplasmic reticulum protein 'endoplasmin' (also
   known as Erp99 in mouse, GRP94 in hamster, and hsp 108 in chicken).The exact function of hsp90
   proteins is not yet known. In higher eukaryotes, hsp90 has been found associated with steroid
   hormone receptors, with tyrosine kinase oncogene products of several retroviruses, with eIF2alpha
   kinase, and with actin and tubulin. Hsp90 are probable chaperonins that possess ATPase activity
   [2,3].As a signature pattern for the hsp90 family of proteins, a highly conserved region found in

  <p> 285. Heme oxygenase signature </p>
  <p>[0589] Heme oxygenase (EC 1.14.99.3) (HO) [1] is the microsomal enzyme that, in animals,
   carries out the oxidation of heme, it cleaves the heme ring at the alpha methene bridge to form
   biliverdin and carbon monoxide. Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin
   reductase. In mammals there are three isozymes of heme oxygenase: HO-1 to HO-3. The first two
   isozymes differ in their tissue expression and their inducibility: HO-1 is highly inducible by
   its substrate heme and by various non-heme substances, while HO-2 is non-inducible. It has been
   suggested [2] that HO-2 could be implicated in the production of carbon monoxide in the brain
   where it is said to act as a neurotransmitter.In the genome of the chloroplast of red algae as
   well as in cyanobacteria, there is a heme oxygenase (gene pbsA) that is the key enzyme in the
   synthesis of the chromophoric part of the photosynthetic antennae [3]. An heme oxygenase is also
   present in the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae (gene hmuO), where it is involved in the
   acquisition of iron from the host heme [4].There is, in the central section of these enzymes, a
   well conserved region centered on a histidine residue which is proposed to play a key role in
   binding the substrate heme at the active center of the enzyme. This region was used as a
   signature pattern. Consensus pattern: L-[IV]-A-H-[STACH]-Y-[STV]-[RT]-Y-[LIVM]-G [H binds the

   biosynthesis; and in plants it is expressed as nuclear encoded protein precursor which is
   exported to the chloroplast [1].As a signature pattern a highly conserved region located in the

   from aspartate to homoserine. The latter participates in the biosynthesis of threonine and then
   isoleucine as well as in that of methionine. HDh is found either as a single chain protein as in
   some bacteria and yeast, or as a bifunctional enzyme consisting of an N-terminal aspartokinase
   domain and a C-terminal HDh domain as in bacteria such as Escherichia coli and in plants. As a

  <p>[0598] Cytochrome b5 is a membrane-bound hemo protein which acts as an electron carrier for
   several membrane-bound oxygenases [1]. There are two homologous forms of b5, one found in
   microsomes and one found in the outer membrane of mitochondria. Two conserved histidine residues
   serve as axial ligands for the heme group. The structure of a number of oxidoreductases consists
   of the juxtaposition of a heme-binding domain homologous to that of b5 and either a
   flavodehydrogenase or a molybdopterin domain. These enzymes are: Lactate dehydrogenase (EC
   1.1.2.3) [2], an enzyme that consists of a flavodehydrogenase domain and a heme-binding domain
   called cytochrome b2. Nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1), a key enzyme involved in the first step of
   nitrate assimilation in plants, fungi and bacteria [3,4]. Consists of a molybdopterin domain (see
   &lt;PDOC00484&gt;), a heme-binding domain called cytochrome b557, as well as a cytochrome
   reductase domain. Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) [5], which catalyzes the terminal reaction in the
   oxidative degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids. Also consists of a molybdopterin domain
   and a heme-binding domain. This family of proteins also includes: TU-36B, a Drosophila muscle

  <p> 295. Hexokinases signature. </p>
  <p>[0601] Hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) [1,2] is an important glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the
   phosphorylation of keto- and aldohexoses (e.g. glucose, mannose and fructose) using MgATP as the
   phosphoryl donor. In vertebrates there are four major isoenzymes, commonly referred as types
   I,II, III and IV. Type IV hexokinase, which is often incorrectly designated glucokinase [3], is
   only expressed in liver and pancreatic beta-cells and plays an important role in modulating
   insulin secretion; it is a protein of a molecular mass of about 50 Kd. Hexokinases of types I to
   III, which have low Km values for glucose, have a molecular mass of about 100 Kd. Structurally
   they consist of a very small N-terminal hydrophobic membrane-binding domain followed by two
   highly similar domains of 450 residues. The first domain has lost its catalytic activity and has
   evolved into a regulatory domain. In yeast there are three different isozymes: hexokinase PI
   (gene HXK1), PII(gene HXKB), and glucokinase (gene GLK1). All three proteins have a molecular
   mass of about 50 Kd. All these enzymes contain one (or two in the case of types I to III
   isozymes)strongly conserved region which has been shown [4] to be involved in substrate binding.

  <p> 297. 'Homeobox' domain signature and profile (home1) </p>
  <p>[0606] The 'homeobox' is a protein domain of 60 amino acids [1 to 5.E1] first identified in a
   number of Drosophila homeotic and segmentation proteins. It has since been found to be extremely
   well conserved in many other animals, including vertebrates. This domain binds DNA through a
   helix-turn-helix type of structure. Some of the proteins which contain a homeobox domain play an
   important role in development. Most of these proteins are known to be sequence specific
   DNA-binding transcription factors. The homeobox domain has also been found to be very similar to
   a region of the yeast mating type proteins. These are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that
   act as master switches in yeast differentiation by controlling gene expression in a cell
   type-specific fashion. A schematic representation of the homeobox domain is shown below. The
   helix-turn-helix region is shown by the symbols 'H' (for helix), and 't' (for turn).

  <p> 'Homeobox' antennapedia-type protein signature (home2) </p>
  <p>[0607] The homeotic Hox proteins are sequence-specific transcription factors. They are part of
   a developmental regulatory system that provides cells with specific positional identities on the
   anterior-posterior (A-P) axis [1]. The hox proteins contain a 'homeobox' domain. In Drosophila
   and other insects, there are eight different Hox genes that are encoded in two gene complexes,
   ANT-C and BX-C. In vertebrates there are 38 genes organized in four complexes. In six of the
   eight Drosophila Hox genes the homeobox domain is highly similar and a conserved hexapeptide is
   found five to sixteen amino acids upstream of the homeobox domain. The six Drosophila proteins
   that belong to this group are antennapedia (Antp), abdominal-A (abd-A), deformed (Dfd),
   proboscipedia (pb),sex combs reduced (scr) and ultrabithorax (ubx) and are collectively known as
   the 'antennapedia' subfamily. In vertebrates the corresponding Hox genes are known [2] as Hox-A2,
   A3, A4,A5, A6, A7, Hox-B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, Hox-C4, C5, C6, C8, Hox-D1,D3, D4 and
   D8.Caenorhabditis elegans lin-39 and mab-5 are also members of the 'antennapedia' subfamily. As a
   signature pattern for this subfamily of homeobox proteins, the conserved hexapeptide was used.

   Proteins currently known to belong to the engrailed subfamily are: - Drosophila segmentation
   polarity protein engrailed (en) which specifies the body segmentation pattern and is required for
   the development of the central nervous system. - Drosophila invected protein (inv). - Silk moth

  <p>[0612] Imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.19) is the enzyme that catalyzes the
   seventh step in the biosynthesis of histidine in bacteria, fungi and plants. In most organisms it
   is a monofunctional protein of about 22 to29 Kd. In some bacteria such as Escherichia coli it is
   the C-terminal domain of a bifunctional protein that include a histidinol-phosphatase domain [1].
   Two signature patterns were developed that each include two consecutive histidine residues.

  <p> 302. Indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase signature ( IGPS) </p>
  <p>[0613] Indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (EC 4.1.1.48) (IGPS) catalyzes the fourth step in
   the biosynthesis of tryptophan: the ring closure of 1-(2-carboxy-phenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose
   into indol-3-glycerol-phosphate.In some bacteria, IGPS is a single chain enzyme. In others - such
   as Escherichia coli - it is the N-terminal domain of a bifunctional enzyme that also catalyzes
   N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate isomerase (PRAI) activity, the third step of tryptophan
   biosynthesis. In fungi, IGPS is the central domain of a trifunctional enzyme that also contains a
   PRAI C-terminal domain and a glutamine amidotransferase N-terminal domain. The N-terminal section
   of IGPS contains a highly conserved region which X-ray crystallography studies [1] have shown to
   be part of the active site cavity. This region was used as a signature pattern for IGPS.

   6-phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjhG. Both

   developed as signature patterns. The first pattern is located in the N-terminal part and contains

  <p> 305. IMP dehydrogenase / GMP reductase signature </p>
  <p>[0615] IMP dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.205) (IMPDH) catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction of de novo
   GTP biosynthesis, the NAD-dependent reduction of IMP into XMP [1].Inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase
   activity results in the cessation of DNA synthesis. As IMP dehydrogenase is associated with cell
   proliferation, it is a possible target for cancer chemotherapy. Mammalian and bacterial IMPDHs
   are tetramers of identical chains. There are two IMP dehydrogenase isozymes in humans [2].GMP
   reductase (EC 1.6.6.8) catalyzes the irreversible and NADPH-dependent reductive deamination of
   GMP into IMP [3]. It converts nucleobase, nucleoside and nucleotide derivatives of G to A
   nucleotides, and maintains intracellular balance of A and G nucleotides. IMP dehydrogenase and
   GMP reductase share many regions of sequence similarity. One of these regions is centered on a
   cysteine residue thought [3] to be involved in binding IMP. This region was used as a signature
   pattern. Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-[RK]-[LIVM]-G-[LIVM]-G-x-G-S-[LIVM]-C-x-T [C is the putative

  <p> 308. Inosine-uridine preferring nucleoside hydrolasefamily signature (IU nuc hydro) </p>
  <p>[0618] Inosine-uridine preferring nucleoside hydrolase (EC 3.2.2.1) (IU-nucleosidehydrolase or
   IUNH) is an enzyme first identified in protozoan [1] that catalyzes the hydrolysis of all of the
   commonly occuring purine and pyrimidine nucleosides into ribose and the associated base, but has
   a preference for inosine and uridine as substrates. This enzyme is important for these parasitic
   organisms, which are deficient in de novo synthsis of purines, to salvage the host purine
   nucleosides. IUNH from Crithidia fasciculata has been sequenced and characterized, it is an
   homotetrameric enzyme of subunits of 34 Kd. An histidine has been shown to be important for the
   catalytic mechanism, it acts a proton donor to activate the hypoxanthine leaving group. IUNH is
   evolutionary related to a number of uncharacterized proteins from various biological sources,
   notably: - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yaaF. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein
   ybeK. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yeiK. - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC
   1768.02. - Yeast hypothetical protein YDR400w. - An hypothetical protein from the archaebacteria
   Desulfurolobus ambivalens. As a signature pattern for these proteins, a highly conserved region
   was selected located in the N-terminal extremity. This region contains four conserved aspartates
   that have been shown [2] to be located in the active site cavity. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 309. (Insulinase) </p>
  <p>[0619] Insulinase family, zinc-binding region signature (aka Peptidase_M16) </p>
  <p>[0620] A number of proteases dependent on divalent cations for their activity have been shown
   [1,2] to belong to one family, on the basis of sequence similarity. These enzymes are listed
   below. Insulinase (EC 3.4.24.56) (also known as insulysin or insulin-degrading enzyme or IDE), a
   cytoplasmic enzyme which seems to be involved in the cellular processing of insulin, glucagon and
   other small polypeptides. Escherichia coli protease III (EC 3.4.24.55) (pitrilysin) (gene ptr), a
   periplasmic enzyme that degrades small peptides. Mitochondrial processing peptidase (EC
   3.4.24.64) (MPP). This enzyme removes the transit peptide from the precursor form of proteins
   imported from the cytoplasm across the mitochondrial inner membrane. It is composed of two
   nonidentical homologous subunits termed alpha and beta. The beta subunit seems to be
   catalytically active while the alpha subunit has probably lost its activity. Nardilysin (EC
   3.4.24.61) (N-arginine dibasic convertase or NRD convertase) this mammalian enzyme cleaves
   peptide substrates on the N-terminus of Arg residues in dibasic stretches. Klebsiella pneumoniae
   protein pqqF. This protein is required for the biosynthesis of the coenzyme
   pyrrolo-quinoline-quinone (PQQ). It is thought to be protease that cleaves peptide bonds in a
   small peptide (gene pqqA) thus providing the glutamate and tyrosine residues necessary for the
   synthesis of PQQ. Yeast protein AXL1, which is involved in axial budding [3]. Eimeria bovis
   sporozoite developmental protein. Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yddC and HI1368, the
   corresponding Haemophilus influenzae protein. Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ymxG.
   Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C28F5.4 and F56D2.1. </p>
  <p>[0621] It should be noted that in addition to the above enzymes, this family also includes the
   core proteins I and II of the mitochondrial bc1 complex (also called cytochrome c reductase or
   complex III), but the situation as to the activity or lack of activity of these subunits is quite
   complex: In mammals and yeast, core proteins I and II lack enzymatic activity. In Neurospora
   crassa and in potato core protein I is equivalent to the beta subunit of MPP. In Euglena
   gracilis, core protein I seems to be active, while subunit II is inactive. </p>
  <p>[0622] These proteins do not share many regions of sequence similarity; the most noticeable is
   in the N-terminal section. This region includes a conserved histidine followed, two residues
   later by a glutamate and another histidine. In pitrilysin, it has been shown [4] that this
   H-x-x-E-H motif is involved in enzyme activity; the two histidines bind zinc and the glutamate is
   necessary for catalytic activity. Non active members of this family have lost from one to three
   of these active site residues. We developed a signature pattern that detect active members of
   this family as well as some inactive members. Consensus pattern

  <p> 312. Inositol monophosphatase family signatures (inositol_P) </p>
  <p>[0625] It has been shown [1] that several proteins share two sequence motifs. Two of these
   proteins are enzymes of the inositol phosphate second messenger signaling pathway: - Vertebrate
   and plants inositol monophosphatase (EC 3.1.3.25). - Vertebrate inositol polyphosphate
   1-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.57).The function of the other proteins is not yet clear: - Bacterial
   protein cysQ. CysQ could help to control the pool of PAPS (3'-phosphoadenoside
   5'-phosphosulfate), or be useful in sulfite synthesis. - Escherichia coli protein suhB. Mutations
   in suhB results in the enhanced synthesis of heat shock sigma factor (htpR). - Neurospora crassa
   protein Qa-X. Probably involved in quinate metabolism. - Emericella nidulans protein qutG.

   enhancing the synthesis or degradation of phosphorylated messenger molecules. From the X-ray
   structure of human inositol monophosphatase [3], it seems that some of the conserved residues are
   involved in binding a metal ion and/or the phosphate group of the substrate. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0626] This family contains Sodium, Potassium, Calcium ion channel This family is 6
   transmembrane helices in which the last two helices flank a loop which determines ion

  <p> 314. Isocitrate and isopropylmalate dehydrogenases signature (isodh) </p>
  <p>[0627] Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) [1,2] is an important enzyme of carbohydrate metabolism
   which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate. IDH is
   either dependent on NAD+ (EC 1.1.1.41) or on NADP+(EC 1.1.1.42). In eukaryotes there are at least
   three isozymes of IDH: two are located in the mitochondrial matrix (one NAD+-dependent, the other
   NADP+-dependent), while the third one (also NADP+-dependent) is cytoplasmic. In Escherichia coli
   the activity of a NADP+-dependent form of the enzyme is controlled by the phosphorylation of a
   serine residue; the phosphorylated form of IDH is completely inactivated. 3-isopropylmalate
   dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.85) (IMDH) [3,4] catalyzes the third step in the biosynthesis of leucine
   in bacteria and fungi, the oxidative decarboxylation of 3-isopropylmalate into
   2-oxo-4-methylvalerate. Tartrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.93) [5] catalyzes the reduction of
   tartrate to oxaloglycolate. These enzymes are evolutionary related [1,3,4,5]. The best conserved
   region of these enzymes is a glycine-rich stretch of residues located in the C-terminal section.
   This region was used as a signature pattern. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 319. Beta-ketoacyl synthases active site </p>
  <p>[0632] Beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) [1] is the enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of
   malonyl-ACP with the growing fatty acid chain. It is found as a component of the following
   enzymatic systems: - Fatty acid synthetase (FAS), which catalyzes the formation of long-chain
   fatty acids from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and NADPH. Bacterial and plant chloroplast FAS are
   composed of eight separate subunits which correspond to different enzymatic activities;
   beta-ketoacyl synthase is one of these polypeptides. Fungal FAS consists of two multifunctional
   proteins, FAS1 and FAS2; the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain is located in the C-terminal section
   of FAS2. Vertebrate FAS consists of a single multifunctional chain; the beta-ketoacyl synthase
   domain is located in the N-terminal section [2]. - The multifunctional 6-methysalicylic acid
   synthase (MSAS) from Penicillium patulum [3]. This is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the
   biosynthesis of a polyketide antibiotic and which has a KAS domain in its N-terminal section. -
   Polyketide antibiotic synthase enzyme systems. Polyketides are secondary metabolites produced by
   microorganisms and plants from simple fatty acids. KAS is one of the components involved in the
   biosynthesis of the Streptomyces polyketide antibiotics granatacin [4], tetracenomycin C [5] and
   erythromycin. - Emericella nidulans multifunctional protein Wa. Wa is involved in the
   biosynthesis of conidial green pigment. Wa is protein of 216 Kd that contains a KAS domain. -
   Rhizobium nodulation protein nodE, which probably acts as a beta-ketoacyl synthase in the
   synthesis of the nodulation Nod factor fatty acyl chain. - Yeast mitochondrial protein CEM1. The
   condensation reaction is a two step process: the acyl component of an activated acyl primer is
   transferred to a cysteine residue of the enzyme and is then condensed with an activated malonyl
   donor with the concomitant release of carbon dioxide. The sequence around the active site

  <p> 320. Kinesin motor domain signature and profile </p>
  <p>[0633] Kinesin [1,2,3] is a microtubule-associated force-producing protein that mayplay a role
   in organelle transport. Kinesin is an oligomeric complex composedof two heavy chains and two
   light chains. The kinesin motor activity isdirected toward the microtubule's plus end.The heavy
   chain is composed of three structural domains: a large globular N-terminal domain which is
   responsible for the motor activity of kinesin (it isknown to hydrolyze ATP, to bind and move on
   microtubules), a central alpha-helical coiled coil domain that mediates the heavy chain
   dimerization; and asmall globular C-terminal domain which interacts with other proteins (such
   asthe kinesin light chains), vesicles and membranous organelles.A number of proteins have been
   recently found that contain a domain similarto that of the kinesin 'motor' domain [1,4,E1]: -
   Drosophila claret segregational protein (ncd). Ncd is required for normal chromosomal segregation
   in meiosis, in females, and in early mitotic divisions of the embryo. The ncd motor activity is
   directed toward the microtubule's minus end. - Drosophila kinesin- like protein (nod). Nod is
   required for the distributive chromosome segregation of nonexchange chromosomes during meiosis. -
   Human CENP-E [4]. CENP-E is a protein that associates with kinetochores during chromosome
   congression, relocates to the spindle midzone at anaphase, and is quantitatively discarded at the
   end of the cell division. CENP-E is probably an important motor molecule in chromosome movement
   and/ or spindle elongation. - Human mitotic kinesin-like protein-1 (MKLP-1), a motor protein
   whose activity is directed toward the microtubule's plus end. - Yeast KAR3 protein, which is
   essential for yeast nuclear fusion during mating. KAR3 may mediate microtubule sliding during
   nuclear fusion and possibly mitosis. - Yeast CIN8 and KIP1 proteins which are required for the
   assembly of the mitotic spindle. Both proteins seem to interact with spindle microtubules to
   produce an outwardly directed force acting upon the poles. - Fission yeast cut7 protein, which is
   essential for spindle body duplication during mitotic division. - Emericella nidulans bimC, which
   plays an important role in nuclear division. - Emericella nidulans klpA. - Caenorhabditis elegans
   unc-104, which may be required for the transport of substances needed for neuronal cell
   differentiation. - Caenorhabditis elegans osm-3. - Xenopus Eg5, which may be involved in mitosis.
   - Arabidopsis thaliana KatA, KatB and katC. - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii FLA10/KHP1 and KLP1. Both
   proteins seem to play a role in the rotation or twisting of the microtubules of the flagella. -
   Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein T09A5.2.The kinesin motor domain is located in the
   N-terminal part of most of theabove proteins, with the exception of KAR3, klpA, and ncd where it
   is locatedin the C-terminal section.The kinesin motor domain contains about 330 amino acids. An
   ATP-binding motifof type A is found near position 80 to 90, the C-terminal half of the domainis
   involved in microtubule-binding. The signature pattern for that domain isderived from a conserved
   decapeptide inside the microtubule-binding part. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 321. Ribosomal protein L15 signature </p>
  <p>[0634] Ribosomal protein L15 is one of the proteins from the large ribosomal subunit. In
   Escherichia coli, L15 is known to bind the 23S rRNA. It belongs to a family of ribosomal proteins
   which, on the basis of sequence similarities [1], groups: - Eubacterial L15. - Plant chloroplast
   L15 (nuclear-encoded). - Archaebacterial L15. - Vertebrate L27a. - Tetrahymena thermophila L29. -
   Fungi L27a (L29, CRP-1, CYH2).L15 is a protein of 144 to 154 amino-acid residues. As a signature
   pattern, a conserved region was selected in the C-terminal section of these proteins. Consensus

  <p> 322. LBP / BPI / CETP family signature </p>
  <p>[0635] The following mammalian lipid-binding serum glycoproteins belong to the same family
   [1,2,3]: - Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). LBP binds to the lipid A moiety of bacterial
   lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a glycolipid present in the outer membrane of all Gram-negative
   bacteria. The LBP/LPS complex seems to interact with the CD14 receptor and may be responsible for
   the secretion of alpha-TNF. - Bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI). Like LBP, BPI
   binds LPS and has a cytotoxic activity on Gram-negative bacteria. - Cholesteryl ester transfer
   protein (CETP). CETP is involved in the transfer of insoluble cholesteryl esters in reverse
   cholesterol transport. - Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). May play a key role in
   extracellular phospholipid transport and modulation of HDL particles. These proteins are
   structurally related and share many regions of sequencesimilarities. As a signature pattern one
   of these regions was selected, which is located in the N-terminal section of these proteins; a
   region which could be involved in the binding to the lipids [2]. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 323. LIM domain signature and profile </p>
  <p>[0636] Recently [1,2] a number of proteins have been found to contain a conserved cysteine-rich
   domain of about 60 amino-acid residues. These proteins are: - Caenorhabditis elegans mec-3; a
   protein required for the differentiation of the set of six touch receptor neurons in this
   nematode. - Caenorhabditis elegans lin-11; a protein required for the asymmetric division of
   vulval blast cells. - Vertebrate insulin gene enhancer binding protein isl-1. Isl-1 binds to one
   of the two cis-acting protein-binding domains of the insulin gene. - Vertebrate homeobox proteins
   lim-1, lim-2 (lim-5) and lim3. - Vertebrate lmx-1, which acts as a transcriptional activator by
   binding to the FLAT element; a beta-cell-specific transcriptional enhancer found in the insulin
   gene. - Mammalian LH-2, a transcriptional regulatory protein involved in the control of cell
   differentiation in developing lymphoid and neural cell types. - Drosophila protein apterous,
   required for the normal development of the wing and halter imaginal discs. - Vertebrate protein
   kinases LIMK-1 and LIMK-2. - Mammalian rhombotins. Rhombotin 1 (RBTN1 or TTG-1) and rhombotin-2
   (RBTN2 or TTG-2) are proteins of about 160 amino acids whose genes are disrupted by chromosomal
   translocations in T-cell leukemia. - Mammalian and avian cysteine-rich protein (CRP), a 192
   amino-acid protein of unknown function. Seems to interact with zyxin. - Mammalian cysteine-rich
   intestinal protein (CRIP), a small protein which seems to have a role in zinc absorption and may
   function as an intracellular zinc transport protein. - Vertebrate paxillin, a cytoskeletal focal
   adhesion protein. - Mouse testin. Mouse testin should not be confused with rat testin which is a
   thiol protease homolog. - Sunflower pollen specific protein SF3. - Chicken zyxin. Zyxin is a
   low-abundance adhesion plaque protein which has been shown to interact with CRP. - Yeast protein
   LRG1 which is involved in sporulation [4]. - Yeast rho-type GTPase activating protein RGA1/DBM1.
   - Caenorhabditis elegans homeobox protein ceh-14. - Caenorhabditis elegans homeobox protein
   unc-97. - Yeast hypothetical protein YKR090w. - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins
   C28H8.6.These proteins generally have two tandem copies of a domain, called LIM (forLin-11 Isl-1
   Mec-3) in their N-terminal section. Zyxin and paxillin areexceptions in that they contains
   respectively three and four LIM domains attheir C-terminal extremity. In apterous, isl-1, LH-2,
   lin-11, lim-1 to lim-3,lmx-1 and ceh-14 and mec-3 there is a homeobox domain some 50 to 95 amino
   acids after theLIM domains.In the LIM domain, there are seven conserved cysteine residues and
   ahistidine. The arrangement followed by these conserved residues is
   C-x(2)-C-x(16,23)-H-x(2)-[CH]-x(2)-C-x(2)-C-x(16,21)-C-x(2,3)-[CHD]. The LIM domainbinds two zinc
   ions [5]. LIM does not bind DNA, rather it seems to act asinterface for protein-protein
   interaction. A pattern was developed that spans the first half of the LIM domain. Consensus

   proteins, whose subcellular location is not yet known, could play a major role in membrane
   biogenesis by conveying phospholipids such as waxes or cutin from their site of biosynthesis to
   membranes unable to form these lipids. Plant LTP's are proteins of about 9 Kd (90 amino acids)
   which contain eight conserved cysteine residues all involved in disulfide bridges, as shown in

  <p>[0639] Lysosome-associated membrane glycoproteins (lamp) [1] are integral membrane proteins,
   specific to lysosomes, and whose exact biological function is not yet clear. Structurally, the
   lamp proteins consist of two internally homologous lysosome-luminal domains separated by a
   proline-rich hinge region; at the C-terminal extremity there is a transmembrane region followed
   by a very short cytoplasmic tail. In each of the duplicated domains, there are two conserved
   disulfide bonds. This structure is schematically represented in the figure below.

  <p> 330. (Lum binding) Riboflavin synthase alpha chain family Lum-binding site signature </p>
  <p>* The following proteins have been shown [1,2] to be structurally and evolutionary related: -
   Riboflavin synthase alpha chain (RS-alpha) (gene ribC in Escherichia coli, ribB in Bacillus
   subtilis and Photobacterium leiognathi, RIB5 in yeast). This enzyme synthesizes riboflavin from
   two moles of 6,7- dimethyl-8-(1'-D-ribityl)lumazine (Lum), a pteridine-derivative. -
   Photobacterium phosphoreum lumazine protein (LumP) (gene luxL). LumP is a protein that modulates
   the color of the bioluminescence emission of bacterial luciferase. In the presence of LumP, light
   emission is shifted to higher energy values (shorter wavelength). LumP binds non-covalently to
   6,7-dimethyl-8-(1'-D-ribityl) lumazine. - Vibrio fischeri yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (gene
   luxY). Like LumP, YFP modulates light emission but towards a longer wavelength. YFP binds
   non-covalently to FMN. These proteins seem to have evolved from the duplication of a domain of
   about 100 residues. In its C-terminal section, this domain contains a conserved motif
   [KR]-V-N-[LI]-E which has been proposed to be the binding site for Lum.RS-alpha which binds two
   molecules of Lum has two perfect copies of this motif, while LumP which binds one molecule of
   Lum, has a Glu instead of Lys/Arg in the first position of the second copy of the motif.

  <p> 331. Lysyl oxidase putative copper-binding region signature </p>
  <p>[0644] Lysyl oxidase (LOX) [1] is an extracellular copper-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the
   oxidative deamination of peptidyl lysine residues in precursors of various collagens and
   elastins. The deaminated lysines are then able to form aldehyde cross-links.LOX binds a single
   copper atom which seems to reside within an octahedral coordination complex which includes at
   least three histidine ligands. Fourhistidine residues are clustered in a central region of the
   enzyme. This region is thought to be involved in cooper-binding and is called the 'copper-talon'
   [1]. This region was used as a signature pattern. Consensus pattern: W-E-W-H-S-C-H-Q-H-Y-H [ 1]

  <p> 333. L-lactate dehydrogenase active site (ldh1) </p>
  <p>[0646] L-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) (LDH) [1] catalyzes the reversible NAD-dependent
   interconversion of pyruvate to L-lactate. In vertebrate muscles and in lactic acid bacteria it
   represents the final step in anaerobic glycolysis. This tetrameric enzyme is present in
   prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Invertebrates there are three isozymes of LDH: the M form
   (LDH-A), found predominantly in muscle tissues; the H form (LDH-B), found in heart muscle and the
   X form (LDH-C), found only in the spermatozoa of mammals and birds. In birds and crocodilian eye
   lenses, LDH-B serves as a structural protein and is known as epsilon-crystallin
   [2].L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.-) (L-hicDH) [3] catalyzes the reversible and
   stereospecific interconversion between 2-ketocarboxylic acids and L-2-hydroxy-carboxylic acids.
   L-hicDH is evolutionary related to LDH's. As a signature for LDH's a region was selected that
   includes a conserved histidine which is essential to the catalytic mechanism. Consensus pattern:

  <p> Malate dehydrogenase active site signature (ldh2) </p>
  <p>[0647] Malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) (MDH) [1,2] catalyzes the interconversion of malate
   to oxaloacetate utilizing the NAD/NADH cofactor system. The enzyme participates in the citric
   acid cycle and exists in all aerobic organisms. While prokaryotic organisms contains a single
   form of MDH, in eukaryotic cells there are two isozymes: one which is located in the
   mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytoplasm. Fungi and plants also harbor a glyoxysomal
   form which functions in the glyoxylate pathway. In plants chloroplast there is an additional
   NADP-dependent form of MDH (EC 1.1.1.82) which is essential for both the universal C3
   photosynthesis (Calvin) cycle and the more specializedC4 cycle. As a signature pattern for this
   enzyme a region was chosen that includes two residues involved in the catalytic mechanism [3]: an
   aspartic acid which is involved in a proton relay mechanism, and an arginine which binds the

  <p> 334. Legume lectins signatures </p>
  <p> [0648] Leguminous plants synthesize sugar-binding proteins which are called legume lectins
   [1,2]. These lectins are generally found in the seeds. The exact function of legume lectins is
   not known but they may be involved in the attachment of nitrogen-fixing bacteria to legumes and
   in the protection against pathogens. Legume lectins bind calcium and manganese (or other
   transition metals). Legume lectins are synthesized as precursor proteins of about 230 to 260
   amino acid residues. Some legume lectins are proteolytically processed to produce two chains:
   beta (which corresponds to the N-terminal) and alpha (C-terminal).The lectin concanavalin A
   (conA) from jack bean is exceptional in that the two chains are transposed and ligated (by
   formation of a new peptide bond). The N-terminus of mature conA thus corresponds to that of the
   alpha chain and the C-terminus to the beta chain. Two signature patterns specific to legume
   lectins have been developed: the first is located in the C-terminal section of the beta chain and
   contains a conserved aspartic acid residue important for the binding of calcium and manganese;
   the second one is located in the N-terminal of the alpha chain. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 337. Lipocalin signature (lip1) </p>
  <p>[0651] Proteins which transport small hydrophobic molecules such as steroids, bilins,
   retinoids, and lipids share limited regions of sequence homology and a common tertiary structure
   architecture [1 to 5]. This is an eight stranded antiparallel beta-barrel with a repeated + 1
   topology enclosing a internal ligand binding site [1,3]. The name 'lipocalin' has been proposed
   [5] for this protein family. Proteins known to belong to this family are listed below (references
   are only provided for recently determined sequences). - Alpha-1-microglobulin (protein HC), which
   seems to bind porphyrin. - Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid), which can bind a remarkable
   array of natural and synthetic compounds [6]. - Aphrodisin which, in hamsters, functions as an
   aphrodisiac pheromone. - Apolipoprotein D, which probably binds heme-related compounds. -
   Beta-lactoglobulin, a milk protein whose physiological function appears to bind retinol. -
   Complement component C8 gamma chain, which seems to bind retinol [7]. - Crustacyanin [8], a
   protein from lobster carapace, which binds astaxanthin, a carotenoid. - Epididymal-retinoic acid
   binding protein (E-RABP) [9] involved in sperm maturation. - Insectacyanin, a moth bilin-binding
   protein, and a related butterfly bilin- binding protein (BBP). - Late Lactation protein (LALP), a
   milk protein from tammar wallaby [10]. - Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) (p25)
   (SV-40 induced 24p3 protein) [11]. - Odorant-binding protein (OBP), which binds odorants. -
   Plasma retinol-binding proteins (PRBP). - Human pregnancy-associated endometrial alpha-2
   globulin. - Probasin (PB), a rat prostatic protein. - Prostaglandin D synthase (EC 5.3.99.2)
   (GSH-independent PGD synthetase), a lipocalin with enzymatic activity [12]. - Purpurin, a retinal
   protein which binds retinol and heparin. - Quiescence specific protein p20K from chicken (embryo
   CH21 protein). - Rodent urinary proteins (alpha-2-microglobulin), which may bind pheromones. -
   VNSP 1 and 2, putative pheromone transport proteins from mouse vomeronasal organ [13]. - Von
   Ebner's gland protein (VEGP) [14] (also called tear lipocalin), a mammalian protein which may be
   involved in taste recognition. - A frog olfactory protein, which may transport odorants. - A
   protein found in the cerebrospinal fluid of the toad Bufo Marinus with a supposed function
   similar to transthyretin in transport across the blood brain barrier [15]. - Lizard's epididymal
   secretory protein IV (LESP IV), which could transport small hydrophobic molecules into the
   epididymal fluid during sperm maturation [16]. - Prokaryotic outer-membrane protein blc [17].The
   sequences of most members of the family, the core or kernal lipocalins, are characterized by
   three short conserved stretches of residues [3,18].Others, the outlier lipocalin group, share
   only one or two of these [3,18]. A signature pattern was built around the first, common to all
   outlier and kemallipocalins, which occurs near the start of the first beta-strand. Consensus
   pattern: [DENG]-x-[DENQGSTARK]-x(0,2)-[DENQARK]-[LIVFY]-{CP}-G-{C}-W-[FYWLRH]-x-[LIVMTA]- Note:
   it is suggested, on the basis of similarities of structure, function, and sequence, that this
   family forms an overall superfamily, called the calycins, with the avidin/streptavidin

  <p> Cytosolic fatty-acid binding proteins signature (lip2) </p>
  <p>[0652] A number of low molecular weight proteins which bind fatty acids and other organic
   anions are present in the cytosol [1,2]. Most of them are structurally related and have probably
   diverged from a common ancestor. This structure is a ten stranded antiparallel beta-barrel,
   albeit with a wide discontinuity between the fourth and fifth strands, with a repeated + 1
   topology enclosing an internal ligand binding site [2,7]. Proteins known to belong to this family
   include: - Six, tissue-specific, types of fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) found in liver,
   intestine, heart, epidermal, adipocyte, brain/retina. Heart FABP is also known as mammary-derived
   growth inhibitor (MDGI), a protein that reversibly inhibits proliferation of mammary carcinoma
   cells. Epidermal FABP is also known as psoriasis-associated FABP [3]. - Insect muscle fatty
   acid-binding proteins. - Testis lipid binding protein (TLBP). - Cellular retinol-binding proteins
   I and II (CRBP). - Cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP). - Gastrotropin, an ileal
   protein which stimulates gastric acid and pepsinogen secretion. It seems that gastrotropin binds
   to bile salts and bilirubins. - Fatty acid binding proteins MFB1 and MFB2 from the midgut of the
   insect Manduca sexta [4].In addition to the above cytosolic proteins, this family also includes:
   - Myelin P2 protein, which may be a lipid transport protein in Schwann cells. P2 is associated
   with the lipid bilayer of myelin.- Schistosoma mansoni protein Sm14 [5] which seems to be
   involved in the transport of fatty acids. - Ascaris suum p18 a secreted protein that may play a
   role in sequestering potentially toxic fatty acids and their peroxidation products or that may be
   involved in the maintenance of the impermeable lipid layer of the eggshell. - Hypothetical fatty
   acid-binding proteins F40F4.2, F40F4.3, F40F4.4 and ZK742.5 from Caenorhabditis elegans. As a
   signature pattern for these proteins a segment from the N-terminal extremity was use. Consensus

  <p> 338. Lipoxygenases iron-binding region signatures </p>
  <p>[0653] Lipoxygenases (EC 1.13.11.-) are a class of iron-containing dioxygenases which catalyzes
   the hydroperoxidation of lipids, containing a cis,cis-1,4-pentadiene structure. They are common
   in plants where they may be involved in a number of diverse aspects of plant physiology including
   growth and development, pest resistance, and senescence or responses to wounding [1]. In mammals
   a number of lipoxygenases isozymes are involved in the metabolism of prostaglandins and
   leukotrienes [2]. Sequence data is available for the following lipoxygenases: - Plant
   lipoxygenases (EC 1.13.11.12). Plants express a variety of cytosolic isozymes as well as what
   seems [3] to be a chloroplast isozyme. - Mammalian arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.34). -
   Mammalian arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.31). - Mammalian erythroid cell-specific
   15-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.33).The iron atom in lipoxygenases is bound by four ligands, three of
   which are histidine residues [4]. Six histidines are conserved in all lipoxygenase sequences,
   five of them are found clustered in a stretch of 40 amino acids. This region contains two of the
   three zinc-ligands; the other histidines have been shown [5] to be important for the activity of
   lipoxygenases. As signatures for this family of enzymes two patterns in the region of the
   histidine cluster were selected. The first pattern contains the first three conserved histidines
   and the second pattern includes the fourth and the fifth. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 339. Fumarate lyases signature (lyase_1) </p>
  <p>[0654] A number of enzymes, belonging to the lyase class, for which fumarate is a substrate
   have been shown [1,2] to share a short conserved sequence around a methionine which is probably
   involved in the catalytic activity of this type of enzymes. These enzymes are: - Fumarase (EC
   4.2.1.2) (fumarate hydratase), which catalyzes the reversible hydration of fumarate to L-malate.
   There seem to be 2 classes of fumarases: class I are thermolabile dimeric enzymes (as for
   example: Escherichia coli fumC); class II enzymes are thermostable and tetrameric and are found
   in prokaryotes (as for example: Escherichia coli fumA and fumB) as well as in eukaryotes. The
   sequence of the two classes of fumarases are not closely related. - Aspartate ammonia-lyase (EC
   4.3.1.1) (aspartase), which catalyzes the reversible conversion of aspartate to fumarate and
   ammonia. This reaction is analogous to that catalyzed by fumarase, except that ammonia rather
   than water is involved in the trans-elimination reaction. - Arginosuccinase (EC 4.3.2.1)
   (argininosuccinate lyase), which catalyzes the formation of arginine and fumarate from
   argininosuccinate, the last step in the biosynthesis of arginine. - Adenylosuccinase (EC 4.3.2.2)
   (adenylosuccinate lyase) [3], which catalyzes the eight step in the de novo biosynthesis of
   purines, the formation of 5'-phosphoribosyl-5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide and fumarate from
   1-(5- phosphoribosyl)-4-(N-succino-carboxamide). That enzyme can also catalyzes the formation of
   fumarate and AMP from adenylosuccinate. - Pseudomonas putida 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate
   cycloisomerase (EC 5.5.1.2) (3-carboxymuconate lactonizing enzyme) (gene pcaB) [4], an enzyme
   involved in aromatic acids catabolism Consensus pattern: G-S-x(2)-M-x(2)-K-x-N- [ 1] <ref type="npl">Woods S.A.,

  <p> 340. MCM family signature and profile </p>
  <p>[0655] Proteins shown to be required for the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication share a
   highly conserved domain of about 210 amino-acid residues [1,2,3]. The latter shows some
   similarities [4] with that of various other families of DNA-dependent ATPases. Eukaryotes seem to
   possess a family of six proteins that contain this domain. They were first identified in yeast
   where most of them have a direct role in the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication by
   interacting directly with autonomously replicating sequences (ARS). They were thus called
   'minichromosome maintenance proteins' with gene symbols prefixed by MCM. These six proteins are:
   - MCM2, also known as cdc19 (in S.pombe) [E1]. - MCM3, also known as DNA polymerase alpha
   holoenzyme-associated protein P1, RLF beta subunit or ROA. - MCM4, also known as CDC54, cdc21 (in
   S.pombe) or dpa (in Drosophila). - MCM5, also known as CDC46 or nda4 (in S.pombe). - MCM6, also
   known as mis5 (in S.pombe). - MCM7, also known as CDC47 or Prolifera (in A.thaliana).This family
   is also present in archebacteria. In Methanococcus jannaschiithere are four members: MJ0363,
   MJ0961, MJ1489 and MJECL13.The presence of a putative ATP-binding domain implies that these
   proteins maybe involved in an ATP-consuming step in the initiation of DNA replication in
   eukaryotes. As a signature pattern, a perfectly conserved region was selected that represents a
   special version of the B motif found in ATP-binding proteins. Consensus pattern:

   important role in host inflammatory responses. It play a pivotal role in the host response to
   endotoxic shock and appears to serve as a pituitary &quot;stress&quot; hormone that regulates
   systemic inflammatory responses. MIF is a secreted protein of 115 residues which is not processed
   from a larger precursor. D-dopachrome tautomerase [2] is a mammalian cytoplasmic enzyme involved
   in melanin biosynthesis and that tautomerizes D-dopachrome with concomitant decarboxylation to
   give 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI). It is a protein of 117 residues highly related to MIF. It must be
   noted that MIF binds glutathione and has been said to be related to glutathione S-transferases.
   This assertion has been later disproved [3].As a signature pattern for these proteins, a
   conserved region was selected located in the central section. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 342. MIP family signature </p>
  <p>[0657] Recently the sequence of a number of different proteins, that all seem to be
   transmembrane channel proteins, has been found to be highly related [1 to 4].These proteins are
   listed below. - Mammalian major intrinsic protein (MIP). MIP is the major component of lens fiber
   gap junctions. Gap junctions mediate direct exchange of ions and small molecule from one cell to
   another. - Mammalian aquaporins [5]. These proteins form water-specific channels that provide the
   plasma membranes of red cells and kidney proximal and collecting tubules with high permeability
   to water, thereby permitting water to move in the direction of an osmotic gradient. - Soybean
   nodulin-26, a major component of the peribacteroid membrane induced during nodulation in legume
   roots after Rhizobium infection. - Plants tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIP). There are various
   isoforms of TIP: alpha (seed), gamma, Rt (root), and Wsi (water-stress induced). These proteins
   may allow the diffusion of water, amino acids and/or peptides from the tonoplast interior to the
   cytoplasm. - Bacterial glycerol facilitator protein (gene glpF), which facilitates the movement
   of glycerol across the cytoplasmic membrane. - Salmonella typhimurium propanediol diffusion
   facilitator (gene pduF). - Yeast FPS1, a glycerol uptake/efflux facilitator protein. - Drosophila
   neurogenic protein 'big brain' (bib). This protein may mediate intercellular communication; it
   may functions by allowing the transport of certain molecules(s) and thereby sending a signal for
   an exodermal cell to become an epidermoblast instead of a neuroblast. - Yeast hypothetical
   protein YFL054c. - A hypothetical protein from the pepX region of lactococcus lactis. The MIP
   family proteins seem to contain six transmembrane segments. Computer analysis shows that these
   protein probably arose by a tandem, intragenic duplication event from an ancestral protein that
   contained three transmembrane segments. As a signature pattern a well conserved region was
   selected which is located in a probable cytoplasmic loop between the second and third
   transmembrane regions. Consensus pattern: [HNQA]-x-N-P-[STA]-[LIVMF]-[ST]-[LIVMF]-[GSTAFY]- [ 1]

  <p>[0658] Mandelate racemase (EC 5.1.2.2) (MR) and muconate lactonizing enzyme(EC 5.5.1.1) (MLE)
   are two bacterial enzymes involved in aromatic acid catabolism. They catalyze mechanistically
   distinct reactions yet they are related at the level of their primary, quaternary (homooctamer)
   and tertiary structures [1,2].A number of other proteins also seem to be evolutionary related to
   these two enzymes. These are: - The various plasmid-encoded chloromuconate cycloisomerases (EC
   5.5.1.7). - Escherichia coli protein rspA [3], rspA seems to be involved in the degradation of
   homoserine lactone (HSL) or of one of its metabolite. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein
   ycjG. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yidU. - A hypothetical protein from Streptomyces
   ambofaciens [4]. Two signature patterns have been developed for these enzymes; both contain
   conserved acidic residues. The second pattern contains an aspartate and a glutamate which are
   ligands for either a magnesium ion (in MR) or a manganese ion (inMLE). Consensus pattern:

  <p> 355. Malic enzymes signature. </p>
  <p>[0670] Malic enzymes, or malate oxidoreductases, catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of
   malate into pyruvate important for a wide range of metabolic pathways. There are three related
   forms of malic enzyme [1,2,3]: - NAD-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.38), which uses
   preferentially NAD and has the ability to decarboxylate oxaloacetate (OAA). It is found in
   bacteria and insects. - NAD-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.39), which uses preferentially NAD
   and is unable to decarboxylate OAA. It is found in the mitochondrial matrix of plants and is a
   heterodimer of highly related subunits. - NADP-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40), which has a
   preference for NADP and has the ability to decarboxylate OAA. This form has been found in fungi,
   animals and plants. In mammals, there are two isozymes: one, mitochondrial and the other,
   cytosolic. Plants also have two isozymes: chloroplastic and cytosolic. There are two other
   proteins which are closely structurally related to malicenzymes: - Escherichia coli protein sfcA,
   whose function is not yet known but which could be an NAD or NADP-dependent malic enzyme. - Yeast
   hypothetical protein YKL029c, a probable malic enzyme. There are three well conserved regions in
   the enzyme sequences. Two of them seem to be involved in binding NAD or NADP. The significance of
   the third one, located in the central part of the enzymes, is not yet known. This region has been
   developed as a signature pattern for these enzymes. Consensus pattern:

  <p> Matrixins cysteine switch (aka peptidase_M10) </p>
  <p>[0671] Mammalian extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (EC 3.4.24.-), also known as matrixins
   [1] (see &lt;PDOC00129&gt;), are zinc-dependent enzymes. They are secreted by cells in an
   inactive form (zymogen) that differs from the mature enzyme by the presence of an N-terminal
   propeptide. A highly conserved octapeptide is found two residues downstream of the C-terminal end
   of the propeptide. This region has been shown to be involved in autoinhibition of matrixins
   [2,3]; a cysteine within the octapeptide chelates the active site zinc ion, thus inhibiting the
   enzyme. This region has been called the 'cysteine switch' or 'autoinhibitor region'. </p>

  <p> 357. Vertebrate metallothioneins signature (metalthio) </p>
  <p>[0673] Metallothioneins (MT) [1,2,3] are small proteins which bind heavy metals such as zinc,
   copper, cadmium, nickel, etc., through clusters of thiolate bonds. MT's occur throughout the
   animal kingdom and are also found in higher plants, fungi and some prokaryotes. On the basis of
   structural relationships MT's have been subdivided into three classes. Class I includes mammalian
   MT's as well as MT's from crustacean and molluscs, but with clearly related primary structure.
   Class II groups together MT's from various species such as sea urchins, fungi, insects and
   cyanobacteria which display none or only very distant correspondence to class I MT's. Class III
   MT's are atypical polypeptides containing gamma-glutamylcysteinyl units. Vertebrate class I MT's
   are proteins of 60 to 68 amino acid residues, 20 of these residues are cysteines that bind to 7
   bivalent metal ions. As a signature pattern a region that spans 19 residues and which contains
   seven of the metal-binding cysteines was chosen, this region is located in the N-terminal section
   of class-I MT's. Consensus pattern: C-x-C-[GSTAP]-x(2)-C-x-C-x(2)-C-x-C-x(2)-C-x-K- [ 1] <ref type="npl">Hamer

  <p> 358. Mitochondrial energy transfer proteins signature (mito_ carr) </p>
  <p>[0674] Different types of substrate carrier proteins involved in energy transfer are found in
   the inner mitochondrial membrane [1 to 5]. These are: - The ADP,ATP carrier protein (AAC)
   (ADP/ATP translocase) which exports ATP into the cytosol and imports ADP into the mitochondrial
   matrix. The sequence of AAC has been obtained from various mammalian, plant and fungal species. -
   The 2-oxoglutarate/malate carrier protein (OGCP), which exports 2-oxoglutarate into the cytosol
   and imports malate or other dicarboxylic acids into the mitochondrial matrix. This protein plays
   an important role in several metabolic processes such as the malate/aspartate and the
   oxoglutarate/isocitrate shuttles. - The phosphate carrier protein, which transports phosphate
   groups from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix. - The brown fat uncoupling protein (UCP)
   which dissipates oxidative energy into heat by transporting protons from the cytosol into the
   mitochondrial matrix. - The tricarboxylate transport protein (or citrate transport protein) which
   is involved in citrate-H+/malate exchange. It is important for the bioenergetics of hepatic cells
   as it provides a carbon source for fatty acid and sterol biosyntheses, and NAD for the glycolytic
   pathway. - The Grave's disease carrier protein (GDC), a protein of unknown function recognized by
   IgG in patients with active Grave's disease. - Yeast mitochondrial proteins MRS3 and MRS4. The
   exact function of these proteins is not known. They suppress a mitochondrial splice defect in the
   first intron of the COB gene and may act as carriers, exerting their suppressor activity by
   modulating solute concentrations in the mitochondrion. - Yeast mitochondrial FAD carrier protein
   (gene FLX1).- Yeast protein ACR1 [6], which seems essential for acetyl-CoA synthetase activity. -
   Yeast protein PET8. - Yeast protein PMT. - Yeast protein RIM2. - Yeast protein YHM1/SHM1. - Yeast
   protein YMC1. - Yeast protein YMC2. - Yeast hypothetical proteins YBR291c, YEL006w, YER053c,
   YFR045w, YHR002w, and YIL006w. - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein K.11H3.3.Two other
   proteins have been found to belong to this family, yet are not localized in the mitochondrial
   inner membrane: - Maize amyloplast Brittle-1 protein. This protein, found in the endosperm of
   kernels, could play a role in amyloplast membrane transport. - Candida boidinii peroxisomal
   membrane protein PMP47 [7]. PMP47 is an integral membrane protein of the peroxisome and it may
   play a role as a transporter. These proteins all seem to be evolutionary related. Structurally,
   they consistof three tandem repeats of a domain of approximately one hundred residues. Each of
   these domains contains two transmembrane regions. As a signature pattern, one of the most
   conserved regions in the repeated domain was selected, located just after the first transmembrane
   region. Consensus pattern: P-x-[DE]-x-[LIVAT]-[RK]-x-[LRH]-[LIVMFY]-[QGAIVM]- [ 1] <ref type="npl">Klingenberg M.

  <p> 359. Prokaryotic molybdopterin oxidoreductases signatures (molybdopterin) </p>
  <p>[0675] A number of different prokaryotic oxidoreductases that require and bind amolybdopterin
   cofactor have been shown [1,2,3] to share a number of regions of sequence similarity. These
   enzymes are: - Escherichia coli respiratory nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.99.4). This enzyme complex
   allows the bacteria to use nitrate as an electron acceptor during anaerobic growth. The enzyme is
   composed of three different chains: alpha, beta and gamma. The alpha chain (gene narG) is the
   molybdopterin-binding subunit. Escherichia coli encodes for a second, closely related, nitrate
   reductase complex which also contains a molybdopterin-binding alpha chain (gene narZ). -
   Escherichia coli anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DMSO reductase). DMSO reductase is the
   terminal reductase during anaerobic growth on various sulfoxide and N-oxide compounds. DMSO
   reductase is composed of three chains: A, B and C. The A chain (gene dmsA) binds molybdopterin. -
   Escherichia coli biotin sulfoxide reductases (genes bisC and bisZ). This enzyme reduces a
   spontaneous oxidation product of biotin, BDS, back to biotin. It may serve as a scavenger,
   allowing the cell to use biotin sulfoxide as a biotin source. - Methanobacterium formicicum
   formate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2). The alpha chain (gene fdhA) of this dimeric enzyme binds a
   molybdopterin cofactor. - Escherichia coli formate dehydrogenases -H (gene fdhF), -N (gene fdnG)
   and -O (gene fdoG). These enzymes are responsible for the oxidation of formate to carbon dioxide.
   In addition to molybdopterin, the alpha (catalytic) subunit also contains an active site,
   selenocysteine. - Wolinella succinogenes polysulfide reductase chain. This enzyme is a component
   of the phosphorylative electron transport system with polysulfide as the terminal acceptor. It is
   composed of three chains: A, B and C. The A chain (gene psrA) binds molybdopterin. - Salmonella
   typhimurium thiosulfate reductase (gene phsA). - Escherichia coli trimethylamine-N-oxide
   reductase (EC 1.6.6.9) (gene torA) [4]. - Nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.99.4) from Klebsiella
   pneumoniae (gene nasA), Alcaligenes eutrophus, Escherichia coli, Rhodobacter sphaeroides,
   Thiosphaera pantotropha (gene napA), and Synechococcus PCC 7942 (gene narB).These proteins range
   from 715 amino acids (fdhF) to 1246 amino acids (narZ) insize. Three signature patterns for these
   enzymes were derived. The first is based on a conserved region in the N-terminal section and
   contains two cysteine residues perhaps involved in binding the molybdopterin cofactor. It should
   be noted that this region is not present in bisC. The second pattern is derived from a conserved
   region located in the central part of these enzymes. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 360. Bacterial mutT domain signature </p>
  <p>[0676] The bacterial mutT protein is involved in the GO system [1] responsible for removing an
   oxidatively damaged form of guanine (8-hydroxyguanine or7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine) from DNA and
   the nucleotide pool. 8-oxo-dGTP is inserted opposite to dA and dC residues of template DNA with
   almost equal efficiency thus leading to A.T to G.C transversions. MutT specifically degrades
   8-oxo-dGTP to the monophosphate with the concomitant release of pyrophosphate. MutT is a small
   protein of about 12 to 15 Kd. It has been shown [2,3] that a region of about 40 amino acid
   residues, which is found in the N-terminal part of mutT, can also be found in a variety of other
   prokaryotic, viral, and eukaryotic proteins. These proteins are: Streptomyces pneumoniae mutX. A
   mutT homolog from plasmid pSAM2 of Streptomyces ambofaciens. Bartonella bacilliformis invasion
   protein A (gene invA). Escherichia coli dATP pyrophosphohydrolase. Protein D250 from African
   swine fever viruses. Proteins D9 and D10 from a variety of poxviruses. Mammalian
   7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine triphosphatase (EC 3.1.6.-) [4]. Mammalian diadenosine
   5',5&quot;'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate asymmetrical hydrolase (Ap4Aase) (EC 3.6.1.17) [5], which
   cleaves A-5'-PPPP-5'A to yield AMP and ATP. A protein encoded on the antisense RNA of the basic
   fibroblast growth factor gene in higher vertebrates. Yeast protein YSA1. Escherichia coli
   hypothetical protein yfaO. Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ygdU and HI0901, the
   corresponding Haemophilus influenzae protein. Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjaD and

  <p> 361. Myb DNA-binding domain repeat signatures </p>
  <p>[0678] The retroviral oncogene v-myb , and its cellular counterpart c-myb, encodenuclear
   DNA-binding proteins that specifically recognize the sequence YAAC(G/T)G [1]. The myb family also
   includes the following proteins: - Drosophila D-myb [2]. - Vertebrate myb-like proteins A-myb and
   B-myb [3]. - Maize C1 protein, a trans-acting factor which controls the expression of genes
   involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. - Maize P protein [4], a trans-acting factor which
   regulates the biosynthetic pathway of a flavonoid-derived pigment in certain floral tissues. -
   Arabidopsis thaliana protein GL1 [5], required for the initiation of differentiation of leaf hair
   cells (trichomes). - A number of myb/c1-related proteins in maize and barley, whose roles are not
   yet known [4]. - Yeast BAS1 [7], a transcriptional activator for the HIS4 gene. - Yeast REB1 [8],
   which recognizes sites within both the enhancer and the promoter of rRNA transcription, as well
   as upstream of many genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. - Fission yeast cdc5, a possible
   transcription factor whose activity is required for cell cycle progression and growth during G2.
   - Fission yeast myb1, which regulates telomere length and function. - Yeast hypothetical protein
   YMR213w.One of the most conserved regions in all of these proteins is a domain of 160amino acids.
   It consists of three tandem repeats of 51 to 53 amino acids. In myb, this repeat region has been
   shown [9] to be involved in DNA-binding. The major part of the first repeat is missing in
   retroviral v-myb sequences and in plant myb-related proteins. Yeast REB 1 differs from the other
   proteins in this family in having a single myb-like domain. As shown in the following schematic
   representation, two signature patterns for myb-like domains were developed; the first is located
   in the N-terminal section, the second spans the C-terminal extremity of the domain.

  <p> 365. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases active site </p>
  <p>[0682] Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (EC 2.7.4.6) (NDK) [1] are enzymes required for the
   synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) other than ATP. They provide NTPs for nucleic acid
   synthesis, CTP for lipid synthesis, UTP for polysaccharide synthesis and GTP for protein
   elongation, signal transduction and microtubule polymerization. In eukaryotes, there seems to be
   a small family of NDK isozymes each of which acts in a different subcellular compartment and/or
   has a distinct biological function. Eukaryotic NDK isozymes are hexamers of two highly related
   chains (Aand B) [2]. By random association (A6, A5B...AB5, B6), these two kinds of chain form
   isoenzymes differing in their isoelectric point. NDK are proteins of 17 Kd that act via a
   ping-pong mechanism in which a histidine residue is phosphorylated, by transfer of the terminal
   phosphate group from ATP. In the presence of magnesium, the phosphoenzyme can transfer its
   phosphate group to any NDP, to produce an NTP.NDK isozymes have been sequenced from prokaryotic
   and eukaryotic sources. It has also been shown [3] that the Drosophila awd (abnormal wing discs)
   protein, is a microtubule-associated NDK. Mammalian NDK is also known as metastasis inhibition
   factor nm23.The sequence of NDK has been highly conserved through evolution. There is a single
   histidine residue conserved in all known NDK isozymes, which is involved in the catalytic
   mechanism [2]. Our signature pattern contains this residue. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 366. Nitrite and sulfite reductases iron-sulfur/siroheme-binding site (NIR_SIR) </p>
  <p>[0683] Nitrite reductases (NiR) [1] catalyze the reduction of nitrite into ammonium, the second
   step in the assimilation of nitrate. There are two types of NiR: the higher plant chloroplastic
   form of NiR (EC 1.7.7.1) is a monomeric protein that uses reduced ferredoxin as the electron
   donor; while fungal and bacterial NiR (EC 1.6.6.4) are homodimeric proteins that uses NAD(P)H as
   the electron donor. Both forms of NiR contain a siroheme-Fe and iron-sulfur centers. Sulfite
   reductase (NADPH) (EC 1.8.1.2) (SIR) [2] is the bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of
   sulfite to sulfide. SIR is an oligomeric enzyme with a subunit composition of alpha(8)-beta(4),
   the alpha component is a flavoprotein (SIR-FP), while the beta component is a siroheme,
   iron-sulfurprotein (SIR-HP).Sulfite reductase (ferredoxin) (EC 1.8.7.1) [3] is a cyanobacterial
   and plant monomeric enzyme that also catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide. Anaerobic
   sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.-) (ASR) [4], a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the NADH-dependent
   reduction of sulfite to sulfide. ASR is an oligomeric enzyme composed of three different
   subunits. The C component (geneasrC) seems to be a siroheme, iron-sulfur protein. These enzymes
   share a region of sequence similarity in their C-terminal half; this region which spans about 80
   amino acids includes four conserved cysteine residues. Two of the Cys are grouped together at the
   beginning of the domain, and the two others are grouped in the middle of the domain. The
   cysteines are involved in the binding of the iron-sulfur center; the last one also binds the
   siroheme group [2]. A signature pattern from the region around the second cluster of cysteines
   was derived. Consensus pattern: [STV]-G-C-x(3)-C-x(6)-[DE]-[LIVMF]-[GAT]-[LIVMF] [The two C's are

  <p>[0685] ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase) [1,2](EC
   2.7.7.27) catalyzes a very important step in the biosynthesis of alpha 1,4-glucans (glycogen or
   starch) in bacteria and plants: synthesis of the activated glucosyl donor, ADP-glucose, from
   glucose-1-phosphate and ATP.ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is a tetrameric allosterically
   regulated enzyme. It is a homotetramer in bacteria while in plant chloroplasts and amyloplasts,
   it is a heterotetramer of two different, yet evolutionary related, subunits. There are a number
   of conserved regions in the sequence of bacterial and plant ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase
   subunits. Three of these regions were selected as signature patterns. The first two are
   N-terminal and have been proposed to be part of the allosteric and/or substrate-binding sites in
   the Escherichia coli enzyme (gene glgC). The third pattern corresponds to a conserved region in
   the central part of the enzymes. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0686] Na/H antiporters are key transporters in maintaining the pH of actively metabolizing

   transmembrane regions (M) at the amino-terminus and a large cytoplasmic region at the carboxyl
   terminus. The transmembrane regions M3-M12 share identity with other members of the family. The
   M6 and M7 regions are highly conserved. Thus, this is thought to be the region that is involved
   in the transport of sodium and hydrogen ions. The cytoplasmic region has little similarity

  <p>[0687] Integral membrane proteins that mediate the intake of a wide variety of molecules with
   the concomitant uptake of sodium ions (sodium symporters) canbe grouped, on the basis of sequence
   and functional similarities into a number of distinct families. One of these families currently
   consists of the following proteins: - Mammalian sodium/sulfate cotransporter [1]. - Mammalian
   renal sodium/dicarboxylate cotransporter [2], which transports succinate and citrate. - Mammalian
   intestinal sodium/dicarboxylate cotransporter. - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii putative sulfur

  <p> 372. Nitrilases / cyanide hydratase signatures </p>
  <p>[0690] Nitrilases (EC 3.5.5.1) are enzymes that convert nitriles into their corresponding acids
   and ammonia. They are widespread in microbes as well as in plants where they convert
   indole-3-acetonitrile to the hormone indole-3-acetic acid. A conserved cysteine has been shown
   [1,2] to be essential for enzyme activity; it seems to be involved in a nucleophilic attack on
   the nitrile carbon atom. Cyanide hydratase (EC 4.2.1.66) converts HCN to formamide. In
   phytopathogenic fungi, it is used to avoid the toxic effect of cyanide released by wounded plants
   [3]. The sequence of cyanide hydrolase is evolutionary related to that of nitrilases. Yeast
   hypothetical proteins YIL164c and YIL165c also belong to this family. As signature patterns for
   these enzymes, two conserved regions were selected. The first is located in the N-terminal
   section while the second, which contains the active site cysteine, is located in the central
   section. Consensus pattern: G-x(2)-[LIVMFY](2)-x-[IF]-x-E-x(2)-[LIVM]-x-G-Y-P- Consensus pattern:

  <p> 374. (Neur Chan) Neurotransmitter-gated ion-channels signature </p>
  <p>[0693] Neurotransmitter-gated ion-channels [1,2,3,4] provide the molecular basis for rapid
   signal transmission at chemical synapses. They are post-synapticoligomeric transmembrane
   complexes that transiently form a ionic channel upon the binding of a specific neurotransmitter.
   Presently, the sequence of subunits from five types of neurotransmitter-gated receptors are
   known: - The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR), an excitatory cation channel. In the motor
   endplates of vertebrates, it is composed of four different subunits (alpha, beta, gamma and delta
   or epsilon) with a molar stoichiometry of 2:1:1:1. In neurones, the AchR receptor is composed of
   two different types of subunits: alpha and non-alpha (also called beta). Nicotinic AchRs are also
   found in invertebrates. - The glycine receptor, an inhibitory chloride ion channel. The glycine
   receptor is a pentamer composed of two different subunits (alpha and beta). - The
   gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) receptor, which is also an inhibitory chloride ion channel. The
   quaternary structure of the GABA receptor is complex; at least four classes of subunits are known
   to exist (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) and there are many variants in each class (for example:
   six variants of the alpha class have already been sequenced). - The serotonin 5HT3 receptor.
   Serotonin is a biogenic hormone that functions as a neurotransmitter, a hormone and a mitogen.
   There are seven major groups of serotonin receptors; six of these groups (5HT1, 5HT2, and 5HT4 to
   5HT7) transduce extracellular signal by activating G proteins, while 5HT3 is a ligand-gated
   cation-specific ion channel which, when activated causes fast, depolarizing responses in neurons.
   - The glutamate receptor, an excitatory cation channel. Glutamate is the main excitatory
   neurotransmitter in the brain. At least three different types of glutamate receptors have been
   described and are named according to their selective agonists (kainate, N-methyl-D-aspartate
   (NMDA) and quisqualate).All known sequences of subunits from neurotransmitter-gated ion-channels
   are structurally related. They are composed of a large extracellular glycosylated N-terminal
   ligand-binding domain, followed by three hydrophobic transmembrane regions which form the ionic
   channel, followed by an intracellular region of variable length. A fourth hydrophobic region is
   found at the C-terminal of the sequence. The sequence of subunits from the AchR, GABA, 5HT3, and
   Gly receptors are clearly evolutionary related and share many regions of sequence similarities.
   These sequence similarities are either absent or very weak in the Glu receptors. In the
   N-terminal extracellular domain of AchR/GABA/5HT3/Gly receptors, there are two conserved cysteine
   residues, which, in AchR, have been shown to form a disulfide bond essential to the tertiary
   structure of the receptor. A number of amino acids between the two disulfide-bonded cysteines are
   also conserved. Therefore this region was used as a signature pattern for this subclass of
   proteins. Consensus pattern: C-x-[LIVMFQ]-x-[LIVMF]-x(2)-[FY]-P-x-D-x(3)-C [The two C's are

  <p>[0694] Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23) (OMPdecase) [1,2] catalyzes the last
   step in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines, the decarboxylation of OMP into UMP. In higher
   eukaryotes OMPdecase is part, with orotatephosphoribosyltransferase, of a bifunctional enzyme,
   while the prokaryotic and fungal OMPdecases are monofunctional protein. Some parts of the
   sequence of OMPdecase are well conserved across species. The best conserved region is located in
   the N-terminal half of OMPdecases and is centered around a lysine residue which is essential for
   the catalytic function of the enzyme. This region has been developed as a signature pattern.

  <p> 376. ATP synthase delta (OSCP) subunit signature </p>
  <p>[0695] ATP synthase (proton-translocating ATPase) (EC 3.6.1.34) [1,2] is a component of the
   cytoplasmic membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria, and the thylakoid
   membrane of chloroplasts. The ATPase complex is composed of an oligomeric transmembrane sector,
   called CF(0), which acts as a proton channel, and a catalytic core, termed coupling factor CF(1).
   One of the subunits of the ATPase complex, known as subunit delta in bacteria and chloroplasts or
   the Oligomycin Sensitivity Conferral Protein (OSCP) in mitochondria, seems to be part of the
   stalk that links CF(0) to CF(1). It either transmits conformational changes from CF(0) into CF(1)
   or is involved in proton conduction [3]. The different delta/OSCP subunits are proteins of
   approximately 200 amino-acid residues - once the transit peptide has been removed in the
   chloroplast and mitochondrial forms - which show only moderate sequence homology. The signature
   pattern used to detect ATPase delta/OSCP subunits is based on a conserved region in the
   C-terminal section of these proteins. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 377. Aspartate and ornithine carbamoyltransferases signature </p>
  <p>[0696] Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.2) (ATCase) catalyzes the conversion of
   aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to carbamoylaspartate, the second step in the de novo
   biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides [1]. In prokaryotes ATCase consists of two subunits: a
   catalytic chain (gene pyrB) and a regulatory chain (gene pyrI), while in eukaryotes it is a
   domain in a multi-functional enzyme (called URA2 in yeast, rudimentary in Drosophila, and CAD in
   mammals [2]) that also catalyzes other steps of the biosynthesis of pyrimidines. Ornithine
   carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3) (OTCase) catalyzes the conversion of ornithine and carbamoyl
   phosphate to citrulline. In mammals this enzyme participates in the urea cycle [3] and is located
   in the mitochondrial matrix. In prokaryotes and eukaryotic microorganisms it is involved in the
   biosynthesis of arginine. In some bacterial species it is also involved in the degradation of
   arginine [4] (the arginine deaminase pathway). It has been shown [5] that these two enzymes are
   evolutionary related. The predicted secondary structure of both enzymes are similar and there are
   some regions of sequence similarities. One of these regions includes three residues which have
   been shown, by crystallographic studies [6], to be implicated in binding the phosphoryl group of
   carbamoyl phosphate. This region was selected as a signature for these enzymes. Consensus
   pattern: F-x-[EK]-x-S-[GT]-R-T[S, R, and the 2nd T bind carbamoyl phosphate] -Note: the residue
   in position 3 of the pattern allows to distinguish between an ATCase (Glu) and an OTCase (Lys). [

  <p> 378. Oleosins signature </p>
  <p>[0697] Oleosins [1] are the proteinaceous components of plants' lipid storage bodies called oil
   bodies. Oil bodies are small droplets (0.2 to 1.5 mu-m in diameter) containing mostly
   triacylglycerol that are surrounded by a phospholipid/oleosin annulus. Oleosins may have a
   structural role in stabilizing the lipid body during dessication of the seed, by preventing
   coalescence of the oil. They may also provide recognition signals for specific lipase anchorage
   in lipolysis during seedling growth. Oleosins are found in the monolayer lipid/water interface of
   oil bodies and probably interact with both the lipid and phospholipid moieties. Oleosins are
   proteins of 16 Kd to 24 Kd and are composed of three domains: an N-terminal hydrophilic region of
   variable length (from 30 to 60 residues); a central hydrophobic domain of about 70 residues and a
   C-terminal amphipathic region of variable length (from 60 to 100 residues). The central
   hydrophobic domain is proposed to be made up of beta-strand structure and to interact with the
   lipids [2]. It is the only domain whose sequence is conserved and therefore a section from that
   domain was selected as a signature pattern. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 380. Orn/DAP/Arg decarboxylases family 2 signatures </p>
  <p>[0699] Pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases acting on ornithine, lysine, arginine and related
   substrates can be classified into two different families on the basis of sequence similarities
   [1,2,3]. The second family consists of: Eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) (ODC).
   ODC catalyzes the transformation of ornithine into putrescine. Prokaryotic diaminopimelic acid
   decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.20) (DAPDC). DAPDC catalyzes the conversion of diaminopimelic acid into
   lysine; the last step in the biosynthesis of lysine. Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci protein
   tabA. tabA is probably involved in the biosynthesis of tabtoxin and is highly similar to DAPDC.
   Bacterial and plant biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.19) (ADC). ADC catalyzes the
   transformation of arginine into agmatine, the first step in the biosynthesis of putrescine from
   arginine. </p>
  <p>[0700] The above proteins, while most probably evolutionary related, do not share extensive
   regions of sequence similarities. Two of the conserved regions were selected as signature
   patterns. The first pattern contains a conserved lysine residue which is known, in mouse ODC [4],
   to be the site of attachment of the pyridoxal-phosphate group. The second pattern contains a
   stretch of three consecutive glycine residues and has been proposed to be part of a
   substrate-binding region [5]. These enzymes are collectively known as group IV decarboxylases
   [3]. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0701] Osteopontin is an acidic phosphorylated glycoprotein of about 40 Kd which is abundant in
   the mineral matrix of bones and which binds tightly to hydroxyapatite [1,2,3]. It is suggested
   that osteopontin might function as a cell attachment factor and could play a key role in the
   adhesion of osteoclasts to the mineral matrix of bone. Osteopontin-K is a kidney protein which is
   highly similar to osteopontin and probably also involved in cell-adhesion. As a signature pattern
   a highly conserved region located at the N-terminal extremity of the mature protein was selected.

  <p> 382. Oxysterol-binding protein family signature </p>
  <p>[0702] A number of eukaryotic proteins that seem to be involved with sterol synthesis and/or
   its regulation have been found [1] to be evolutionary related: Mammalian oxysterol-binding
   protein (OSBP). A protein of about 800 amino-acid residues that binds a variety of oxysterols:
   oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol. OSBP seems to play a complex role in the regulation of
   sterol metabolism. Yeast proteins HES1 and KES1; highly related proteins of 434 residues that
   seem to play a role in ergosterol synthesis. Yeast OSH1, a protein of 859 residues that also
   plays a role in ergosterol synthesis. - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR001w (437 residues). Yeast
   hypothetical protein YHR073w (996 residues). Yeast hypothetical protein YKR003w (448 residues).
   All these proteins contain a moderately conserved domain of about 250 residues located in the
   C-terminal half of OBSP, OSH1 and YHR073w and in the central section of the other proteins. As a
   signature pattern, the best conserved part was selected of this domain, a region that contains a

  <p>[0704] A number of different eukaryotic oxidoreductases that require and bind a molybdopterin
   cofactor have been shown [1] to share a few regions of sequence similarity. These enzymes are:
   Xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.204), which catalyzes the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid
   with the concomitant reduction of NAD. Structurally, this enzyme of about 1300 amino acids
   consists of at least three distinct domains: an N-terminal 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-like iron-sulfur
   binding domain (see &lt;PDOC00175&gt;), a central FAD/NAD-binding domain and a C-terminal
   Mo-pterin domain. Aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1), which catalyzes the oxidation aldehydes into
   acids. Aldehyde oxidase is highly similar to xanthine dehydrogenase in its sequence and domain
   structure. Nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1), which catalyzes the reduction of nitrate to nitrite.
   Structurally, this enzyme of about 900 amino acids consists of an N-terminal Mo-pterin domain, a
   central cytochrome b5-type heme-binding domain (see &lt;PDOC00170&gt;) and a C-terminal
   FAD/NAD-binding cytochrome reductase domain. Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1), which catalyzes the
   oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. Structurally, this enzyme of about 460 amino acids consists of
   an N-terminal cytochrome b5-binding domain followed by a Mo-pterin domain. </p>
  <p>[0705] There are a few conserved regions in the sequence of the molybdopterin-binding domain of
   these enzymes. The pattern used to detect these proteins is based on one of them. It contains a

   NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is an oligomeric enzymatic complex located in the inner
   mitochondrial membrane which also seems to exist in the chloroplast and in cyanobacteria (as a
   NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase). Among the 25 to 30 polypeptide subunits of this bioenergetic
   enzyme complex there is one with a molecular weight of 20 Kd (in mammals) [3], which is a

  <p> 390. p53 tumor antigen signature </p>
  <p>[0709] The p53 tumor antigen [1 to 5, E1,E2] is a protein found in increased amounts in a wide
   variety of transformed cells. It is also detectable in many proliferating nontransformed cells,
   but it is undetectable or present at low levels in resting cells. It is frequently mutated or
   inactivated in many types of cancer. p53 seems to act as a tumor suppressor in some, but probably
   not all, tumor types. p53 is probably involved in cell cycle regulation, and may be a
   trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cellular division by controlling a set of genes
   required for this process. p53 is a phosphoprotein of about 390 amino acids which can be
   subdivided into four domains: a highly charged acidic region of about 75 to 80 residues, a
   hydrophobic proline-rich domain (position 80 to 150), a central region (from 150 to about 300),
   and a highly basic C-terminal region. The sequence of p53 is well conserved in vertebrate
   species; attempts to identify p53 in other eukaryotic philum has so far been unsuccessful. </p>
  <p>[0710] As a signature pattern for p53 a perfectly conserved stretch of 13 residues located in
   the central region of the protein was selected. This region, known as domain IV in [3], is
   involved (along with an adjacent region) in the binding of the large T antigen of SV40. In man
   this region is the focus of a variety of point mutations in cancerous tumors. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0712] Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.5) (PAL) is a key enzyme of plant and fungi
   phenylpropanoid metabolism which is involved in the biosynthesis of a wide variety of secondary
   metabolites such as flavanoids, furanocoumarin phytoalexins and cell wall components. These
   compounds have many important roles in plants during normal growth and in responses to

   trans-cinnamate. Histidine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.3) (histidase) catalyzes the first step in
   histidine degradation, the removal of an ammonia group from histidine to produce urocanic acid.
   The two types of enzymes are functionally and structurally related [1]. They are the only enzymes

  <p>[0716] Protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) (PCMT)[1] (which
   is also known as L-isoaspartyl protein carboxyl methyltransferase)is an enzyme that catalyzes the
   transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the free carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl or
   L-isoaspartyl residues in a variety of peptides and proteins. The enzyme does not act on normal
   L-aspartyl residues L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl are the products of the spontaneous de amidation
   and/or isomerization of normal L-aspartyl and L-asparaginyl residues in proteins. PCMT plays a
   role in the repair and/ordegradation of these damaged proteins; the enzymatic methyl
   esterification of the abnormal residues can lead to their conversion to normal
   L-aspartylresidues. PCMT is a well-conserved and widely distributed cytosolic protein of about
   24Kd. As a signature pattern, a conserved region in the central part of this enzyme has been

  <p>[0717] Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) [1,2] is a protein involved in DNA replication
   by acting as a cofactor for DNA polymerase delta, the polymerase responsible for leading strand
   DNA replication. A similar protein exists in yeast (gene POL30) [3] and is associated with
   polymerase III, the yeast analog of polymerase delta. In baculoviruses the ETL protein has been
   shown [4] to be highly related to PCNA and is probably associated with the viral encoded DNA
   polymerase. An homolog of PCNA is also found in archebacteria. As signatures for this family of
   proteins, two conserved regions were selected located in the N-terminal section. The second one
   has been proposed to bind DNA. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 399. (PDT) Prephenate dehydratase signatures </p>
  <p>[0718] Prephenate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.51) (PDT) catalyzes the decarboxylation of prephenate
   into phenylpyruvate. In microorganisms PDT is involved in the terminal pathway of the
   biosynthesis of phenylalanine. In some bacteria such as Escherichia coli PDT is part of a
   bifunctional enzyme (P-protein) that also catalyzes the transformation of chorismate into
   prephenate (chorismate mutase) while in other bacteria it is a monofunctional enzyme. The
   sequence of monofunctional PDT align well with the C-terminal part of that of P-proteins [1]. As
   signature patterns for PDT two conserved regions were selected. The first region contains a
   conserved threonine which has been said to be essential for the activity of the enzyme in E.

  <p> 401. (PPDK_N_term) PEP-utilizing enzymes signatures </p>
  <p>[0720] A number of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a phosphoryl group from
   phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) via a phospho-histidine intermediate have been shown to be structurally
   related [1,2,3,4]. These enzymes are: Pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase (EC 2.7.9.1) (PPDK). PPDK
   catalyzes the reversible phosphorylation of pyruvate and phosphate by ATP to PEP and diphosphate.
   In plants PPDK function in the direction of the formation of PEP, which is the primary acceptor
   of carbon dioxide in C4 and crassulacean acid metabolism plants. In some bacteria, such as
   Bacteroides symbiosus, PPDK functions in the direction of ATP synthesis. Phosphoenolpyruvate
   synthase (EC 2.7.9.2) (pyruvate,water dikinase). This enzyme catalyzes the reversible
   phosphorylation of pyruvate by ATP to form PEP, AMP and phosphate, an essential step in
   gluconeogenesis when pyruvate and lactate are used as a carbon source.
   Phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.3.9). This is the first enzyme of the
   phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate
   transport system in bacteria. The PTS catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar substrates
   concomitant with their translocation across the cell membrane. The general mechanism of the PTS
   is the following: a phosphoryl group from PEP is transferred to enzyme-I (EI) of PTS which in
   turn transfers it to a phosphoryl carrier protein (HPr). Phospho-HPr then transfers the
   phosphoryl group to a sugar-specific permease. All these enzymes share the same catalytic
   mechanism: they bind PEP and transfer the phosphoryl group from it to a histidine residue. The
   sequence around that residue is highly conserved and can be used as a signature pattern for these
   enzymes. As a second signature pattern a conserved region was selected in the C-terminal part of
   the PEP-utilizing enzymes. The biological significance of this region is not yet known. Consensus

  <p> 402. (PEPCK ATP) Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP) signature </p>
  <p>[0721] Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP) (EC 4.1.1.49) (PEPCK) [1] catalyzes the
   formation of phosphoenolpyruvate by decarboxylation of oxaloacetate while hydrolyzing ATP, a rate
   limiting step in gluconeogenesis (the biosynthesis of glucose). The sequence of this enzyme has
   been obtained from Escherichia coli, yeast, and Trypanosoma brucei; these three sequences are
   evolutionary related and share many regions of similarity. As a signature pattern a highly
   conserved region was selected that contains four acidic residues and which is located in the
   central part of the enzyme. The beginning of the pattern is located about 10 residues to the
   C-terminus of an ATP-binding motif 'A' (P-loop) (see &lt;PDOC00017&gt;) and is also part of the
   ATP-binding domain [2]. Consensus pattern: L-I-G-D-D-E-H-x-W-x-[DE]-x-G-[IV]-x-N Note:

   [2] have been implicated in the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme; the regions around these

  <p> 405. (PFK) Phosphofructokinase signature </p>
  <p>[0724] Phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) (PFK) [1,2] is a key regulatory enzyme in the
   glycolytic pathway. It catalyzes the phosphorylation by ATP of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose
   1,6-bisphosphate. In bacteria PFK is a tetramer of identical 36 Kd subunits. In mammals it is a
   tetramer of 80 Kd subunits. Each 80 Kd subunit consist of two homologous domains which are highly
   related to the bacterial 36 Kd subunits. In Human there are three, tissue-specific, types of PFK
   isozymes: PFKM (muscle), PFKL (liver), and PFKP (platelet). In yeast PFK is an octamer composed
   of four 100 Kd alpha chains (gene PFK1) and four 100 Kd beta chains (gene PFK2); like the
   mammalian 80 Kd subunits, the yeast 100 Kd subunits are composed of two homologous domains. As a
   signature pattern for PFK a region that contains three basic residues involved in
   fructose-6-phosphate binding was selected. Consensus pattern: [RK]-x(4)-G-H-x-Q-[QR]-G-G-x(5)-D-R
   [The R/K, the H and the Q/R are involved in fructose-6-P binding] Note: Escherichia coli has two
   phosphofructokinase isozymes which are encoded by genes pfkA (major) and pfkB (minor). The pfkB
   isozyme is not evolutionary related to other prokaryotic or eukaryotic PFK's (see

  <p> 406. (PGAM) Phosphoglycerate mutase family phosphohistidine signature </p>
  <p>[0725] Phosphoglycerate mutase (EC 5.4.2.1) (PGAM) and bisphosphoglycerate mutase (EC 5.4.2.4)
   (BPGM) are structurally related enzymes which catalyze reactions involving the transfer of
   phospho groups between the three carbon atoms of phosphoglycerate [1,2]. Both enzymes can
   catalyze three different reactions, although in different proportions: The isomerization of
   2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) as
   the primer of the reaction. The synthesis of 2,3-DPG from 1,3-DPG with 3-PGA as a primer. The
   degradation of 2,3-DPG to 3-PGA (phosphatase EC 3.1.3.13 activity). In mammals, PGAM is a dimeric
   protein. There are two isoforms of PGAM: the M (muscle) and B (brain) forms. In yeast, PGAM is a
   tetrameric protein. BPGM is a dimeric protein and is found mainly in erythrocytes where it plays
   a major role in regulating hemoglobin oxygen affinity as a consequence of controlling 2,3-DPG
   concentration. The catalytic mechanism of both PGAM and BPGM involves the formation of a
   phosphohistidine intermediate [3]. The bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase /
   fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (EC 2.7.1.105 and EC 3.1.3.46) (PF2K) [4] catalyzes both the
   synthesis and the degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. PF2K is an important enzyme in the
   regulation of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism. Like PGAM/BPGM, the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase
   reaction involves a phosphohistidine intermediate and the phosphatase domain of PF2K is
   structurally related to PGAM/BPGM. The bacterial enzyme alpha-ribazole-5'-phosphate phosphatase
   (gene cobC) which is involved in cobalamin biosynthesis also belongs to this family [5]. A
   signature pattern was built around the phosphohistidine residue. Consensus pattern:
   [LIVM]-x-R-H-G-[EQ]-x(3)-N [H is the phosphohistidine residue] Note: some organisms harbor a form
   of PGAM independent of 2,3-DPG, this enzyme is not related to the family described above [6]. [

  <p> 407. (PGI) Phosphoglucose isomerase signatures </p>
  <p>[0726] Phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) (PGI) [1,2] is a dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the
   reversible isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. PGI is involved in
   different pathways: in most higher organisms it is involved in glycolysis; in mammals it is
   involved in gluconeogenesis; in plants in carbohydrate biosynthesis; in some bacteria it provides
   a gateway for fructose into the Entner-Doudouroff pathway. PGI has been shown [3] to be identical
   to neuroleukin, a neurotrophic factor which supports the survival of various types of neurons.
   The sequence of PGI from many species ranging from bacteria to mammals is available and has been

   D-glucose 1-phosphate into D-glucose 6-phosphate. PGM participates in both the breakdown and
   synthesis of glucose [1]. Phosphomannomutase (EC 5.4.2.8) (PMM). PMM is an enzyme responsible for
   the conversion of D-mannose 1-phosphate into D-mannose 6-phosphate. PMM is required for different
   biosynthetic pathways in bacteria. For example, in enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli there
   are two different genes coding for this enzyme: rfbK which is involved in the synthesis of the O
   antigen of lipopolysaccharide and cpsG which is required for the synthesis of the M antigen
   capsular polysaccharide [2]. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa PMM (gene algC) is involved in the
   biosynthesis of the alginate layer [3] and in Xanthomonas campestris (gene xanA) it is involved
   in the biosynthesis of xanthan [4]. In Rhizobium strain ngr234 (gene noeK) it is involved in the

   N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate into the 6-phosphate isomer. The catalytic mechanism of both
   PGM and PMM involves the formation of a phosphoserine intermediate [1]. The sequence around the

  <p> 410. PH domain profile </p>
  <p>[0729] The 'pleckstrin homology' (PH) domain is a domain of about 100 residues that occurs in a
   wide range of proteins involved in intracellular signaling or as constituents of the cytoskeleton
   [1 to 7]. The function of this domain is not clear, several putative functions have been
   suggested: - binding to the beta/gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, binding to lipids,
   e.g. phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, binding to phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues,
   attachment to membranes by an unknown mechanism. It is possible that different PH domains have
   totally different ligand requirements. </p>
  <p>[0730] The 3D structure of several PH domains has been determined [8]. All known cases have a
   common structure consisting of two perpendicular anti-parallel beta sheets, followed by a
   C-terminal amphipathic helix. The loops connecting the beta-strands differ greatly in length,
   making the PH domain relatively difficult to detect. There are no totally invariant residues
   within the PH domain. Proteins reported to contain one more PH domains belong to the following
   families: Pleckstrin, the protein where this domain was first detected, is the major substrate of
   protein kinase C in platelets. Pleckstrin is one of the rare proteins to contains two PH domains.

   domain, which has been developed by Toby Gibson at the EMBL, covers the total length of domain.
   Several proteins contain large insertions in the PH domain and are thus difficult to detect with
   this profile. In some of these cases, the profile will align only to one half of the PH domain.
   Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL. But it should be noted that
   while all sequences containing PH domains are detected, not all PH domains are. Some of the split
   domains lie below the cutoff threshold. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Mayer B.J., Ren R., Clark K.L., Baltimore D. Cell

  <p>[0732] Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.11), an eukaryotic intracellular
   enzyme, plays an important role in signal transduction processes [1]. It catalyzes the hydrolysis
   of 1-phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol-3,4,5-triphosphate into the second messenger molecules
   diacylglycerol and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate. This catalytic process is tightly regulated by
   reversible phosphorylation and binding of regulatory proteins [2 to 4]. In mammals, there are at
   least 6 different isoforms of PI-PLC, they differ in their domain structure, their regulation,
   and their tissue distribution. Lower eukaryotes also possess multiple isoforms of PI-PLC. All
   eukaryotic PI-PLCs contain two regions of homology, sometimes referred to as 'X-box' and 'Y-box'.
   The order of these two regions is always the same (NH2-X-Y-COOH), but the spacing is variable. In
   most isoforms, the distance between these two regions is only 50-100 residues but in the gamma
   isoforms one PH domain, two SH2 domains, and one SH3 domain are inserted between the two
   PLC-specific domains. The two conserved regions have been shown to be important for the catalytic
   activity. At the C-terminal of the Y-box, there is a C2 domain (see &lt;PDOC00380&gt;) possibly
   involved in Ca-dependent membrane attachment. Profile analysis shows that sequences with
   significant similarity to the X-box domain occur also in prokaryotic and trypanosome PI-specific
   phospholipases C. Apart from this region, the prokaryotic enzymes show no similarity to their
   eukaryotic counterparts. Two profiles were developed, one covering the X-box, the other the

  <p> 414. (PK) Pyruvate kinase active site signature </p>
  <p>[0734] Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) (PK) [1] catalyzes the final step in glycolysis, the
   conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate with the concomitant phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.
   PK requires both magnesium and potassium ions for its activity. PK is found in all living
   organisms. In vertebrates there are four, tissues specific, isozymes: L (liver), R (red cells),
   M1 (muscle, heart, and brain), and M2 (early fetal tissues). In Escherichia coli there are two
   isozymes: PK-I (gene pykF) and PK-II (gene pykA). All PK isozymes seem to be tetramers of
   identical subunits of about 500 amino acid residues. As a signature pattern for PK a conserved
   region was selected that includes a lysine residue which seems to be the acid/base catalyst
   responsible for the interconversion of pyruvate and enolpyruvate, and a glutamic acid residue
   implicated in the binding of the magnesium ion. Consensus pattern:
   [LIVAC]-x-[LIVM](2)-[SAPCV]-K-[LIV]-E-[NKRST]-x-[DEQHS]-[GSTA]-[LIVM] [K is the active site

  <p> 415. (PLDc) Phospholipase D. Active site motif </p>
  <p>[0735] Phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (PLD) isoforms are activated by
   ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). PLD produces phosphatidic acid from phosphatidylcholine, which
   may be essential for the formation of certain types of transport vesicles or may be constitutive
   vesicular transport to signal transduction pathways. PC-hydrolyzing PLD is a homologue of
   cardiolipin synthase, phosphatidylserine synthase, bacterial PLDs, and viral proteins. Each of
   these appears to possess a domain duplication which is apparent by the presence of two motifs
   containing well-conserved histidine, lysine, and/or asparagine residues which may contribute to
   the active site. aspartic acid. An E. coli endonuclease (nuc) and similar proteins appear to be
   PLD homologues but possess only one of these motifs. The profile contained here represents only
   the putative active site regions, since an accurate multiple alignment of the repeat units has

  <p> 416. (PMI type1) Phosphomannose isomerase type I signatures </p>
  <p>[0736] Phosphomannose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.8) (PMI) [1,2] is the enzyme that catalyzes the
   interconversion of mannose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. In eukaryotes, it is involved in
   the synthesis of GDP-mannose which is a constituent of N- and O-linked glycans as well as GPI
   anchors. In prokaryotes, it is involved in a variety of pathways including capsular
   polysaccharide biosynthesis and D-mannose metabolism. Three classes of PMI have been defined on
   the basis of sequence similarities [1]. The first class comprises all known eukaryotic PMI as
   well as the enzyme encoded by the manA gene in enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli. Class I
   PMI's are proteins of about 42 to 50 Kd which bind a zinc ion essential for their activity. As
   signature patterns for class I PMI, two conserved regions were selected. The first one is located
   in the N-terminal section of these proteins, the second in the C-terminal half. Both patterns
   contain a residue involved [3] in the binding of the zinc ion. Consensus pattern:

   phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.3) (UdRPase) from bacteria (gene udp) and mammals. Catalyzes the cleavage

  <p> 418. (PP2C) Protein phosphatase 2C signature </p>
  <p>[0738] Protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) is one of the four major classes of mammalian
   serine/threonine specific protein phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.16). PP2C [1] is a monomeric enzyme of
   about 42 Kd which shows broad substrate specificity and is dependent on divalent cations (mainly
   manganese and magnesium) for its activity. Its exact physiological role is still unclear. Three
   isozymes are currently known in mammals: PP2C-alpha, -beta and -gamma. In yeast, there are at
   least four PP2C homologs: phosphatase PTC1 [2] which has weak tyrosine phosphatase activity in
   addition to its activity on serines, phosphatases PTC2 and PTC3, and hypothetical protein
   YBR125c. Isozymes of PP2C are also known from Arabidopsis thaliana (ABI1, PPH1), Caenorhabditis
   elegans (FEM-2, F42G9.1, T23F11.1), Leishmania chagasi and Paramecium tetraurelia. In Arabidopsis
   thaliana, the kinase associated protein phosphatase (KAPP) [3] is an enzyme that dephosphorylates
   the Ser/Thr receptor-like kinase RLK5 and which contains a C-terminal PP2C domain. PP2C does not
   seem to be evolutionary related to the main family of serine/threonine phosphatases: PP1, PP2A
   and PP2B . However, it is significantly similar to the catalytic subunit of pyruvate
   dehydrogenase phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.43) (PDPC) [4], which catalyzes dephosphorylation and
   concomitant reactivation of the alpha subunit of the E1 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
   complex. PDPC is a mitochondrial enzyme and, like PP2C, is magnesium-dependent. As a signature
   pattern, the best conserved region was selected which is located in the N-terminal part and
   contains a perfectly conserved tripeptide. This region includes a conserved aspartate residue
   involved in divalent cation binding [5]. Consensus pattern:
   [LIVMFY]-[LIVMFYA]-[GSAC]-[LIVM]-[FYC]-D-G-H-[GAV] -Note: PP2C belongs [6] to a superfamily which
   also includes bacterial proteins such as Bacillus spoIIE, rsbU and rsbW, Synechocystis PCC 6803
   icfG as well as a domain in fungal adenylate cyclases. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Wenk J., Trompeter H.-I., Pettrich

  <p> 419. (PPTA) Protein prenyltransferases alpha subunit repeat signature </p>
  <p>[0739] Protein prenyltransferases catalyze the transfer of an isoprenyl moiety to a cysteine
   four residues from the C-terminus of several proteins. They are heterodimeric enzymes consisting
   of alpha and beta subunits. The alpha subunit is thought to participate in a stable complex with
   the isoprenyl substrate; the beta subunit binds the peptide substrate. Distinct protein
   prenyltransferases might share a common alpha subunit. Both the alpha and beta subunit show
   repetitive sequence motifs [1]. These repeats have distinct structural and functional
   implications and are unrelated to each other. Known protein prenyltransferase alpha subunits are:
   Mammalian protein farnesyltransferase alpha subunit. Yeast protein RAM2, a protein
   farnesyltransferase alpha subunit. Yeast protein BET4, a protein geranylgeranyltransferase alpha
   subunit. The conserved domain of the alpha subunit consists of about 34 amino acids and is
   repeated five times. It contains an invariant tryptophan possibly involved in heterodimerization
   with the conserved phenylalanines in the repeated domains of the beta subunits, via hydrophobic
   bonds. The signature pattern for this domain is centered on the invariant tryptophan. Consensus

  <p> 420. (PR55) Protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit PR55 signatures </p>
  <p>[0740] Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in many aspects
   of cellular function including the regulation of metabolic enzymes and proteins involved in
   signal transduction. PP2A is a trimeric enzyme that consists of a core composed of a catalytic
   subunit associated with a 65 Kd regulatory subunit (PR65), also called subunit A; this complex
   then associates with a third variable subunit (subunit B), which confers distinct properties to
   the holoenzyme [1]. One of the forms of the variable subunit is a 55 Kd protein (PR55) which is
   highly conserved in mammals - where three isoforms are known to exist -, Drosophila and yeast
   (gene CDC55). This subunit could perform a substrate recognition function or be responsible for
   targeting the enzyme complex to the appropriate subcellular compartment. As signature patterns,
   two perfectly conserved sequences of 15 residues were selected; one located in the N-terminal
   region, the other in the center of the protein. Consensus pattern: E-F-D-Y-L-K-S-L-E-I-E-E-K-I-N

   Calvin's reductive pentose phosphate cycle which is the major route by which carbon dioxide is
   assimilated and reduced by autotrophic organisms. PRK catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation
   of ribulose 5-phosphate into ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate which is the substrate for RubisCO. PRK's
   of diverse origins show different properties with respect to the size of the protein, the subunit
   structure, or the enzymatic regulation. However an alignment of the sequences of PRK from plants,
   algae, photosynthetic and chemoautotrophic bacteria shows that there are a few regions of
   sequence similarity. As a signature pattern one of these regions was selected. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0743] Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (EC 2.7.6.1) (PRPP synthetase) catalyzes the
   formation of PRPP from ATP and ribose 5-phosphate. PRPP is then used in various biosynthetic
   pathways, as for example in the formation of purines, pyrimidines, histidine and tryptophan. PRPP
   synthetase requires inorganic phosphate and magnesium ions for its stability and activity. In
   mammals, three isozymes of PRPP synthetase are found; in yeast there are at least four isozymes.
   As a signature pattern for this enzyme, a very conserved region was selected that has been
   suggested to be involved in binding divalent cations [1]. This region contains two conserved
   aspartic acid residues as well as a histidine, which are all potential ligands for a cation such

  <p> 427. Pumilio-family RNA binding domains (aka PUM-HD, Pumilio homology domain) </p>
  <p>[0749] Puf domains are necessary and sufficient for sequence specific RNA binding in fly
   Pumilio and worm FBF-1 and FBF-2. Both proteins function as translational repressors in early
   embryonic development by binding sequences in the 3' UTR of target mRNAs (e.g. the nanos response
   element (NRE) in fly Hunchback mRNA, or the point mutation element (PME) in worm fem-3 mRNA).
   Other proteins that contain Puf domains are also plausible RNA binding proteins. JSN1_YEAST, for
   instance, appears to also contain a single RRM domain by HMM analysis. Puf domains usually occur
   as a tandem repeat of 8 domains. The Pfam model does not necessarily recognize all 8 domains in
   all sequences; some sequences appear to have 5 or 6 domains on initial analysis, but further
   analysis suggests the presence of additional divergent domains. [1] <ref type="npl">Zhang B, Gallegos M, Puoti A,

  <p>[0756] Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.29) (PTH) is a bacterial enzyme that cleaves
   peptidyl-tRNA or N-acyl-aminoacyl-tRNA to yield free peptides or N-acyl-amino acids and tRNA. The
   natural substrate for this enzyme may be peptidyl-tRNA which drop off the ribosome during protein
   synthesis [1,2]. Bacterial PTH has been found [2,3] to be evolutionary related to yeast
   hypothetical protein YHR189w. PTH and YHR189w are proteins of about 200 amino acid residues. As

  <p> 436. (Peptidase M17) Cytosol aminopeptidase signature </p>
  <p>[0757] Cytosol aminopeptidase is a eukaryotic cytosolic zinc-dependent exopeptidase that
   catalyzes the removal of unsubstituted amino-acid residues from the N-terminus of proteins. This
   enzyme is often known as leucine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1) (LAP) but has been shown [1] to be
   identical with prolyl aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.5). Cytosol aminopeptidase is a hexamer of
   identical chains, each of which binds two zinc ions. Cytosol aminopeptidase is highly similar to
   Escherichia coli pepA, a manganese dependent aminopeptidase. Residues involved in zinc
   ion-binding [2] in the mammalian enzyme are absolutely conserved in pepA where they presumably
   bind manganese. A cytosol aminopeptidase from Rickettsia prowazekii [3] and one from Arabidopsis
   thaliana also belong to this family. As a signature pattern for these enzymes, a perfectly
   conserved octapeptide was selected which contains two residues involved in binding metal ions: an
   aspartate and a glutamate. Consensus pattern: N-T-D-A-E-G-R-L [The D and the E are zinc/manganese
   ligands] Note: these proteins belong to family M17 in the classification of peptidases [4,E1]. [

  <p>[0763] Phosphoribosyltransferases (PRT) are enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of
   beta-n-5'-monophosphates from phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) and an enzyme specific amine. A
   number of PRT's are involved in the biosynthesis of purine. pyrimidine, and pyridine nucleotides,
   or in the salvage of purines and pyrimidines. These enzymes are: Adenine
   phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7) (APRT), which is involved in purine salvage.
   Hypoxanthine-guanine or hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8) (HGPRT or HPRT),
   which are involved in purine salvage. Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.10) (OPRT),
   which is involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis. Amido phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.14),
   which is involved in purine biosynthesis. Xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC
   2.4.2.22) (XGPRT), which is involved in purine salvage. In the sequence of all these enzymes

  <p> 443. (Pro CA) </p>
  <p> Prokaryotic-type carbonic anhydrases signatures </p>
  <p>[0764] Carbonic anhydrases (EC 4.2.1.1) (CA) are zinc metalloenzymes which catalyze the
   reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. In Escherichia coli, CA (gene cynT) is involved in
   recycling carbon dioxide formed in the bicarbonate-dependent decomposition of cyanate by cyanase
   (gene cynS). By this action, it prevents the depletion of cellular bicarbonate [1]. In
   photosynthetic bacteria and plant chloroplast, CA is essential to inorganic carbon fixation [2].
   Prokaryotic and plant chloroplast CA are structurally and evolutionary related and form a family
   distinct from the one which groups the many different forms of eukaryotic CA's (see
   &lt;PDOC00146&gt;). Hypothetical proteins yadF from Escherichia coli and HI1301 from Haemophilus
   influenzae also belong to this family. Two signature patterns were developed for this family of

   (cysteine and histidine). Consensus pattern: C-[SA]-D-S-R-[LIVM]-x-[AP] Consensus pattern:

  <p> Prolyl oligopeptidase family serine active site </p>
  <p>[0765] The prolyl oligopeptidase family [1,2,3] consist of a number of evolutionary related
   peptidases whose catalytic activity seems to be provided by a charge relay system similar to that
   of the trypsin family of serine proteases, but which evolved by independent convergent evolution.
   The known members of this family are listed below. Prolyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26) (PE) (also
   called post-proline cleaving enzyme). PE is an enzyme that cleaves peptide bonds on the
   C-terminal side of prolyl residues. The sequence of PE has been obtained from a mammalian species
   (pig) and from bacteria (Flavobacterium meningosepticum and Aeromonas hydrophila); there is a
   high degree of sequence conservation between these sequences. Escherichia coli protease II (EC
   3.4.21.83) (oligopeptidase B) (gene prtB) which cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of
   lysyl and argininyl residues. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5) (DPP IV). DPP IV is an enzyme
   that removes N-terminal dipeptides sequentially from polypeptides having unsubstituted N-termini
   provided that the penultimate residue is proline. Yeast vacuolar dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A
   (DPAP A) (gene: STE13) which is responsible for the proteolytic maturation of the alpha-factor
   precursor. Yeast vacuolar dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAP B) (gene: DAP2).
   Acylamino-acid-releasing enzyme (EC 3.4.19.1) (acyl-peptide hydrolase). This enzyme catalyzes the
   hydrolysis of the amino-terminal peptide bond of an N-acetylated protein to generate a
   N-acetylated amino acid and a protein with a free amino-terminus. </p>
  <p>[0766] A conserved serine residue has experimentally been shown (in E.coli proteasell as well
   as in pig and bacterial PE) to be necessary for the catalytic mechanism. This serine, which is
   part of the catalytic triad (Ser, His, Asp), is generally located about 150 residues away from
   the C-terminal extremity of these enzymes (which are all proteins that contains about 700 to 800
   amino acids). Consensus pattern: D-x(3)-A-x(3)-[LIVMFYW]-x(14)-G-x-S-x-G-G-[LIVMFYW](2) [S is the

   hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) which is formed principally as the product of the many
   biosynthetic reactions that utilize ATP. All known Ppases require the presence of divalent metal
   cations, with magnesium conferring the highest activity. Among other residues, a lysine has been
   postulated to be part or close to the active site. PPases have been sequenced from bacteria such
   as Escherichia coli (homohexamer), thermophilic bacteria PS-3 and Thermus thermophilus, from the
   archaebacteria Thermoplasma acidophilum, from fungi (homodimer), from a plant, and from bovine
   retina. In yeast, a mitochondrial isoform of PPase has been characterized which seems to be
   involved in energy production and whose activity is stimulated by uncouplers of ATP synthesis. </p>

  <p>[0772] Signal peptidases I signatures. </p>
  <p>[0773] Signal peptidases (SPases) [1] (aka leader peptidases) remove the signal peptides from
   secretory proteins. In prokaryotes three types of SPasesare known: type I (gene lepB) which is
   responsible for the processing of the majority of exported pre-proteins; type II (gene lsp) which
   only process lipoproteins, and a third type involved in the processing of pili subunits. SPase I
   (EC 3.4.21.89) is an integral membrane protein that is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by
   one (in B. subtilis) or two (in E. coli) N-terminal transmembrane domains with the main part of
   the protein protuding in the periplasmic space. Two residues have been shown [2,3] to be
   essential for the catalytic activity of SPase I: a serine and an lysine. SPase I is evolutionary
   related to the yeast mitochondrial inner membrane protease subunit 1 and 2 (genes IMP1 and IMP2)
   which catalyze the removal of signal peptides required for the targeting of proteins from the
   mitochondrial matrix, across the inner membrane, into the inter-membrane space [4].In eukaryotes
   the removal of signal peptides is effected by an oligomeric enzymatic complex composed of at
   least five subunits: the signal peptidase complex (SPC). The SPC is located in the endoplasmic
   reticulum membrane. Two components of mammalian SPC, the 18 Kd (SPC 18) and the 21 Kd (SPC21)
   subunits as well as the yeast SEC11 subunit have been shown [5] to share regions of sequence
   similarity with prokaryotic SPases I and yeast IMP1/IMP2. Three signature patterns have been
   developed for these proteins. The first signature contains the putative active site serine, the
   second signature contains the putative active site lysine which is not conserved in the SPC
   subunits, and the third signature corresponds to a conserved region of unknown biological
   significance which is located in the C-terminal section of all these proteins. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 449. (Peptidase C1) Eukaryotic thiol (cysteine) proteases active sites. </p>
  <p>[0774] Eukaryotic thiol proteases (EC 3.4.22.-) [1] are a family of proteolytic enzymes which
   contain an active site cysteine. Catalysis proceeds through a thioester intermediate and is
   facilitated by a nearby histidine side chain; an asparagine completes the essential catalytic
   triad. The proteases which are currently known to belong to this family are listed below
   (references are only provided for recently determined sequences). - Vertebrate lysosomal
   cathepsins B (EC 3.4.22.1), H (EC 3.4.22.16), L (EC 3.4.22.15), and S (EC 3.4.22.27) [2]. -
   Vertebrate lysosomal dipeptidyl peptidase I (EC 3.4.14.1) (also known as cathepsin C) [2]. -
   Vertebrate calpains (EC 3.4.22.17). Calpains are intracellular calcium- activated thiol protease
   that contain both a N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal calcium-binding domain. -
   Mammalian cathepsin K, which seems involved in osteoclastic bone resorption [3]. - Human
   cathepsin O [4]. - Bleomycin hydrolase. An enzyme that catalyzes the inactivation of the
   antitumor drug BLM (a glycopeptide). - Plant enzymes: barley aleurain (EC 3.4.22.16), EP-B1/B4;
   kidney bean EP-C1, rice bean SH-EP; kiwi fruit actinidin (EC 3.4.22.14); papaya latex papain (EC
   3.4.22.2), chymopapain (EC 3.4.22.6), caricain (EC 3.4.22.30), and proteinase IV (EC 3.4.22.25);
   pea turgor-responsive protein 15A; pineapple stem bromelain (EC 3.4.22.32); rape COT44; rice
   oryzain alpha, beta, and gamma; tomato low-temperature induced, Arabidopsis thaliana A494, RD19A
   and RD21A. - House-dust mites allergens DerP1 and EurM1. - Cathepsin B-like proteinases from the
   worms Caenorhabditis elegans (genes gcp-1, cpr-3, cpr-4, cpr-5 and cpr-6), Schistosoma mansoni
   (antigen SM31) and Japonica (antigen SJ31), Haemonchus contortus (genes AC-1 and AC-2), and
   Ostertagia ostertagi (CP-1 and CP-3). - Slime mold cysteine proteinases CP1 and CP2. - Cruzipain
   from Trypanosoma cruzi and brucei. - Throphozoite cysteine proteinase (TCP) from various
   Plasmodium species. - Proteases from Leishmania mexicana, Theileria annulata and Theileria parva.
   - Baculoviruses cathepsin-like enzyme (v-cath). - Drosophila small optic lobes protein (gene
   sol), a neuronal protein that contains a calpain-like domain. - Yeast thiol protease
   BLH1/YCP1/LAP3. - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C06G4.2, a calpain-like protein.
   Two bacterial peptidases are also part of this family: - Aminopeptidase C from Lactococcus lactis
   (gene pepC) [5]. - Thiol protease tpr from Porphyromonas gingivalis. Three other proteins are
   structurally related to this family, but may have lost their proteolytic activity. - Soybean oil
   body protein P34. This protein has its active site cysteine replaced by a glycine. - Rat testin,
   a sertoli cell secretory protein highly similar to cathepsin L but with the active site cysteine
   is replaced by a serine. Rat testin should not be confused with mouse testin which is a
   LIM-domain protein (see &lt;PDOC00382&gt;).- Plasmodium falciparum serine-repeat protein (SERA),
   the major blood stage antigen. This protein of 111 Kd possesses a C-terminal thiol-protease-like
   domain [6], but the active site cysteine is replaced by a serine. The sequences around the three
   active site residues are well conserved and can be used as signature patterns. Consensus pattern:
   Q-x(3)-[GE]-x-C-[YW]-x(2)-[STAGC]-[STAGCV] [C is the active site residue]- Note: the residue in
   position 4 of the pattern is almost always cysteine; the only exceptions are calpains (Leu),
   bleomycin hydrolase (Ser) and yeast YCP1 (Ser). -Note: the residue in position 5 of the pattern
   is always Gly except in papaya protease IV where it is Glu. Consensus pattern:
   [LIVMGSTAN]-x-H-[GSACE]-[LIVM]-x-[LIVMAT](2)-G-x-[GSADNH] [H is the active site residue]-

   and uncharged. All MAP studied to date are monomeric proteins that require cobalt ions for

   residues shown, in the Escherichia coli MAP [3],to be involved in cobalt-binding. The first
   family consists of enzymes from prokaryotes as well as eukaryoticMAP-1, while the second group is
   made up of archebacterial MAP and eukaryoticMAP-2. The second subfamily also includes proteins
   which do not seem to be MAP, but that are clearly evolutionary related such as mouse

  <p> 451. Cytochrome P450 cysteine heme-iron ligand signature </p>
  <p>[0777] Cytochrome P450's [1,2,3,E1] are a group of enzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism
   of a high number of natural compounds (such as steroids, fatty acids, prostaglandins,
   leukotrienes, etc) as well as drugs, carcinogens and mutagens. Based on sequence similarities,
   P450's have been classified into about forty different families [4,5]. P450's are proteins of 400
   to 530 amino acids; the only exception is Bacillus BM-3 (CYP102) which is a protein of
   1048residues that contains a N-terminal P450 domain followed by a reductase domain. P450's are
   heme proteins. A conserved cysteine residue in the C-terminal part of P450's is involved in
   binding the heme iron in the fifth coordination site. From a region around this residue, a ten

  <p> 454. Peroxidases signatures </p>
  <p>[0781] Peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.-) [1] are heme-binding enzymes that carry out a variety of
   biosynthetic and degradative functions using hydrogen peroxide as the electron acceptor.
   Peroxidases are widely distributed throughout bacteria, fungi, plants, and vertebrates. In
   peroxidases the heme prosthetic group is protoporphyrin IX and the fifth ligand of the heme iron
   is a histidine (known as the proximal histidine). Another histidine residue (the distal
   histidine) serves as an acid-base catalyst in the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the
   enzyme. The regions around these two active site residues are more or less conserved in a
   majority of peroxidases [2,3]. The enzymes in which one or both of these regions can be found are
   listed below. - Yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.5). - Myeloperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.7)
   (MPO). MPO is found in granulocytes and monocytes and plays a major role in the oxygen-dependent
   microbicidal system of neutrophils.- Lactoperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) (LPO). LPO is a milk protein
   which acts as an antimicrobial agent. - Eosinophil peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) (EPO). An enzyme
   found in the cytoplasmic granules of eosinophils. - Thyroid peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.8) (TPO). TPO
   plays a central role in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. It catalyzes the iodination and
   coupling of the hormonogenic tyrosines in thyroglobulin to yield the thyroid hormones T3 and T4.
   - Fungal ligninases. Ligninase catalyzes the first step in the degradation of lignin. It
   depolymerizes lignin by catalyzing the C(alpha)-C(beta) cleavage of the propyl side chains of
   lignin. - Plant peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.7). Plants expresses a large numbers of isozymes of
   peroxidases. Some of them play a role in cell-suberization by catalyzing the deposition of the
   aromatic residues of suberin on the cell wall, some are expressed as a defense response toward
   wounding, others are involved in the metabolism of auxin and the biosynthesis of lignin. -
   Prokaryotic catalase-peroxidases. Some bacterial species produce enzymes that exhibit both
   catalase and broad-spectrum peroxidase activities [4]. Examples of such enzymes are: catalase HP
   I from Escherichia coli (gene katG) and perA from Bacillus stearothermophilus. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 455. pfkB family of carbohydrate kinases signatures </p>
  <p>[0782] It has been shown [1,2,3] that the following carbohydrate and purine kinasesare
   evolutionary related and can be grouped into a single family, which isknown [1] as the 'pfkB
   family': - Fructokinase (EC 2.7.1.4) (gene scrK). - 6-phosphofructokinase isozyme 2 (EC 2.7.1.11)
   (phosphofructokinase-2) (gene pfkB). pfkB is a minor phosphofructokinase isozyme in Escherichia
   coli and is not evolutionary related to the major isozyme (gene pfkA). Plants
   6-phosphofructokinase also belong to this family. - Ribokinase (EC 2.7.1.15) (gene rbsK). -
   Adenosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.20) (gene ADK). - 2-dehydro-3-deoxygluconokinase (EC 2.7.1.45) (gene:
   kdgK). - 1-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.56) (fructose 1-phosphate kinase) (gene fruK). -
   Inosine-guanosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.73) (gene gsk). - Tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (EC 2.7.1.144)
   (phosphotagatokinase) (gene lacC). - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yeiC. - Escherichia
   coli hypothetical protein yeiI. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhfQ. - Escherichia coli
   hypothetical protein yihV. - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yxdC. - Yeast hypothetical
   protein YJR105w.All the above kinases are proteins of from 280 to 430 amino acid residues that
   share a few region of sequence similarity. Two of these regions were selected as signature
   patterns. The first pattern is based on a region rich in glycine which is located in the
   N-terminal section of these enzymes; while the second pattern is based on a conserved region in
   the C-terminal section. Consensus pattern: [AG]-G-x(0,1)-[GAP]-x-N-x-[STA]-x(6)-[GS]-x(9)-G-

  <p> 456. Phospholipase A2 active sites signatures </p>
  <p>[0783] Phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) (PA2) [1,2] is an enzyme which releases fatty acids from
   the second carbon group of glycerol. PA2's are small and rigid proteins of 120 amino-acid
   residues that have four to seven disulfide bonds.PA2 binds a calcium ion which is required for
   activity. The side chains of two conserved residues, a histidine and an aspartic acid,
   participate in a 'catalytic network'. Many PA2's have been sequenced from snakes, lizards, bees
   and mammals. In the latter, there are at least four forms: pancreatic, membrane-associated as
   well as two less characterized forms. The venom of most snakes contains multiple forms of PA2.
   Some of them are presynaptic neurotoxins which inhibit neuromuscular transmission by blocking
   acetylcholine release from the nerve termini. Two different signature patterns were derived for
   PA2's. The first is centered on the active site histidine and contains three cysteines involved
   in disulfide bonds. The second is centered on the active site aspartic acid and also contains
   three cysteines involved in disulfide bonds. Consensus pattern: C-C-x(2)-H-x(2)-C [H is the
   active site residue] This pattern will not detect some snake toxins homologous with PA2 but which
   have lost their catalytic activity as well as otoconin-22, a Xenopus protein from the aragonitic
   otoconia which is also unlikely to be enzymatically active. Consensus pattern:

   metabolism. They catalyze the formation of glucose 1-phosphatefrom polyglucose such as glycogen,
   starch or maltodextrin. Enzymes from different sources differ in their regulatory mechanisms and
   their natural substrates. However, all known phosphorylases share catalytic and structural
   properties. They are pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzymes; the pyridoxal-P group is attached to

  <p> 458. Protein kinases signatures and profile </p>
  <p>[0785] Eukaryotic protein kinases [1 to 5] are enzymes that belong to a very extensive family
   of proteins which share a conserved catalytic core common toboth serine/threonine and tyrosine
   protein kinases. There are a number ofconserved regions in the catalytic domain of protein
   kinases. Two of these regions were selected to build signature patterns. The first region, which
   is located in the N-terminal extremity of the catalytic domain, is a glycine-rich stretch of
   residues in the vicinity of a lysine residue, which has been shown to be involved in ATP binding.
   The second region, which is located in the central part of the catalytic domain, contains a
   conserved aspartic acid residue which is important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme [6];
   Two signature patterns were derived for that region: one specific for serine/threonine kinases
   and the other for tyrosine kinases. A profile was also developed which is based on the alignment
   in [1] and covers the entire catalytic domain. Consensus pattern:
   [LIV]-G-{P}-G-{P}-[FYWMGSTNH]-[SGA]-{PW}-[LIVCAT]-{PD}-x-[GSTACLIVMFY]-x(5,18)-[LIVMFYWCSTAR]-[AIVP]-[LIVMFAGCKR]-K
   [K binds ATP]. The majority of known protein kinases belong to the class detected by this
   pattern, but it fails to find a number of them, especially viral kinases which are quite
   divergent in this region and are completely missed by this pattern. Consensus pattern:
   [LIVMFYC]-x-[HY]-x-D-[LIVMFY]-K-x(2)-N-[LIVMFYCT](3) [D is an active site residue]. Most serine/
   threonine specific protein kinases belong to this class detected by the pattern with 10
   exceptions (half of them viral kinases) and also Epstein-Barr virus BGLF4 and Drosophila ninaC
   which have respectively Ser and Arg instead of the conserved Lys and which are therefore detected
   by the tyrosine kinase specific pattern described below. Consensus pattern:
   [LIVMFYC]-x-[HY]-x-D-[LIVMFY]-[RSTAC]-x(2)-N-[LIVMFYC](3) [D is an active site residue] ALL
   tyrosine specific protein kinases with the exception of human ERBB3 and mouse blk belong to this
   class detected by the pattern. This pattern will also detect most bacterial aminoglycoside
   phosphotransferases [8,9] and herpesviruses gangciclovir kinases [10]; which are proteins
   structurally and evolutionary related to protein kinases. This profile also detects receptor
   guanylate cyclases and 2-5A-dependent ribonucleases. Sequence similarities between these two
   families and the eukaryotic protein kinase family have been noticed before. It also detects
   Arabidopsis thaliana kinase- like protein TMKL1 which seems to have lost its catalytic activity.
   If a protein analyzed includes the two protein kinase signatures, the probability of it being a
   protein kinase is close to 100%. Eukaryotic-type protein kinases have also been found in
   prokaryotes such as Myxococcus xanthus [11] and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Hanks S.K.,

  <p> Receptor tyrosine kinase class II signature </p>
  <p> [0786] A number of growth factors stimulate mitogenesis by interacting with a familyof cell
   surface receptors which possess an intrinsic, ligand-sensitive, protein tyrosine kinase activity
   [1]. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)all share the same topology: an extracellular
   ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. However
   they can be classified into at least five groups. The prototype for class II RTK's is the insulin
   receptor, a heterotetramer of two alpha and two beta chains linked by disulfide bonds. The alpha
   and beta chains are cleavage products of a precursor molecule. The alpha chain contains the
   ligand binding site, the beta chain transverses the membrane and contains the tyrosine protein
   kinase domain. The receptors currently known to belong to class II are: - Insulin receptor from
   vertebrates. - Insulin growth factor I receptor from mammals. - Insulin receptor-related receptor
   (IRR), which is most probably a receptor for a peptide belonging to the insulin family. - Insects
   insulin-like receptors. - Molluscan insulin-related peptide(s) receptor (MIP-R). - Insulin-like
   peptide receptor from Branchiostoma lanceolatum. - The Drosophila developmental protein
   sevenless, a putative receptor for positional information required for the formation of the R7
   photoreceptor cells. - The trk family of receptors (NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3), which are high
   affinity receptors for nerve growth factor and related neurotrophic factors (BDNF and NT-3).And
   the following uncharacterized receptors: - ROS. - LTK (TYK1). - EDDR1 (cak, TRKE, RTK6). - NTRK3
   (Tyro10, TKT). - A sponge putative receptor tyrosine kinase. While only the insulin and the
   insulin growth factor I receptors are known to exist in the tetrameric conformation specific to
   class II RTK's, all the above proteins share extensive homologies in their kinase domain,
   especially around the putative site of autophosphorylation. Hence, a signature pattern was
   developed for this class of RTK's, which includes the tyrosine residue, itself probably
   autophosphorylated. Consensus pattern: [DN]-[LIV]-Y-x(3)-Y-Y-R [The second Y is the

  <p> Receptor tyrosine kinase class III signature </p>
  <p>[0787] A number of growth factors stimulate mitogenesis by interacting with a family of cell
   surface receptors which possess an intrinsic, ligand-sensitive, protein tyrosine kinase activity
   [1]. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)all share the same topology: an extracellular
   ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. However
   they can be classified into at least five groups. The class III RTK's are characterized by the
   presence of five to seven immunoglobulin-like domains [2] in their extracellular section. Their
   kinase domain differs from that of other RTK's by the insertion of a stretch of 70 to 100
   hydrophilic residues in the middle ofthis domain. The receptors currently known to belong to
   class III are: - Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R). PDGF-R exists as a homo- or
   heterodimer of two related chains: alpha and beta [3]. - Macrophage colony stimulating factor
   receptor (CSF-1-R) (also known as the fms oncogene). - Stem cell factor (mast cell growth factor)
   receptor (also known as the kit oncogene). - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors
   Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR [4]. - Fl cytokine receptor Flk-2/Flt-3 [5]. - The putative receptor Flt-4
   [7]. a signature pattern Was developed for this class of RTK's which is based on a conserved

  <p> Receptor tyrosine kinase class V signatures </p>
  <p>[0788] A number of growth factors stimulate mitogenesis by interacting with a familyof cell
   surface receptors which possess an intrinsic, ligand-sensitive, protein tyrosine kinase activity
   [1]. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)all share the same topology: an extracellular
   ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. However
   they can be classified into at least five groups on the basis of sequence similarities. The
   extracellular domain of class V RTK's consist of a region of about 300amino acids, amongst which
   16 conserved cysteines probably involved in disulfide bonds; this region is followed by two
   copies of a fibronectin typeIII domain. The ligands for these receptors are proteins of about 200
   to 300residues collectively known as Ephrins. The receptors currently known to belong to class V
   are [2,3,E1]: - EPHA1 (Eph-1; Esk). - EPHA2 (Eck; Mpk-5; Sek-2). - EPHA3 (Etk-1; Hek; Mek4;
   Tyro4; Rek4; Cek4). - EPHA4 (Sek; Hek8; Mpk-3; Cek8). - EPHA5 (Ehk-1; Hek7; Bsk; Cek7). - EPHA6

   Myk-1). - EPHB5 (Cek9).The EPHA subtype receptors bind to GPI-anchored ephrins while the EPHB
   subtype receptors bind to type-I membrane ephrins. Two signature patterns were developed for this
   class of RTK's, which each include some of the conserved cysteine residues. Consensus pattern:

   internal disulfide bonds. They are found in seeds but also in the cell wall of leaves [2].
   Thionins are processed from larger precursor proteins [3]. Crambin [4], a hydrophobic plant seed

  <p> 461. Polyprenyl synthetases signatures </p>
  <p>[0790] A variety of isoprenoid compounds are synthesized by various organisms. For example in
   eukaryotes the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is responsible for the synthesis of a variety of
   end products including cholesterol, dolichol, ubiquinone or coenzyme Q. In bacteria this pathway
   leads to the synthesis of isopentenyl tRNA, isoprenoid quinones, and sugar carrier lipids. Among
   the enzymes that participate in that pathway, are a number of polyprenyl synthetase enzymes which
   catalyze a 1'4-condensation between 5 carbon isoprene units. Currently the sequence of some of
   these enzymes is known: - Eukaryotic farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (FPP synthetase) (EC
   2.5.1.1/EC 2.5.1.10) which catalyzes the sequential condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate
   (IPP) with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), and then with the resultant geranyl pyrophosphate
   to form farnesyl pyrophosphate. FPP synthetase is a cytoplasmic dimeric enzyme. - Prokaryotic
   farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (gene ispA). - Prokaryotic octaprenyl diphosphate synthase
   (gene ispB). - Prokaryotic heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.30). - Eukaryotic
   geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthetase (GGPP synthetase) (EC 2.5.1.1 / EC 2.5.1.10 / EC
   2.5.1.29) which catalyzes the sequential addition of the three molecules of IPP onto DMAPP to
   form geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. In plants GGPP synthase is a chloroplast enzyme involved in
   the biosynthesis of terpenoids; in fungi, such as Neurospora crassa (gene al-3), this enzyme is
   involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids. - Prokaryotic GGPP synthetase, which are involved in
   the biosynthesis of carotenoids (gene crtE). Such an enzyme is also encoded in the cyanelle
   genome of Cyanophora paradoxa. - Eukaryotic hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase, which is
   involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q and which catalyzes the formation of all trans-
   polyprenyl pyrophosphates generally ranging in length of between 6 and 10 isoprene units
   depending on the species. HP synthetase is a mitochondrial membrane-associated enzyme. It has
   been shown [1 to 5] that all the above enzymes share some regions of sequence similarity. Two of
   these regions are rich in aspartic-acid residues and could be involved in the catalytic mechanism
   and/or the binding of the substrates. signature patterns were developed for both regions.
   Possible additional members of this family of proteins are: - Bacillus subtilis spore germination
   protein C3 (gene gerC3). Both proteins are most probably also enzymes involved in isoprenoid
   metabolism [6]. Consensus pattern: [LIVM](2)-x-D-D-x(2,4)-D-x(4)-R-R-[GH]- Consensus pattern:

  <p> 462. Potato inhibitor I family signature </p>
  <p>[0791] The potato inhibitor I family is one of the numerous families of serine proteinase
   inhibitors. Members of this protein family are found in plants; in the seeds of barley or beans
   [1,2,3], and in potato or tomato leaves where they accumulate in response to mechanical damage
   [4,5]. An inhibitor belonging to this family is also found in leech [6]. It is interesting to
   note that, currently, this is the only proteinase inhibitor family to be found both inplant and
   animal kingdoms. Structurally these inhibitors are small (60 to 90 residues) and in contrast with
   other families of protease inhibitors, they lack disulfide bonds. They have a single inhibitory
   site. The consensus pattern includes three out of the four residues conserved in all members of
   this family and is located in the N-terminal half. Consensus pattern:
   [FYW]-P-[EQH]-[LIV](2)-G-x(2)-[STAGV]-x(2)-A- Barley subtilisin-chymotrypsin inhibitor-2b has Glu
   instead of Gly. There is a trypsin inhibitor from the cucurbitaceae Momordica charantia [7],
   which is said to belong to the potato inhibitor I family but which shows only a very weak
   similarity with the other members of this family. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Svendsen I., Hejgaard J., Chavan J.K.

  <p> 463. (pp binding) Phosphopantetheine attachment site </p>
  <p>[0792] Phosphopantetheine (or pantetheine 4' phosphate) is the prosthetic group of acyl carrier
   proteins (ACP) in some multienzyme complexes where it serves as a 'swinging arm' for the
   attachment of activated fatty acid and amino-acid groups [1]. Phosphopantetheine is attached to a
   serine residue in these proteins [2]. ACP proteins or domains have been found in various enzyme
   systems which are listed below (references are only provided for recently determined sequences).
   - Fatty acid synthetase (FAS), which catalyzes the formation of long-chain fatty acids from
   acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and NADPH. Bacterial and plant chloroplast FAS are composed of eight
   separate subunits which correspond to the different enzymatic activities; ACP is one of these
   polypeptides. Fungal FAS consists of two multifunctional proteins, FAS1 and FAS2; the ACP domain
   is located in the N-terminal section of FAS2. Vertebrate FAS consists of a single multifunctional
   enzyme; the ACP domain is located between the beta-ketoacyl reductase domain and the C-terminal
   thioesterase domain [3]. - Polyketide antibiotics synthase enzyme systems. Polyketides are
   secondary metabolites produced from simple fatty acids, by microorganisms and plants. ACP is one
   of the polypeptidic components involved in the biosynthesis of Streptomyces polyketide
   antibiotics actinorhodin, curamycin, granatacin, monensin, oxytetracycline and tetracenomycin C.
   - Bacillus subtilis putative polyketide synthases pksK, pksL and pksM which respectively contain
   three, five and one ACP domains. - The multifunctional 6-methysalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) from
   Penicillium patulum. This is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a
   polyketide antibiotic and which contains an ACP domain in the C-terminal extremity. -
   Multifunctional mycocerosic acid synthase (gene mas) from Mycobacterium bovis. - Gramicidin S
   synthetase I (gene grsA) from Bacillus brevis. This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the
   biosynthesis of the cyclic antibiotic gramicidin S. - Tyrocidine synthetase I (gene tycA) from
   Bacillus brevis. The reaction carried out by tycA is identical to that catalyzed by grsA -
   Gramicidin S synthetase II (gene grsB) from Bacillus brevis. This enzyme is a multifunctional
   protein that activates and polymerizes proline, valine, ornithine and leucine. GrsB contains four
   ACP domains. - Erythronolide synthase proteins 1, 2 and 3 from Saccharopolyspora erythraea which
   is involved in the biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic erythromicin. Each of these proteins
   contain two ACP domains. - Conidial green pigment synthase from Aspergillus nidulans. - ACV
   synthetase from various fungi. This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of
   penicillin and cephalosporin. It contains three ACP domains. - Enterobactin synthetase component
   F (gene entF) from Escherichia coli. This enzyme is involved in the ATP-dependent activation of
   serine during enterobactin (enterochelin) biosynthesis. - Cyclic peptide antibiotic surfactin
   synthase subunits 1, 2 and 3 from Bacillus subtilis. Subunits 1 and 2 contains three related
   domains while subunit 3 only contains a single domain. - HC-toxin synthetase (gene HTS1) from
   Cochliobolus carbonum. This enzyme synthesizes HC-toxin, a cyclic tetrapeptide. HTS1 contains
   four ACP domains. - Fungal mitochondrial ACP [9], which is part of the respiratory chain NADH
   dehydrogenase (complex I). - Rhizobium nodulation protein nodF, which probably acts as an ACP in
   the synthesis of the nodulation Nod factor fatty acyl chain.The sequence around the
   phosphopantetheine attachment site is conserved in all these proteins and can be used as a
   signature pattern. A profile was also developed that spans the complete ACP-like domain.

  <p>[0793] The following enzymes catalyze mechanistically related reactions which involvethe highly
   complex cyclic rearrangement of squalene or its 2,3 oxide: - Lanosterol synthase (EC 5.4.99.7)
   (oxidosqualene--lanosterol cyclase), which catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene to
   lanosterol, the initial precursor of cholesterol, steroid hormones and vitamin D in vertebrates
   and of ergosterol in fungi (gene ERG7). - Cycloartenol synthase (EC 5.4.99.8)
   (2,3-epoxysqualene--cycloartenol cyclase), a plant enzyme that catalyzes the cyclization of
   (S)-2,3- epoxysqualene to cycloartenol. - Hopene synthase (EC 5.4.99.-) (squalene--hopene
   cyclase), a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the cyclization of squalene into hopene, a key step
   in hopanoid (triterpenoid) metabolism.These enzymes are evolutionary related [1] proteins of
   about 70 to 85 Kd. As a signature pattern, a highly conserved region was selected which is rich

  <p>[0794] Prion protein (PrP) [1,2,3] is a small glycoprotein found in high quantity in the brains
   of humans or animals infected with a number of degenerative neurological diseases such as Kuru,
   Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), scrapie or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). PrP is
   encoded in the host genome and expressed both in normal and infected cells. It has a tendency to
   aggregate yielding polymers called rods. Structurally, PrP is a protein consisting of a signal
   peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain that contains tandem repeats of a short motif
   (PHGGGWGQin mammals, PHNPGY in chicken), itself followed by a highly conserved domain 11y comes a
   C-terminal hydrophobic domain post-translationally removed when PrP is attachedto the
   extracellular side of the cell membrane by a GPI-anchor. The structureof PrP is shown in the
   following schematic representation:

  <p> 466. Cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase signature and profile (pro
   isomerase) </p>
  <p>[0795] Cyclophilin [1] is the major high-affinity binding protein in vertebrates for the
   immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CSA). It exhibits a peptidyl- prolyl cis-trans isomerase
   activity (EC 5.2.1.8) (PPIase or rotamase). PPIase is an enzyme that accelerates protein folding
   by catalyzing the cis-transisomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides [2]. It
   is probable that CSA mediates some of its effects via an inhibitory action on PPIase. Cyclophilin
   is a cytosolic protein which belongs to a family [3,4,5]that also includes the following
   isozymes: - Cyclophilin B (or S-cyclophilin), a PPIase which is retained in an endoplasmic
   reticulum compartment. - Cyclophilin C, a cytoplasmic PPiase. - Mitochondrial matrix cyclophilin
   (cyp3). - A PPIase which seems specific for the folding of rhodopsin and is an integral membrane
   protein anchored by a C-terminal transmembrane region. This protein was first characterized in
   Drosophila (gene ninaA). - Bacterial periplasmic PPiase (gene ppiA). - Bacterial cytosolic PPiase
   (gene ppiB). - Natural-killer cell cyclophilin-related protein. This large protein (about 160 Kd)
   is a component of a putative tumor-recognition complex involved in the function of NK cells. It
   contains a cyclophilin-type PPiase domain. - Mammalian nucleoporin Nup358 [6], a nuclear pore
   complex protein of 358 Kd that contains a C-terminal cyclophilin-type PPiase domain. - Yeast
   hypothetical protein YJR032w. - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC21E11.05c. -
   Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein T27D1.1. The sequences of the different forms of
   cyclophilin-type PPIases are well conserved. As a signature pattern, a conserved region was
   selected in the central part of these enzymes. Consensus pattern:
   [FY]-x(2)-[STCNLV]-x-F-H-[RH]-[LIVMN]-[LIVM]-x(2)-F- [LIVM]-x-Q-[AG]-G- FKBP's, a family of
   proteins that bind the immunosuppressive drug FK506, are also PPIases, but their sequence is not
   at all related to that of cyclophilin. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Stamnes M.A., Rutherford S.L., Zuker C.S. Trends Cell

  <p> 467. Profilin signature </p>
  <p>[0796] Profilin [1,2] is a small eukaryotic protein that binds to monomeric actin(G-actin) in a
   1:1 ratio thus preventing the polymerization of actin into filaments (F-actin). It can also, in
   certain circumstance promotes actin polymerization. Profilin also binds to polyphosphoinositides
   such as PIP2.Overall sequence similarity among profilin from organisms which belong to different
   phyla (ranging from fungi to mammals) is low, but the N-terminal region is relatively well
   conserved. That region is thought to be involved inthe binding to actin. The signature pattern
   for profilin is based on conserved residues at the N-terminal extremity .A protein structurally
   similar to profilin is present in the genome of variola and vaccinia viruses (gene A42R).

  <p>[0797] Protamines are small, highly basic proteins, that substitute for histones in sperm
   chromatin during the haploid phase of spermatogenesis. They pack sperm DNA into a highly
   condensed, stable and inactive complex. There are two different types of mammalian protamine,
   called P1 and P2. P1 has been found in all species studied, while P2 is sometimes absent. There
   seems to be a single type of avian protamine whose sequence is closely related to that of
   mammalian P1 [1].As a signature for this family of proteins, a conserved region was selected at

  <p>[0799] The proteasome (or macropain) (EC 3.4.99.46) [1 to 5,E1] is an eukaryotic and
   archaebacterial multicatalytic proteinase complex that seems to be involved inan
   ATP/ubiquitin-dependent nonlysosomal proteolytic pathway. In eukaryotes the proteasome is
   composed of about 28 distinct subunits which form a highly ordered ring-shaped structure (20S
   ring) of about 700 Kd. Most proteasome subunits can be classified, on the basis on sequence
   similarities into two groups, A and B. Subunits that belong to the A-type group are proteins of
   from 210 to 290 amino acids that share a number of conserved sequence regions. Subunits that are
   known to belong to this family are listed below. - Vertebrate subunits C2 (nu), C3, C8, C9, iota
   and zeta. - Drosophila PROS-25, PROS-28.1, PROS-29 and PROS-35. - Yeast C1 (PRS1), C5 (PRS3),

   PSM30. - Thermoplasma acidophilum alpha-subunit. In this archaebacteria the proteasome is
   composed of only two different subunits.As a signature pattern for proteasome A-type subunits the
   best conserved region was selected, which is located in the N-terminal part of these proteins.

  <p> 471. (pyr redox) Pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases class-I active site </p>
  <p>[0801] The pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases are FAD flavoproteins which contains
   a pair of redox-active cysteines involved in the transfer of reducing equivalents from the FAD
   cofactor to the substrate. On the basis of sequence and structural similarities [1] these enzymes
   can be classified into two categories. The first category groups together the following enzymes
   [2 to 6]: - Glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) (GR). - Higher eukaryotes thioredoxin reductase
   (EC 1.6.4.5). - Trypanothione reductase (EC 1.6.4.8). - Lipoamide dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4), the
   E3 component of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes. - Mercuric reductase (EC 1.16.1.1).The
   sequence around the two cysteines involved in the redox-active disulfide bond is conserved and
   can be used as a signature pattern. Consensus pattern: G-G-x-C-[LIVA]-x(2)-G-C-[LIVM]-P [The two
   C's form the active site disulfide bond]. In positions 6 and 7 of the pattern all known sequences
   have Asn-(Val/ Ile) with the exception of GR from plant chloroplasts and from cyanobacteria which
   have Ile-Arg [7]. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Kurlyan J., Krishna T.S.R., Wong L., Guenther B., Pahler A., Williams C.H.

  <p>[0802] Three different enzymes - all pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases - seem to share regions
   of sequence similarity [1,2,3,4], especially in the vicinity of the lysine residue which serves
   as the attachment site for the pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP) group. These enzymes are: - Glutamate
   decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15) (GAD). Catalyzes the decarboxylation of glutamate into the
   neurotransmitter GABA (4-aminobutanoate). - Histidine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.22) (HDC).
   Catalyzes the decarboxylation of histidine to histamine. There are two completely unrelated types
   of HDC: those that use PLP as a cofactor (found in Gram-negative bacteria and mammals), and those
   that contain a covalently bound pyruvoyl residue (found in Gram-positive bacteria). -
   Aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28) (DDC), also known as L-dopa decarboxylase or
   tryptophan decarboxylase. DDC catalyzes the decarboxylation of tryptophan to tryptamine. It also
   acts on 5-hydroxy- tryptophan and dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa). - Tyrosine decarboxylase (EC
   4.1.1.25) (TyrDC) which converts tyrosine into tyramine, a precursor of isoquinoline alkaloids
   and various amides. These enzymes are collectively known as group II decarboxylases [3,4].

  <p> 473. Regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) signatures (RCC1) </p>
  <p>[0803] The regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) [1] is a eukaryotic protein which binds
   to chromatin and interacts with ran, a nuclear GTP-binding protein, to promote the loss of bound
   GDP and the uptake offresh GTP, thus acting as a guanine-nucleotide dissociation stimulator
   (GDS)[2]. The interaction of RCC1 with ran probably plays an important role in the regulation of
   gene expression. RCC1, known as PRP20 or SRM1 in yeast, piml in fission yeast and BJ1 in
   Drosophila, is a protein that contains seven tandem repeats of a domain of about 50 to 60 amino
   acids. As shown in the following schematic representation, the repeats make up the major part of
   the length of the protein. Outside the repeat region, there is just a small N-terminal domain of
   about 40 to 50 residues and, in the Drosophila protein only, a C-terminal domain of about 130
   residues. +----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------------+¦N-t.¦Rpt.

  <p> 474. RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase signature (RCT) </p>
  <p>[0804] RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase (EC 6.5.1.4) [1,2] catalyzes the conversion of
   3'-phosphate to a 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester at the end of RNA. The biological role of this
   enzyme is unknown but it is likely to function in some aspects of cellular RNA processing. The
   reaction catalyzed by the enzyme occurs in three steps: 1) adenylation of the enzyme by ATP; 2)
   the enzyme acts on RNA-3'terminal phosphate to produce RNA-3'terminal diphosphate adenylate; 3)
   Release of AMP and cyclisation by a non catalytic nucleophilic attack by the adjacent 2'hydroxyl
   on the phosphorus in the diester linkage. This enzyme, which has been characterized in human
   (where there seems to be at least three isozymes) and Escherichia coli (gene rtCA), seems to be
   taxonomically widespread. It is found in insects, plants, fungi (gene RTC1 inyeast) and in
   archeabacteria. RNA cyclase is a protein of from 36 to 42 Kd. The best conserved region, which is
   used as a signature pattern, is a glycine-rich stretch of residues located in the central part of
   the sequence and which is reminiscent of various ATP, GTPor AMP glycine-rich loops. In this
   context, the conserved Arg (His in the E.coli enzyme) could be the AMP-binding residue. Consensus

  <p> 476. Prokaryotic-type class I peptide chain release factors signature (RF-1) </p>
  <p>[0805] Peptide chain release factors (RFs) are required for the termination of protein
   biosynthesis [1]. At present two classes of RFs can be distinguished. Class I RFs bind to
   ribosomes that have encountered a stop codon at their decoding site and induce release of the
   nascent polypeptide. Class II RFs are GTP-binding proteins that interact with class I RFs and
   enhance class I RF activity. In prokaryotes there are two class I RFs that act in a codon
   specific manner[2]: RF-1 (gene prfA) mediates UAA and UAG-dependent termination while RF-2(gene
   prfB) mediates UAA and UGA-dependent termination. RF-1 and RF-2 are structurally and evolutionary
   related proteins which have been shown [3] to make up a family that also contains the following
   proteins: - Fungal MRF1, a mitochondrial RF (m-RF) which recognizes the UAA and UAG codons. -
   Escherichia coli RF-H, a protein of unknown function. - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein
   yaeJ and a close Pseudomonas putida homolog. A highly conserved region located in the central
   part of the 40 to 45 Kd RF-1/2 and m-RF and in the N-terminal of the 15 to 16Kd RF-H and yaeJ is
   used as a signature pattern. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 478. (RIP) Shiga/ricin ribosomal inactivating toxins active site signature. </p>
  <p>[0807] A number of bacterial and plant toxins act by inhibiting protein synthesis in eukaryotic
   cells. The toxins of the Shiga and ricin family inactivate 60S ribosomal subunits by an
   N-glycosidic cleavage which releases a specific adenine base from the sugar-phosphate backbone of
   28S rRNA [1,2,3]. The toxins which are known to function in this manner are: - Shiga toxin from
   Shigella dysenteriae [4]. This toxin is composed of one copy of an enzymatically active A subunit
   and five copies of a B subunit responsible for binding the toxin complex to specific receptors on
   the target cell surface. - Shiga-like toxins (SLT) are a group of Escherichia coli toxins very
   similar in their structure and properties to Shiga toxin. The sequence of two types of these
   toxins, SLT-1 [5] and SLT-2 [6], is known. - Ricin, a potent toxin from castor bean seeds. Ricin
   consists of two glycosylated chains linked by a disulfide bond. The A chain is enzymatically
   active. The B chain is a lectin with a binding preference for galactosides. Both chains are
   encoded by a single polypeptidic precursor. Ricin is classified as a type-II
   ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP); other members of this family are agglutinin, also from
   castor bean, and abrin from the seeds of the bean Abrus precatorius [7]. - Single chain
   ribosome-inactivating proteins (type-I RIP) from plants. Examples of such proteins are: barley
   protein synthesis inhibitors I and II, mongolian snake-gourd trichosanthin, sponge gourd luffin-A
   and -B, garden four-o'clock MAP, common pokeberry PAP-S and soapwort saporin-6 [7]. All these
   toxins are structurally related. A conserved glutamic residue has been implicated [8] in the
   catalytic mechanism; it is located near a conserved arginine which also plays a role in catalysis
   [9]. The signature that has been developed for these proteins includes these catalytic residues.

   involved in the interaction with the other subunits of the RNA polymerase. The carboxyl-terminal
   domain interacts with the DNA and activators. The amino acid sequence of the alpha subunit is
   conserved in prokaryotic and chloroplast RNA polymerases. There are three regions of particularly

   thiocyanate. In vertebrates, rhodanese is a mitochondrial enzyme of about 300 amino-acid residues
   involved in forming iron-sulfur complexes and cyanide detoxification. A cysteine residue takes
   part in the catalytic mechanism. Some bacterial proteins closely related to rhodanese are also
   thought to express a sulfotransferase activity. These are: - Azotobacter vinelandii rhdA. -
   Escherichia coli sseA [3]. - Saccharopolyspora erythraea cysA [4]. - Synechococcus strain PCC

   cyanobacteria plastoquinone-plastocyanin reductase (EC 1.10.99.1) (also known as the b6f complex)

   cluster, which is called the Rieske protein [1,2]. The Rieske protein contains approximately 190
   amino acid residues. The iron-sulfur cluster is complexed to the protein through cysteine and
   histidine residues. Two perfectly conserved regions in Rieske proteins contains all the
   residuesthat bind the iron-sulfur cluster. Both regions contain two cysteines and a histidine.

  <p>[0904] Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (EC 5.2.1.8) (PPIase or rotamase) is an enzyme that
   accelerates protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide
   bonds in oligopeptides [1]. Most characterized PPiases belong to two families, the
   cyclophilin-type (see &lt;PDOC00154&gt;) and the the FKBP-type (see &lt;PDOC00426&gt;). Recently
   a third family has been discovered [2,3]. So far, the only biochemically characterized member of
   this family is the Escherichia coli protein parvulin (gene ppiC), a small (92 residues)
   cytoplasmic enzyme that prefers amino acid residues with hydrophobic side chains like leucine and
   phenylalanine in the P1 position of the peptides substrates. PpiC is evolutionary related to a
   number of proteins that are also probably PPiases: Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae
   ppiD. PpiD is a PPIase which contains a periplasmic ppiC-like domain anchored to the inner
   membrane and which seems to be involved in the folding of outer membrane proteins. Escherichia

  <p> 571. (RrnaAD) Ribosomal RNA adenine dimethylases signature </p>
  <p>[0905] A number of enzymes responsible for the dimethylation of adenosines if ribosomal RNAs
   (EC 2.1.1.48) have been found [1,2] to be evolutionary related. These enzymes are: Bacterial 16S
   rRNA dimethylase (gene ksgA), which acts in the biogenesis of ribosomes by catalyzing the
   dimethylation of two adjacent adenosines in the loop of a conserved hairpin near the 3'-end of
   16S rRNA. Inactivation of ksgA leads to resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic kasugamycin.
   Yeast 18S rRNA dimethylase (gene DIM1), which is functionally similar to ksgA and that
   dimethylates twin adenosines in the 3'-end of 18S rRNA. Bacterial 'erm' methylases. These enzymes
   confer resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics - such as
   erythromycin - by dimethylating the adenine residue at position 2058 of 235 rRNA thus resulting
   in a reduced affinity between ribosomes and the MLS antibiotics. Caenorhabditis elegans
   hypothetical protein EO2H1.1. The best conserved regions in these enzymes is located in the
   N-terminal section and corresponds to a region that is probably involved in S-adenosyl methionine
   (SAM) binding. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 573. ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop) (ras) </p>
  <p>[0906] From sequence comparisons and crystallographic data analysis it has been shown
   [1,2,3,4,5,6] that an appreciable proportion of proteins that bind ATP or GTP share a number of
   more or less conserved sequence motifs. The best conserved of these motifs is a glycine-rich
   region, which typically forms a flexible loop between a beta-strand and an alpha-helix. This loop
   interacts with one of the phosphate groups of the nucleotide. This sequence motif is generally
   referred to as the 'A' consensus sequence [1] or the 'P-loop' [5]. There are numerous ATP- or
   GTP-binding proteins in which the P-loop is found. A number of protein families for which the
   relevance of the presence of such a motif has been noted are listed below: - ATP synthase alpha
   and beta subunits. - Myosin heavy chains. - Kinesin heavy chains and kinesin-like proteins. -
   Dynamins and dynamin-like proteins - Guanylate kinase - Thymidine kinase (-Thymidylate kinase. -
   Shikimate kinase. - Nitrogenase iron protein family (nifH/frxC) - ATP-binding proteins involved
   in 'active transport' (ABC transporters) [7] - DNA and RNA helicases [8,9,10]. - GTP-binding
   elongation factors (EF-Tu, EF-1alpha, EF-G, EF-2, etc.). - Ras family of GTP-binding proteins
   (Ras, Rho, Rab, Ral, Ypt1, SEC4, etc.). - Nuclear protein ran. - ADP-ribosylation factors family
   - Bacterial dnaA protein - Bacterial recA protein - Bacterial recF protein - Guanine
   nucleotide-binding proteins alpha subunits (Gi, Gs, Gt, G0, etc.). - DNA mismatch repair proteins
   mutS family - Bacterial type II secretion system protein E. Not all ATP- or GTP-binding proteins
   are picked-up by this motif. A number of proteins escape detection because the structure of their
   ATP-binding site is completely different from that of the P-loop. Examples of such proteins are
   the E1-E2 ATPases or the glycolytic kinases. In other ATP- or GTP-binding proteins the flexible
   loop exists in a slightly different form; this is the case for tubulins or protein kinases. A
   special mention must be reserved foradenylate kinase, in which there is a single deviation from
   the P-loop pattern: in the last position Gly is found instead of Ser or Thr. Consensus pattern:
   [AG]-x(4)-G-K-[ST] In addition to the proteins listed above, the 'A' motif is also found in a
   number of other proteins. Most of these proteins probably bind a nucleotide, but others are
   definitively not ATP- or GTP-binding (as for example chymotrypsin, or human ferritin light
   chain). [ 1] <ref type="npl">Walker J.E., Saraste M., Runswick M.J., Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1:945-951(1982)</ref>.[ 2] <ref type="npl">Moller

  <p> GTP-binding nuclear protein ran signature (ras) </p>
  <p>[0907] Ran (or TC4) is a small abundant nuclear protein that binds and hydrolyzes GTP and which
   has been implicated in a large number of processes including nucleocytoplasmic transport, RNA
   synthesis, processing and export and cell cycle checkpoint control [1,2]. Ran is generally
   included in the RAS 'superfamily' of small GTP-binding proteins [3], but it is only slightly
   related to the other RAS proteins. It also differs from RAS proteins in that it lacks cysteine
   residues at its C- terminal and is therefore not subject to prenylation. Instead ran has an
   acidic C-terminus. It is, however similar to RAS family members in requiring a specific guanine
   nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and a specific GTPase activating protein (GAP) as stimulators of
   overall GTPase activity. The region of the GTP-binding B motif which, in ran, is perfectly
   conserved has been selected as a signature pattern. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 574. recA signature </p>
  <p>[0908] The bacterial recA protein [1,2,3,E1] is essential for homologous recombination and
   recombinational repair of DNA damage. RecA has many activities: it filaments, it binds to single-
   and double-stranded DNA, itbinds and hydrolyzes ATP, it is also a recombinase and, finally, it
   interacts with lexA causing its activation and leading to its autocatalytic cleavage. RecA is a
   protein of about 350 amino-acid residues. Its sequence is very well conserved [3,4,5,E1] among
   eubacterial species. It is also found in the chloroplast of plants [6]. The best conserved
   region, a nonapeptide located in the middle of the sequence which is part of the monomer-monomer
   interface in a recA filament has been selected as a signature pattern,. Consensus pattern:

   cleave the 3'-5' internucleotide linkage of RNA via a nucleotide 2',3'-cyclic phosphate
   intermediates (EC 3.1.27.1). A number of other RNAses have been found to be evolutionary related
   to these fungal enzymes: - Self-incompatibility [2] in flowering plants is often controlled by a
   single gene (S-gene) that has several alleles. This gene prevents fertilization by self-pollen or
   by pollen bearing either of the two S- alleles expressed in the style. The self-incompatibility
   glycoprotein from several higher plants of the solanaceae family has been shown [2,3] to be a
   ribonuclease. - Phosphate-starvation induced RNAses LE and LX from tomato [4]. These two enzymes
   are probably involved in a phosphate-starvation rescue system. - Escherichia coli periplasmic

   (PABP) (4 times). ** Others ** - Drosophila sex determination protein Sex-lethal (Sxl) (twice). -
   Drosophila sex determination protein Transformer-2 (Tra-2) (once). - Drosophila 'elav' protein (3
   times), which is probably involved in the RNA metabolism of neurons. - Human paraneoplastic
   encephalomyelitis antigen HuD (3 times) [4], which is highly similar to elav and which may play a
   role in neuron-specific RNA processing. - Drosophila 'bicoid' protein (once) [5], a
   segment-polarity homeobox protein that may also bind to specific mRNAs. - La antigen (once), a
   protein which may play a role in the transcription of RNA polymerase III. - The 60 Kd Ro protein
   (once), a putative RNP complex protein. - A maize protein induced by abscisic acid in response to

   cytotoxic lymphocyte target cells. may be involved in apoptosis. - Yeast RNA15 protein, which
   plays a role in mRNA stability and/or poly-(A) tail length [9].Inside the putative RNA-binding
   domain there are two regions which are highly conserved. The first one is a hydrophobic segment
   of six residues (which is called the RNP-2 motif), the second one is an octapeptide motif (which

  <p> 582. (rvp) Eukaryotic and viral aspartyl proteases active site </p>
  <p>[0917] Aspartyl proteases, also known as acid proteases, (EC 3.4.23.-) are a widely distributed
   family of proteolytic enzymes [1,2,3] known to exist invertebrates, fungi, plants, retroviruses
   and some plant viruses. Aspartate proteases of eukaryotes are monomeric enzymes which consist of
   two domains. Each domain contains an active site centered on a catalytic aspartyl residue. The
   two domains most probably evolved from the duplication of an ancestral gene encoding a primordial
   domain. Currently known eukaryotic aspartyl proteases are: - Vertebrate gastric pepsins A and C
   (also known as gastricsin). - Vertebrate chymosin (rennin), involved in digestion and used for
   making cheese. - Vertebrate lysosomal cathepsins D (EC 3.4.23.5) and E (EC 3.4.23.34). -
   Mammalian renin (EC 3.4.23.15) whose function is to generate angiotensin I from angiotensinogen
   in the plasma. - Fungal proteases such as aspergillopepsin A (EC 3.4.23.18), candidapepsin (EC
   3.4.23.24), mucoropepsin (EC 3.4.23.23) (mucor rennin), endothiapepsin (EC 3.4.23.22),
   polyporopepsin (EC 3.4.23.29), and rhizopuspepsin (EC 3.4.23.21). - Yeast saccharopepsin (EC
   3.4.23.25) (proteinase A) (gene PEP4). PEP4 is implicated in posttranslational regulation of
   vacuolar hydrolases. - Yeast barrier pepsin (EC 3.4.23.35) (gene BAR1); a protease that cleaves
   alpha-factor and thus acts as an antagonist of the mating pheromone. - Fission yeast sxal which
   is involved in degrading or processing the mating pheromones. Most retroviruses and some plant
   viruses, such as badnaviruses, encode for anaspartyl protease which is an homodimer of a chain of
   about 95 to 125 amino acids. In most retroviruses, the protease is encoded as a segment of a
   polyprotein which is cleaved during the maturation process of the virus. It is generally part of
   the pol polyprotein and, more rarely, of the gagpolyprotein. Conservation of the sequence around
   the two aspartates of eukaryotic aspartyl proteases and around the single active site of the
   viral proteases allows us to develop a single signature pattern for both groups of protease.

  <p> 584. (S-AdoMet synt) S-adenosylmethionine synthetase signatures </p>
  <p>[0919] S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (EC 2.5.1.6) is the enzyme that catalyzes theformation
   of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) from methionine and ATP [1]. AdoMet is an important methyl donor
   for transmethylation and is also the propylamino donor in polyamine biosynthesis. In bacteria
   there is a single isoform of AdoMet synthetase (gene metK), there are two in budding yeast (genes
   SAM1 and SAM2) and in mammals while in plants there is generally a multigene family.The sequence
   of AdoMet synthetase is highly conserved throughout isozymes and species. Two signature patterns
   have been selected for this type of enzyme; the first is a hexapeptide which seems to be involved
   in ATP-binding; the second is an almost perfectly conserved glycine-rich nonapeptide. Consensus

  <p>[0921] Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase (EC 6.3.2.6) (SAICARsynthetase)
   catalyzes the seventh step in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway; the ATP-dependent
   conversion of 5'-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxylic acid and aspartic acid to SAICAR
   [1]. In bacteria (gene purC),fungi (gene ADE1) and plants, SAICAR synthetase is a monofunctional
   protein;in higher vertebrates it is the N-terminal domain of a bifunctional enzyme that also
   catalyze phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase (AIRC) activity. Two conserved regions in the
   central section of this enzyme have been selected as signature patterns for SAICAR synthetase.

  <p>[0922] A variety of extracellular proteins from eukaryotes have been found to be evolutionary
   related: - Rodent sperm-coating glycoprotein (SCP), also known as acidic epididymal glycoprotein
   (AEG). This protein is thought to be involved in sperm maturation [1]. It is a protein of about
   220 residues and probably contains eight disulfide bonds. - Mammalian testis-specific protein
   Tpx-1 [2]. Tpx-1 is highly related to SCP's. - Mammalian glioma pathogenesis-related protein
   (GliPR). - Lizard helothermine, a toxin that blocks ryanodine receptors. - Venom allergen 5 (Ag5)
   from vespid wasps and venom allergen 3 (Ag3) from fire ants. These proteins are potent allergens
   and are the main cause of allergic reactions to stings from insects of the hymenoptera family
   [3]. Ag5/3 are proteins of about 200 residues and contain four disulfide bonds. - Plant
   pathogenesis proteins of the PR-1 family [4]. These proteins are synthesized during pathogen
   infection or other stress-related responses. They are proteins of about 130 to 140 residues and
   probably contain three disulfide bonds. - Proteins Sc7 and Sc14 from the basidomycete fungus
   Schizophyllum commune. These extracellular proteins are loosely associated with fruit body hyphal

   Ancylostoma secreted protein from dog hookworm. - Yeast hypothetical proteins YJL078c, YJL079c
   and YKR013w.The exact function of these proteins is not yet known. Two conserved regions located

  <p> 589. Src homology 3 (SH3) domain profile </p>
  <p>[0924] The Src homology 3 (SH3) domain is a small protein domain of about 60 amino-acid
   residues first identified as a conserved sequence in the non-catalytic part of several
   cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (e.g. Src, Abl, Lck) [1].Since then, it has been found in a
   great variety of other intracellular or membrane-associated proteins [2,3,4,5].The SH3 domain has
   a characteristic fold which consists of five or six beta-strands arranged as two tightly packed
   anti-parallel beta sheets. The linker regions may contain short helices [6].The function of the
   SH3 domain is not well understood. The current opinion is that they mediate assembly of specific
   protein complexes via binding to proline-rich peptides [7]. In general SH3 domains are found as
   single copies in a given protein, but there is a significant number of protein with two SH3
   domains and a few with 3 or 4 copies. So far, SH3 domains have been identified in the following
   proteins: - Many vertebrate, invertebrate and retroviral cytoplasmic (non-receptor) protein
   tyrosine kinases. In particular in the Src, Abl, Bkt, Csk and ZAP70 families of kinases. -
   Mammalian phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-gamma-1 and -2.-Mammalian phosphatidyl
   inositol 3-kinase regulatory p85 subunit. - Mammalian Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP). -
   Adaptor proteins mediating binding of guanine nucleotide exchange factors to growth factor
   receptors: vertebrate GRB2, Caenorhabditis elegans sem-5 and Drosophila DRK. All of which have
   two SH3 domains. - Mammalian Vav oncoprotein, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor of the CDC24
   family. - Some guanine-nucleotide releasing factors of the CDC25 family: yeast CDC25, yeast
   SCD25, fission yeast ste6. - MAGUK proteins. These proteins consist of at least three types of
   domains: one or more copies of the DHR domain, a SH3 domain and a C-terminal guanylate kinase
   domain. Members of this family are: Drosophila lethal(1)discs large-1 tumor suppressor protein
   (gene Dlg1), mammalian tight junction protein ZO-1, vertebrate erythrocyte membrane protein p55,
   Caenorhabditis elegans protein lin-2, rat protein CASK and mammalian synaptic proteins
   SAP90/PSD-95, CHAPSYN-110/PSD-93, SAP97/DLG1 and SAP102. - Miscellanous proteins interacting with
   vertebrate receptor protein tyrosine kinases: mammalian cytoplasmic protein Nck (3 copies),
   oncoprotein Crk (2 copies). - Chicken Src substrate p80/85 protein (cortactin) and the similar
   human hemopoietic lineage cell specific protein Hs1. - Mammalian dihydrouridine-sensitive L-type
   calcium channel beta (regulatory) subunit including the related human myasthenic syndrome antigen
   B (MSYB). - Mammalian neutrophil cytosolic activators of NADPH oxidase: p47 INCF-1), p67 (NCF-2),
   and a potential homolog from Caenorhabditis elegans (B0303.7). NCF-1 and -2 have two copies of
   the SH3 domain, while B0303.7 has four. - Some myosin heavy chains from amoebae, slime molds and
   yeast (gene MYO3). - Vertebrate and Drosophila spectrin and fodrin alpha-chain. - Human
   amphiphysin. - Yeast actin-binding protein ABP1. - Yeast actin-binding protein SLA1 (3 copies). -
   Yeast protein BEM1 and the fission yeast homolog scd2 (or ral3) (2 copies). - Yeast BEM1-binding
   proteins BOI2 (BEB1) and BOB1 (BOI1). - Yeast fusion protein FUS1. - Yeast protein RSV167. -
   Yeast protein SSU81. - Yeast hypothetical proteins YAR014c (1 copy), YFR024c (1 copy), YHL002w (1
   copy), YHR016c (1 copy), YJL020C (1 copy), YHR114w (2 copies) and the fission yeast homolog
   SpAC12C2.05c. - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins F42H10.3. The profile developed to
   detect SH3 domains is based on a structural alignment consisting of 5 gap-free blocks and 4
   linker regions totaling 62 match positions. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Mayer B.J., Hamaguchi M., Hanafusa H. Nature

  <p> 597. (SQS PSY) Squalene and phytoene synthases signatures </p>
  <p>[0932] Two different polyisoprene synthases have been shown [1,2,3] to share a number of
   regions of sequence similarities: - Squalene synthase (EC 2.5.1.21) (farnesyl-diphosphate
   farnesyltransferase) (SQS), which catalyzes the conversion of two molecules of farnesyl
   diphosphate (FPP) into squalene. It is the first committed step in the cholesterol biosynthetic
   pathway. The reaction carried out by SQS is catalyzed in two separate steps: the first is a
   head-to-head condensation of the two molecules of FPP to form presqualene diphosphate; this
   intermediate is then rearranged in a NADP-dependent reduction, to form squalene. SQS is found in
   eukaryotes. In yeast it is encoded by the ERG9 gene, in mammals by the FDFT1 gene. SQS seems to
   be membrane-bound. - Phytoene synthase (EC 2.5.1.-) (PSY), which catalyzes the conversion of two
   molecules of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into phytoene. It is the second step in the
   biosynthesis of carotenoids from isopentenyl diphosphate. The reaction carried out by PSY is
   catalyzed in two separate steps: the first is a head-to-head condensation of the two molecules of
   GGPP to form prephytoene diphosphate; this intermediate is then rearranged to form phytoene. PSY
   is found in all organisms that synthesize carotenoids: plants and photosynthetic bacteria as well
   as some non-photosynthetic bacteria and fungi. In bacteria PSY is encoded by the gene crtB. In
   plants PSY is localized in the chloroplast. As it can be seen from the description above, both
   SQS and PSY share a number of functional similarities which are also reflected at the level of
   their primary structure. In particular three well conserved regions are shared bySQS and PSY;
   they could be involved in substrate binding and/or the catalytic mechanism. Signature patterns
   have been developed for the second and third conserved regions; they are localized in the central
   part of these enzymes. Consensus pattern: Y-[CSAM]-x(2)-[VSG]-A-[GSA]-[LIVAT]-[IV]-G-x(2)-[LMSC]-

  <p> 598. SRP54-type proteins GTP-binding domain signature </p>
  <p>[0933] The signal recognition particle (SRP) is an oligomeric complex that mediates targeting
   and insertion of the signal sequence of exported proteins into the membrane of the endoplasmic
   reticulum. SRP consists of a 7S RNA and six protein subunits. One of these subunits, the 54 Kd
   protein (SRP54), is a GTP-binding protein that interacts with the signal sequence when it emerges
   from the ribosome. The N-terminal 300 residues of SRP54 include the GTP-binding site (G-domain)
   and are evolutionary related to similar domains in other proteins which are listed below [1]. -
   Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis ffh protein (P48), a protein which seems to be the
   prokaryotic counterpart of SRP54. Ffh is associated with a 4.5S RNA in the prokaryotic SRP
   complex. - Signal recognition particle receptor alpha subunit (docking protein), an integral
   membrane GTP-binding protein which ensures, in conjunction with SRP, the correct targeting of
   nascent secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The G-domain is located at the
   C-terminal extremity of the protein. - Bacterial ftsY protein, a protein which is believed to
   play a similar role to that of the docking protein in eukaryotes. The G-domain is located at the
   C-terminal extremity of the protein. - The pilA protein from Neisseria gonorrhoeae which seems to
   be the homolog of ftsY. - A protein from the archaebacteria Sulfolobus solfataricus. This protein
   is also believed to be a docking protein. The G-domain is also at the C- terminus. - Bacterial
   flagellar biosynthesis protein flhF. The best conserved regions in those domains are the sequence
   motifs that are part of the GTP-binding site, but as those regions are not specific to these
   proteins, they were not used as a signature pattern. Instead, a conserved region located at the
   C-terminal end of the domain was selected. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 599. (STphosphatase) Serine/threonine specific protein phosphatases signature </p>
  <p>[0934] Serine/threonine specific protein phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.16) (PP) [1,2,3] are enzymes
   that catalyze the removal of a phosphate group attached to a serine or evolutionary related. -
   Protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is an enzyme of broad specificity. It is inhibited by two
   thermostable proteins, inhibitor-1 and -2. In mammals, there are two closely related isoforms of
   PP-1: PP-1alpha and PP-1beta, produced by alternative splicing of the same gene. In Emericella
   nidulans, PP-1 (gene bimG) plays an important role in mitosis control by reversing the action of
   the nimA kinase. In yeast, PP-1 (gene SIT4) is involved in dephosphorylating the large subunit of
   RNA polymerase II. - Protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) is also an enzyme of broad specificity. PP2A
   is a trimeric enzyme that consist of a core composed of a catalytic subunit associated with a 65
   Kd regulatory subunit and a third variable subunit. In mammals, there are two closely related
   isoforms of the catalytic subunit of PP2A: PP2A-alpha and PP2A-beta, encoded by separate genes. -
   Protein phosphatase-2B (PP2B or calcineurin), a calcium-dependent enzyme whose activity is
   stimulated by calmodulin. It is composed of two subunits: the catalytic A-subunit and the
   calcium-binding B-subunit. The specificity of PP2B is restricted.In addition to the
   above-mentioned enzymes, some additional serine/threoninespecific protein phosphatases have been
   characterized and are listed below. - Mammalian phosphatase-X (PP-X), and Drosophila
   phosphatase-V (PP-V) which are closely related but yet distinct from PP2A. - Yeast phosphatase
   PPH3, which is similar to PP2A, but with different enzymatic properties. - Drosophila
   phosphatase-Y (PP-Y), and yeast phosphatases Z1 and Z2 (genes PPZ1 and PPZ2) which are closely
   related but yet distinct from PP1. - Drosophila retinal degeneration protein C (gene rdgC), a
   calcium-binding phosphatase required to prevent light-induced retinal degeneration. - Phages
   Lambda and Phi-80 ORF-221 which have been shown to have phosphatase activity and are related to
   mammalian PP's. The best conserved regions in these proteins is a perfectly conserved
   pentapeptide that can be used as a signature pattern. Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-R-G-N-H-E- [ 1]

  <p>[0936] Serine and threonine dehydratases [1,2] are functionally and structurally related
   pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzymes: - L-serine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.13) and D-serine
   dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.14) catalyze the dehydratation of L-serine (respectively D-serine) into
   ammonia and pyruvate. - Threonine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.16) (TDH) catalyzes the dehydratation of
   threonine into alpha-ketobutarate and ammonia. In Escherichia coli and other microorganisms, two
   classes of TDH are known to exist. One is involved in the biosynthesis of isoleucine, the other
   in hydroxamino acid catabolism.Threonine synthase (EC 4.2.99.2) is also a pyridoxal-phosphate
   enzyme, it catalyzes the transformation of homoserine-phosphate into threonine. It has been shown
   [3] that threonine synthase is distantly related to the serine/threonine dehydratases. In all
   these enzymes, the pyridoxal-phosphate group is attached to a lysine residue. The sequence around
   this residue is sufficiently conserved to allow the derivation of a pattern specific to
   serine/threonine dehydratases and threonine synthases. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0937] Cysteine synthase/cystathionine beta-synthase P-phosphate attachment site Cysteine
   synthase (CSase) is the pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzyme responsible [1] for the formation of
   cysteine from O-acetyl-serine and hydrogen sulfide with the concomitant release of acetic acid.
   In bacteria suchas Escherichia coli, two forms of the enzyme are known (genes cysK and cysM).In
   plants there are also two forms, one located in the cytoplasm and the otherin
   chloroplasts.Cystathionine beta-synthase [2] catalyzes the first irreversiblestep in homocysteine
   transulfuration; the conjugation of homocysteine andserine forming cystathionine. Like Csase it
   is a pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzyme. The two types of enzymes are evolutionary related. The
   pyridoxal-phosphategroup of CSases has been shown to be attached to a lysine residue which is
   located in the N-terminal section of these enzymes; the sequence around this residue is highly
   conserved and can be used as a signature pattern to detect this class of enzymes. Consensus

  <p>[0939] Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is a membrane-bound complex of two main components: a
   membrane-extrinsic component composed of an FAD-binding flavoprotein and an iron-sulfur protein,
   and a hydrophobic component composed of a cytochrome B and a membrane anchor protein. The
   cytochrome b component is a mono heme transmembrane protein [1,2,3] belonging to a family that
   groups: - Cytochrome b-556 from bacterial SDH (gene sdhC). - Cytochrome b560 from the mammalian
   mitochondrial SDH complex. - Cytochrome b560 subunit encoded in the mitochondrial genome of some
   algae and in the plant Marchantia polymorpha. - Cytochrome b from yeast mitochondrial SDH complex
   (gene SDH3 or CYB3). - Protein cyt-1 from Caenorhabditis.These cytochromes are proteins of about
   130 residues that comprise threetransmembrane regions. There are two conserved histidines which
   may beinvolved in binding the heme group. Two signature patterns have been developed that include
   these histidine residues. Consensus pattern:

   secE and sec61-gamma are small proteins of about 60 to 90 amino acids that contain a single
   transmembrane region at their C-terminal extremity (Escherichia colisecE is an exception, in that
   it possess an extra N-terminal segment of 60residues that contains two additional transmembrane

  <p>[0942] Plant seed storage proteins, whose principal function appears to be the major nitrogen
   source for the developing plant, can be classified, on the basis of their structure, into
   different families. 11-S are non-glycosylated proteins which form hexameric structures [1,2].
   Each of the subunits in the hexamer is itself composed of an acidic and a basic chain derived
   from a single precursor and linked by a disulfide bond. This structure is shown in the following

   In bacteria and fungi, ASDis a protein of about 40 Kd (340 to 370 residues) whose sequence is not

   the catalytic activity [2].The region of conservation around the active site residue is too small

  <p> 611. Stathmin family signatures </p>
  <p>[0947] Stathmin [1] (from the Greek 'stathmos' which means relay), is an ubiquitous
   intracellular protein, present in a variety of phosphorylated forms and which serves as a relay
   for diverse second messenger pathways. Its expression and phosphorylation are regulated
   throughout development and in response to extracellular signals regulating cell proliferation,
   differentiation and function. Stathmin is a highly conserved protein of 149 amino acid residues.
   Structurally, it consists of an N-terminal domain of about 45 residues followed by a 78 residue
   alpha-helical domain consisting of a heptad repeat coiled coil structure and a C-terminal domain
   of 25 residues. Protein SCG10 is a neuron-specific, membrane-associated protein that accumulates
   in the growth cones of developing neurons. It is highly similar in its sequence to stathmin, but
   differs in that it contains an additional N-terminal hydrophobic segment of 32 residues which is
   probably responsible for its interaction with membranes. Xenopus protein XB3 is also evolutionary
   related to stathmin and also contains an additional N-terminal hydrophobic domain [2]. A
   conserved decapeptide which ends with the first three residues of the coiled coil domain and a
   second pattern that corresponds to part of the central region of the coiled coil have been
   selected as signatures for proteins of the stathmin family. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 616. Syndecans signature </p>
  <p>[0952] Syndecans [1,2] (from the greek syndein; to bind together) are a family of transmembrane
   heparan sulfate proteoglycans which are implicated in the binding of extracellular matrix
   components and growth factors. Syndecans bind a variety of molecules via their heparan sulfate
   chains and can act as receptors or as co-receptors. Structurally, these proteins consist of four
   separate domains: a) A signal sequence; b) An extracellular domain (ectodomain) of variable
   length and whose sequence is not evolutionary conserved in the various forms of syndecans. The
   ectodomain contains the sites of attachment of the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan side chains;
   c) A transmembrane region; d) A highly conserved cytoplasmic domain of about 30 to 35 residues
   which could interact with cytoskeletal proteins. The proteins known to belong to this family are:
   - Syndecan 1. - Syndecan 2 or fibroglycan. - Syndecan 3 or neuroglycan or N-syndecan. - Syndecan
   4 or amphiglycan or ryudocan. - Drosophila syndecan. - Caenorhabditis elegans probable syndecan
   (F57C7.3).The signature pattern that has been developed for syndecans starts with the last
   residue of the transmembrane region and includes the first 10 residues of the cytoplasmic domain.
   This region, which contains four basic residues, could act as a stop transfer site. Consensus

   morphogenesis. - Syntaxin 1A (also known as antigen HPC-1) and syntaxin 1B which are synaptic
   proteins which may be involved in docking of synaptic vesicles at presynaptic active zones. -
   Syntaxin 3. - Syntaxin 4, which is potentially involved in docking of synaptic vesicles at
   presynaptic active zones. - Syntaxin 5, which mediates endoplasmic reticulum to golgi transport.
   - Syntaxin 6, which is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking. - Syntaxin 7. - Yeast PEP12
   (or VPS6) which is required for the transport of proteases to the vacuole. - Yeast SED5 which is
   required for the fusion of transport vesicles with the Golgi complex. - Yeast SSO1 and SSO2 which
   are required for vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. - Yeast VAM3, which is required for
   vacuolar assembly. - Arabidopsis thaliana protein KNOLLE which may be involved in cytokinesis. -
   Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins F35C8.4, F48F7.2, F55A11.2 and T01B11.3.The above
   proteins share the following characteristics: a size ranging from30 Kd to 40 Kd; a C-terminal
   extremity which is highly hydrophobic and isprobably involved in anchoring the protein to the
   membrane; a central, well conserved region, which seems to be in a coiled-coil conformation. The
   pattern specific for this family is based on the most conserved region of the coiled coil domain.

  <p>[0956] The eubacterial secY protein [1] plays an important role in protein export. It interacts
   with the signal sequences of secretory proteins as well as with two other components of the
   protein translocation system: secA and secE. SecY is an integral plasma membrane protein of 419
   to 492 amino acid residues that apparently contains ten transmembrane segments. Such a structure
   probablyconfers to secY a 'translocator' function, providing a channel for periplasmic and
   outer-membrane precursor proteins.Homologs of secY are found in archaebacteria [2]. SecY is also
   encoded in the chloroplast genome of some algae [3] where it could be involved in a
   prokaryotic-like protein export system across the two membranes of the chloroplast endoplasmic
   reticulum (CER) which is present in chromophyte andcryptophyte algae. Two signature patterns have
   been developed for secY proteins. The first corresponds to the second transmembrane region, which
   is the most conserved section of these proteins. The second spans the C-terminal part of the
   fourth transmembrane region, a short intracellular loop, and the N-terminal part of the fifth
   transmembrane region. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 623. Serpins signature. </p>
  <p>[0959] Serpins (SERine Proteinase INhibitors) [1,2,3,4] are a group of structurally related
   proteins. They are high molecular weight (400 to 500 amino acids),extracellular, irreversible
   serine protease inhibitors with a well defined structural-functional characteristic: a reactive
   region that acts as a 'bait' for an appropriate serine protease. This region is found in the
   C-terminal part of these proteins. Proteins which are known to belong to the serpin family are
   listed below (references are only provided for recently determined sequences): - Alpha-1 protease
   inhibitor (alpha-1-antitrypsin, contrapsin). - Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin,- Antithrombin III. -
   Alpha-2-antiplasmin. - Heparin cofactor II. - Complement C1 inhibitor. - Plasminogen activator
   inhibitors 1 (PAI-1) and 2 (PAI-2). - Glia derived nexin (GDN) (Protease nexin I). - Protein C
   inhibitor. - Rat hepatocytes SPI-1, SPI-2 and SPI-3 inhibitors. - Human squamous cell carcinoma
   antigen (SCCA) which may act in the modulation of the host immune response against tumor cells. -
   A lepidopteran protease inhibitor. - Leukocyte elastase inhibitor which, in contrast to other
   serpins, is an intracellular protein. - Neuroserpin [5], a neuronal inhibitor of plasminogen
   activators and plasmin. - Cowpox virus crmA [6], an inhibitor of the thiol protease
   interleukin-1B converting enzyme (ICE). CrmA is the only serpin known to inhibit a non-serine
   proteinase. - Some orthopoxviruses probable protease inhibitors, which may be involved in the
   regulation of the blood clotting cascade and/or of the complement cascade in the mammalian host.
   On the basis of strong sequence similarities, a number of proteins with no known inhibitory
   activity are said to belong to this family: - Birds ovalbumin and the related genes X and Y
   proteins. - Angiotensinogen; the precursor of the angiotensin active peptide. - Barley protein Z;
   the major endosperm albumin. - Corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG). - Thyroxine-binding
   globulin (TBG). - Sheep uterine milk protein (UTMP) and pig uteroferrin-associated protein
   (UFAP). - Hsp47, an endoplasmic reticulum heat-shock protein that binds strongly to collagen and
   could act as a chaperone in the collagen biosynthetic pathway [7]. - Maspin, which seems to
   function as a tumor supressor [5]. - Pigment epithelium-derived factor precursor (PEDF), a
   protein with a strong neutrophic activity [8].-Ep45, an estrogen-regulated protein from Xenopus
   [9]. A signature pattern has been developed for this family of proteins, centered on a well
   conserved Pro-Phe sequence which is found ten to fifteen residues on the C-terminal side of the
   reactive bond Consensus pattern:

  <p> 624. Sigma-54 interaction domain signatures and profile </p>
  <p>[0960] Some bacterial regulatory proteins activate the expression of genes from promoters
   recognized by core RNA polymerase associated with the alternative sigma-54 factor. These have a
   conserved domain of about 230 residues involved in the ATP-dependent [1,2] interaction with
   sigma-54. This domain has been found in the proteins listed below: - acoR from Alcaligenes
   eutrophus, an activator of the acetoin catabolism operon acoXABC. - algB from Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa, an activator of alginate biosynthetic gene algD. - dctD from Rhizobium, an activator
   of dctA, the C4-dicarboxylate transport protein. - dhaR from Citrobacter freundii, a regulator of
   the dha operon for glycerol utilization. - fhlA from Escherichia coli, an activator of the
   formate dehydrogenase H and hydrogenase III structural genes. - flbD from Caulobacter crescentus,
   an activator of flagellar genes. - hoxA from Alcaligenes eutrophus, an activator of the
   hydrogenase operon. - hrpS from Pseudomonas syringae, an activator of hprD as well as other hrp
   loci involved in plant pathogenicity. - hupR1 from Rhodobacter capsulatus, an activator of the
   [NiFe] hydrogenase genes hupSL. - hydG from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, an
   activator of the hydrogenase activity. - levR from Bacillus subtilis, which regulates the
   expression of the levanase operon (levDEFG and sacC). - nifA (as well as anfA and vnfA) from
   various bacteria, an activator of the nif nitrogen-fixing operon. - ntrC, from various bacteria,
   an activator of nitrogen assimilatory genes such as that for glutamine synthetase (glnA) or of
   the nif operon. - pgtA from Salmonella typhimurium, the activator of the inducible phospho-
   glycerate transport system. - pilR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an activator of pilin gene
   transcription. - rocR from Bacillus subtilis, an activator of genes for arginine utilization -
   tyrR from Escherichia coli, involved in the transcriptional regulation of aromatic amino-acid
   biosynthesis and transport. - wtsA, from Erwinia stewartii, an activator of plant pathogenicity
   gene wtsB. - xylR from Pseudomonas putida, the activator of the tol plasmid xylene catabolism
   operon xylCAB and of xylS.- Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yfhA. - Escherichia coli
   hypothetical protein yhgB. About half of these proteins (algB, dcdT, flbD, hoxA, hupR1, hydG,
   ntrC, pgtA and pilR) belong to signal transduction two-component systems [3] and possess a domain
   that can be phosphorylated by a sensor-kinase protein in their N- terminal section. Almost all of
   these proteins possess a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain in their C-terminal section. The
   domain which interacts with the sigma-54 factor has an ATPase activity. This may be required to
   promote a conformational change necessary for theinteraction [4]. The domain contains an atypical
   ATP-binding motif A (P-loop) as well as a form of motif B. The two ATP-binding motifs are located
   in the N-terminal section of the domain; signature patterns have been developed for both motifs.
   Other regions of the domain are also conserved. One of them, located in the C-terminal section,
   has been selected as a third signature pattern. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 625. Sigma-70 factors family signatures </p>
  <p>[0961] Sigma factors [1] are bacterial transcription initiation factors that promote the
   attachment of the core RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites and arethen released. They
   alter the specificity of promoter recognition. Most bacteria express a multiplicity of sigma
   factors. Two of these factors, sigma-70 (gene rpoD), generally known as the major or primary
   sigma factor, and sigma-54 (gene rpoN or ntrA) direct the transcription of a wide variety of
   genes. The other sigma factors, known as alternative sigma factors, are required for the
   transcription of specific subsets of genes. With regard to sequence similarity, sigma factors can
   be grouped into two classes: the sigma-54 and sigma-70 families. The sigma-70 family includes, in
   addition to the primary sigma factor, a wide variety of sigma factors, some of which are listed
   below: - Bacillus sigma factors involved in the control of sporulation-specific genes: sigma-E
   (sigE or spoIIGB), sigma-F (sigF or spoIIAC), sigma-G (sigG or spoIIIG), sigma-H (sigH or spo0C)
   and sigma-K (sigK or spoIVCB/spoIIIC). - Escherichia coli and related bacteria sigma-32 (gene
   rpoH or htpR) involved in the expression of heat shock genes. - Escherichia coli and related
   bacteria sigma-27 (gene fliA) involved in the expression of the flagellin gene. - Escherichia
   coli sigma-S (gene rpoS or katF) which seems to be involved in the expression of genes required
   for protection against external stresses. - Myxococcus xanthus sigma-B (sigB) which is essential
   for the late-stage differentiation of that bacteria. Alignments of the sigma-70 family permit the
   identification of four regions of high conservation [2,3]. Each of these four regions can in turn
   be subdivided into a number of sub-regions. Signature patterns based on the two best-conserved
   sub-regions have been developed. The first pattern corresponds to sub-region 2.2;the exact
   function of this sub-region is not known although it could be involved in the binding of the
   sigma factor to the core RNA polymerase. The second pattern corresponds to sub-region 4.2 which
   seems to harbor a DNA-binding 'helix-turn-helix' motif involved in binding the conserved
   -35region of promoters recognized by the major sigma factors. The second pattern starts one
   residue before the N-terminal extremity of the HTH region and ends six residues after its
   C-terminal extremity. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 626. Signal carboxyl-terminal domain. 430 members. </p>
  <p> 627. Signal peptidases I signatures </p>
  <p>[0962] Signal peptidases (SPases) [1] (also known as leader peptidases) remove the signal
   peptides from secretory proteins. In prokaryotes three types of Spases are known: type I (gene
   lepB) which is responsible for the processing of the majority of exported pre-proteins; type II
   (gene Isp) which only process lipoproteins, and a third type involved in the processing of pili
   subunits. SPase I is an integral membrane protein that is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by
   one (in B. subtilis) or two (in E. coli) N-terminal transmembrane domains with the main part of
   the protein protuding in the periplasmic space. Two residues have been shown [2,3] to be
   essential for the catalytic activity of SPase I: a serine and an lysine.SPase I is evolutionary
   related to the yeast mitochondrial inner membrane protease subunit 1 and 2 (genes IMP1 and IMP2)
   which catalyze the removal of signal peptides required for the targeting of proteins from the
   mitochondrial matrix, across the inner membrane, into the inter-membrane space [4]. In eukaryotes
   the removal of signal peptides is effected by an oligomeric enzymatic complex composed of at
   least five subunits: the signal peptidase complex (SPC). The SPC is located in the endoplasmic
   reticulum membrane. Two components of mammalian SPC, the 18 Kd (SPC18) and the 21 Kd (SPC21)
   subunits as well as the yeast SEC11 subunit have been shown [5] to share regions of sequence
   similarity with prokaryotic SPases I and yeast IMP1/IMP2. Three signature patterns for these
   proteins have been developed. The first signature contains the putative active site serine, the
   second signature contains the putative active site lysine which is not conserved in the SPC
   subunits, and the third signature corresponds to a conserved region of unknown iological
   significance which is located in the C-terminal section of all these proteins. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0963] Copper/Zinc superoxide dismutase (SODC) [1] is one of the three forms of an enzyme that

   Various forms of SODC are known: acytoplasmic form in eukaryotes, an additional chloroplast form
   in plants, an extracellular form in some eukaryotes, and a periplasmic form in prokaryotes. The
   metal binding sites are conserved in all the known SODC sequences [2]. Two signature patterns
   have been derived for this family of enzymes: the first one contains two histidine residues that

   cysteine which is involved in a disulfide bond. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 632. Sugar transport proteins signatures </p>
  <p>[0967] In mammalian cells the uptake of glucose is mediated by a family of closely related
   transport proteins which are called the glucose transporters [1,2,3].At least seven of these
   transporters are currently known to exist (in Human they are encoded by the GLUT1 to GLUT7
   genes).These integral membrane proteins are predicted to comprise twelve membrane spanning
   domains. The glucose transporters show sequence similarities [4,5] with a number of other sugar
   or metabolite transport proteins listed below (references are only provided for recently
   determined sequences). - Escherichia coli arabinose-proton symport (araE). - Escherichia coli
   galactose-proton symport (galP). - Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae citrate-proton
   symport (also known as citrate utilization determinant) (gene cit). - Escherichia coli
   alpha-ketoglutarate permease (gene kgtP). - Escherichia coli proline/betaine transporter (gene
   proP) [6]. - Escherichia coli xylose-proton symport (xylE). - Zymomonas mobilis glucose
   facilitated diffusion protein (gene glf). - Yeast high and low affinity glucose transport
   proteins (genes SNF3, HXT1 to HXT14). - Yeast galactose transporter (gene GAL2). - Yeast maltose
   permeases (genes MAL3T and MAL6T). - Yeast myo-inositol transporters (genes ITR1 and ITR2). -
   Yeast carboxylic acid transporter protein homolog JEN1. - Yeast inorganic phosphate transporter
   (gene PHO84). - Kluyveromyces lactis lactose permease (gene LAC12). - Neurospora crassa quinate
   transporter (gene Qa-y), and Emericella nidulans quinate permease (gene qutD). - Chlorella hexose
   carrier (gene HUP1). - Arabidopsis thaliana glucose transporter (gene STP1). - Spinach sucrose

   yabE, ydjE and yhjE. - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical proteins HI0281 and HI0418. - Bacillus
   subtilis hypothetical proteins yxbC and yxdF. It has been suggested [4] that these transport
   proteins have evolved from theduplication of an ancestral protein with six transmembrane regions,
   this hypothesis is based on the conservation of two G-R-[KR] motifs. The first one is located
   between the second and third transmembrane domains and the second one between transmembrane
   domains 8 and 9. Two patterns have been developed to detect this family of proteins. The first
   pattern is based on the G-R-[KR] motif; but because this motif is too short to be specific to
   this family of proteins, a pattern from a larger region centered on the second copy of this motif
   was derived. The second pattern is based on a number of conserved residues which are located at
   the end of the fourth transmembrane segment and in the short loop region between the fourth and
   fifth segments. Consensus pattern: [LIVMSTAG]-[LIVMFSAG]-x(2)-[LIVMSA]-[DE]-x-[LIVMFYWA]-G-

  <p> 633. Synaptobrevin signature </p>
  <p>[0968] Synaptobrevin [1] is an intrinsic membrane protein of small synaptic vesicles whose
   function is not yet known, but which is highly conserved in mammals, electric ray (where its is
   known as VAMP-1), Drosophila and yeast [2]. In yeast there are two closely related forms of
   synaptobrevin (genes SNC1 and SNC2) while in mammals there is at least 4 (genes SYB1, SYB2, SYB3
   and SYBL1). Structurally synaptobrevin consist of a N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of from 90 to
   110 residues, followed by a transmembrane region, and then by a short (from 2 to 22 residues)
   C-terminal intravesicular domain. As a signature pattern for synaptobrevin, a highly conserved
   stretch of residues located in the central part of the sequence was selected. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 635. Transcription factor TFIID repeat signature (TBP) </p>
  <p>[0970] Transcription factor TFIID (or TATA-binding protein, TBP) [1,2] is a general factor that
   plays a major role in the activation of eukaryotic genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. TFIID
   binds specifically to the TATA box promoter element which lies close to the position of
   transcription initiation. There is a remarkable degree of sequence conservation of a C-terminal
   domain of about 180 residues in TFIID from various eukaryotic sources. This region isnecessary
   and sufficient for TATA box binding. The most significant structural feature of this domain is
   the presence of two conserved repeats of a 77 amino-acid region. The intramolecular symmetry
   generates a saddle-shaped structure that sits astride the DNA [3]. Drosophila TRF (TBP-related
   factor) [4] is a sequence-specific transcription factor that also binds to the TATA box and is
   highly similar to TFIID. Archaebacteria also possess a TBP homolog [5]. A signature pattern that
   spans the last 50 residues of the repeated region has been derived.- Consensus pattern:

  <p> 637. TFIIS zinc ribbon domain signature </p>
  <p>[0972] Transcription factor S-II (TFIIS) [1] is a eukaryotic protein necessary for efficient
   RNA polymerase II transcription elongation, past template-encoded pause sites. TFIIS shows
   DNA-binding activity only in the presence of RNA polymerase II. It is a protein of about 300
   amino acids whose sequence is highly conserved in mammals, Drosophila, yeast (where it was first
   known as PPR2, a transcriptional regulator of URA4, and then as DST1, the DNA strand transfer
   protein alpha [2]) and in the archaebacteria Sulfolobus acidocaldarius [3].This family also
   includes the eukaryotic and archebacterial RNA polymerase subunits of the 15 Kd / M family (see
   &lt;PDOC00790&gt;) as well as the following viral proteins: - Vaccinia virus RNA polymerase 30 Kd
   subunit (rpo30) [4]. - African swine fever virus protein I243L [5].The best conserved region of
   all these proteins contains four cysteines that bind a zinc ion and fold in a conformation termed
   a 'zinc ribbon' [6]. Besides these cysteines, there are a number of other conserved residues
   which can be used to help define a specific pattern for this type of domain. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 638. Tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase signatures (THF DHG CYH) </p>
  <p>[0973] Enzymes that participate in the transfer of one-carbon units are involved in various
   biosynthetic pathways. In many of these processes the transfers of one-carbon units are mediated
   by the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate (THF). Various reactions generate one-carbon derivatives of THF
   which can be interconverted between different oxidation states by formyltetrahydrofolate
   synthetase(EC 6.3.4.3), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.5 or EC 1.5.1.15) and
   methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.9).The dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase
   activities are expressed by a variety of multifunctional enzymes: - Eukaryotic
   C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase (C1-THF synthase), which catalyzes all three reactions described
   above. Two forms of C1-THF synthases are known [1], one is located in the mitochondrial matrix,
   while the second one is cytoplasmic. In both forms the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain is
   located in the N-terminal section of the 900 amino acids protein and consists of about 300 amino
   acid residues. The C1-THF synthases are NADP- dependent. - Eukaryotic mitochondrial bifunctional
   dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase [2]. This is an homodimeric NAD-dependent enzyme of about 300 amino
   acid residues. - Bacterial folD [3]. FolD is an homodimeric bifunctional NADP-dependent enzyme of
   about 290 amino acid residues. The sequence of the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain is highly
   conserved in all forms of the enzyme. Two conserved regions have been selected as signature
   patterns. The first one is located in the N-terminal part of these enzymes and contains three
   acidic residues. The second pattern is a highly conserved sequence of 9 amino acids which is
   located in the C-terminal section. Consensus pattern:

   the reversible interconversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. TIM
   plays an important role in several metabolic pathways and is essential for efficient energy
   production. It is a dimer of identical subunits, each of which is made up of about 250 amino-acid
   residues. A glutamic acid residue is involved in the catalytic mechanism [2]. The sequence around
   the active site residue is perfectly conserved in all known TIM's and can be used as a signature

   as cellular thymidylate kinases, while the second family currently consists of TK from the
   following sources: - Vertebrates. - Bacterial. - Bacteriophage T4. - Pox viruses. - African swine

  <p> 642. Nuclear transition protein 2 signatures (TP2) </p>
  <p>[0977] In mammals, the second stage of spermatogenesis is characterized by the conversion of
   nucleosomal chromatin to the compact, non-nucleosomal and transcriptionally inactive form found
   in the sperm nucleus. This condensation is associated with a double-protein transition. The first
   transition corresponds to the replacement of histones by several spermatid-specific proteins,
   also called transition proteins, which are themselves replaced by protamines during the second
   transition. Nuclear transition protein 2 (TP2) is one of those spermatid-specific proteins. TP2
   is a basic, zinc-binding protein [1] of 116 to 137 amino-acid residues. Structurally, TP2
   consists of three distinct parts: a conserved serine-rich N-terminal domain of about 25 residues,
   a variable central domain of 20 to 50 residues which contains cysteine residues, and a conserved
   C-terminal domain of about 70 residues rich in lysines and arginines. Two signature patterns for
   TP2 have been developed: one located in the N-terminal domain, the other in the C-terminal.

  <p> 645. Uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase signatures (TP methylase) </p>
  <p>[0980] Uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.107) (SUMT) [1,2] catalyzes the transfer
   of two methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the C-2 and C-7atoms of uroporphyrinogen III
   to yield precorrin-2 via the intermediate formation of precorrin-1. SUMT is the first enzyme
   specific to the cobalamin pathway and precorrin-2 is a common intermediate in the biosynthesis of
   corrinoids such as vitamin B 12, siroheme and coenzyme F430.The sequences of SUMT from a variety
   of eubacterial and archaebacterial species are currently available. In species such as Bacillus
   megaterium (gene cobA), Pseudomonas denitrificans (cobA) or Methanobacterium ivanovii (gene corA)
   SUMT is a protein of about 25 to 30 Kd. In Escherichia coli and related bacteria, the cysG
   protein, which is involved in the biosynthesis of siroheme, is a multifunctional protein composed
   of a N-terminal domain, probably involved in transforming precorrin-2 into siroheme, and a
   C-terminal domain which has SUMT activity. The sequence of SUMT is related to that of a number of
   P. denitrificans and Salmonella typhimurium enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of cobalamin
   which also seem to be SAM-dependent methyltransferases [3,4]. The similarity is especially strong
   with two of these enzymes: cobI/cbiL which encodes S-adenosyl-L-methionine--precorrin-2
   methyltransferase and cobM/cbiF whose exact function is not known. Two signature patterns have
   been developed for these enzymes. The first corresponds to a well conserved region in the
   N-terminal extremity (called region 1 in [1,3]) and the second to a less conserved region located
   in the central part of these proteins (this pattern spans what are called regions 2 and 3 in

   to a family which currently consists of the following members: - Mammalian tub, an hydrophilic
   protein of about 500 residues, which could be involved in the hypothalamic regulation of body
   weight. - Human protein TULP1 [3] which may be involved in retinis pigmentosa 14, a retinal
   degeneration disease. - Mouse protein p4-6 whose function is not known. - Caenorhabditis elegans
   hypothetical protein F10B5.4. - Several fragmentary sequences from plants, Drosophila and human
   ESTs. While the N-terminal part of these protein is not conserved in length nor in the sequence,
   the C-terminal 250 residues are highly conserved. Therefore, two regions were selected in the
   C-terminal part as signature patterns. The secondr egion is located at the C-terminal extremity
   and contains a penultimate cysteine residue that could be critical to the normal functioning of
   these proteins. Consensus pattern: F-[KHQ]-G-R-V-[ST]-x-A-S-V-K-N-F-Q Consensus pattern:

   the transient breakage of DNA, one strand at a time, and the subsequent rejoining of the strands.
   When a eukaryotic type 1 topoisomerase breaks a DNA backbone bond, it simultaneously forms a
   protein-DNA link where the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue is joined to a 3'-phosphate on
   DNA, at one end of the enzyme-severed DNA strand. In eukaryotes and pox virus topoisomerases I,
   there are a number of conserved residues in the region around the active site tyrosine. Consensus
   pattern: [DEN]-x(6)-[GS]-[IT]-S-K-x(2)-Y-[LIVM]-x(3)-[LIVM] [Y is the active site tyrosine] [ 1]

  <p> 652. Transaldolase signatures </p>
  <p>[0987] Transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2) catalyzes the reversible transfer of a three-carbonketol unit
   from sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form erythrose 4-phosphate and
   fructose 6-phosphate. This enzyme, together with transketolase, provides a link between the
   glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathways. Transaldolase is an enzyme of about 34 Kd whose
   sequence has been well conserved throughout evolution. A lysine has been implicated [1]in the
   catalytic mechanism of the enzyme; it acts as a nucleophilic group that attacks the carbonyl
   group of fructose-6-phosphate.Transaldolase is evolutionary related [2] to a bacterial protein of
   about 20Kd (known as talC in Escherichia coli), whose exact function is not yet known. Two
   signature patterns have been developed for these proteins. The first, located in the N-terminal
   section, contains a perfectly conserved pentapeptide; these cond, includes the active site
   lysine. Consensus pattern: [DG]-[IVSA]-T-[ST]-N-P-[STA]-[LIVMF](2) Consensus pattern:

  <p>[0989] Trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28) is the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the

   wide variety of organisms and whose sequence has been highly conserved throughout evolution. Two
   of the most highly conserved regions have been selected as signature patterns. The first pattern
   is located in the central section, the second one is in the C-terminal region. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 656. Tropomyosins signature </p>
  <p>[0991] Tropomyosins [1,2] are family of closely related proteins present in muscle and
   non-muscle cells. In striated muscle, tropomyosin mediate the interactions between the troponin
   complex and actin so as to regulate muscle contraction. The role of tropomyosin in smooth muscle
   and non-muscle tissues is not clear. Tropomyosin is an alpha-helical protein that forms a
   coiled-coil dimer. Muscle isoforms of tropomyosin are characterized by having 284 amino acid
   residues and a highly conserved N-terminal region, whereas non-muscle forms are generally smaller
   and are heterogeneous in their N-terminal region. The signature pattern for tropomyosins is based
   on a very conserved region in the C-terminal section of tropomyosins and which is present in both
   muscle and non-muscle forms. Consensus pattern: L-K-E-A-E-x-R-A-E [ 1] <ref type="npl">Smilie L.B. Trends

  <p> 657. Troponin </p>
  <p>[0992] Troponin (Tn) contains three subunits, Ca2+ binding (TnC), inhibitory (TnI), and
   tropomyosin binding (TnT). this Pfam contains members of the TnT subunit. Troponin is a complex
   of three proteins, Ca2+ binding (TnC), inhibitory (TnI), and tropomyosin binding (TnT). The
   troponin complex regulates Ca++ induced muscle contraction. This family includes troponin T and
   troponin I. Troponin I binds to actin and troponin T binds to tropomyosin. Number of members: 81

   central region is not well conserved and contains a large number of threonine residues which can
   be glycosylated [1]. Indirect evidence suggested that these genes might encode the core protein
   of parasite mucins, glycoproteins that were proposed to be involved in the interaction with, and
   invasion of, mammalian host cells. [1] <ref type="npl">Di Noia JM, Sanchez DO, Frasch AC; J Biol Chem

  <p> 659. Aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases class-I signature (tRNA synt 1) </p>
  <p>[0994] Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (EC 6.1.1.-) [1] are a group of enzymes which activate amino
   acids and transfer them to specific tRNA molecules as the first step in protein biosynthesis. In
   prokaryotic organisms there are at least twenty different types of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases,
   one for each differentamino acid. In eukaryotes there are generally two aminoacyl-tRNA
   synthetases for each different amino acid: one cytosolic form and a mitochondrial form. While all
   these enzymes have a common function, they are widely diverse interms of subunit size and of
   quaternary structure. A few years ago it was found [2] that several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
   share a region of similarity in their N-terminal section, in particular the consensus
   tetrapeptide His-Ile-Gly-His ('HIGH') is very well conserved. The 'HIGH' region has been shown
   [3] to be part of the adenylate binding site. The 'HIGH' signature has been found in the
   aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases specific for arginine, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, isoleucine,
   leucine, methionine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and valine. These aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are
   referred to as class-I synthetases [4,5,6] and seem to share the same tertiarystructure based on
   a Rossmann fold. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[1001] Thaumatin [1] is an intensively sweet-tasting protein (100 000 times sweeter than
   sucrose on a molar basis) from Thaumatococcus daniellii, an African brush. The protein is made of
   about 200 residues and contains 8 disulfide bonds. A number of proteins have been found to be
   related to thaumatins. These protein are listed below (references are only provided for recently

   viruses. - Salt-induced protein NP24 from tomato. - Osmotin, a salt-induced protein from tobacco.
   - Osmotin-like proteins OSML13, OSML15 and OSML81 from potato [2]. - P21, a leaf protein from
   soybean. - PWIR2, a leaf protein from wheat. - Zeamatin, a maize antifunal protein [3].The exact
   biological function of all these proteins is not yet known. A conserved region that includes
   three cysteine residues known (in thaumatin) to be involved in disulfide bonds has been selected
   as a signature pattern.

  <p> 667. Thiolases signatures </p>
  <p>[1002] Two different types of thiolase [1,2,3] are found both in eukaryotes and in prokaryotes:
   acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase(EC 2.3.1.16). 3-ketoacyl-CoA
   thiolase (also called thiolase I) has a broad chain-length specificity for its substrates and is
   involved in degradative pathways such as fatty acid beta-oxidation. Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase
   (also called thiolase II) is specific for the thiolysis of acetoacetyl-CoA and involved in
   biosynthetic pathways such as poly beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesisor steroid biogenesis. In
   eukaryotes, there are two forms of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase: one located in the mitochondrion and
   the other in peroxisomes. There are two conserved cysteine residues important for thiolase
   activity. The first located in the N-terminal section of the enzymes is involved in the formation
   of an acyl-enzyme intermediate; the second located at the C-terminal extremity is the active site
   base involved in deprotonation in the condensation reaction. Mammalian nonspecific lipid-transfer
   protein (nsL-TP) (also known as sterol carrier protein 2) is a protein which seems to exist in
   two different forms: a 14 Kd protein (SCP-2) and a larger 58 Kd protein (SCP-x). The former is
   found in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria and is involved in lipid transport; the latter is
   found in peroxisomes. The C-terminal part of SCP-x is identical to SCP-2 while the N-terminal
   portion is evolutionary related to thiolases[4]. Three signature patterns have been developed for
   this family of proteins, two of which are based on the regions around the biologically important
   cysteines. The third is based on a highly conserved region in the C-terminal part of these
   proteins. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 668. Thioredoxin family active site </p>
  <p>[1003] Thioredoxins [1 to 4] are small proteins of approximately one hundred amino-acid
   residues which participate in various redox reactions via the reversible oxidation of an active
   center disulfide bond. They exist in either a reduced form or an oxidized form where the two
   cysteine residues are linked in an intramolecular disulfide bond. Thioredoxin is present in
   prokaryotes and eukaryotes and the sequence around the redox-active disulfide bond is
   wellconserved. Bacteriophage T4 also encodes for a thioredoxin but its primary structure is not
   homologous to bacterial, plant and vertebrate thioredoxins. A number of eukaryotic proteins
   contain domains evolutionary related tothioredoxin, all of them seem to be protein disulphide
   isomerases (PDI). PDI(EC 5.3.4.1) [5,6,7] is an endoplasmic reticulum enzyme that catalyzes the
   rearrangement of disulfide bonds in various proteins. The various forms of PDI which are
   currently known are: - PDI major isozyme; a multifunctional protein that also function as the
   beta subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2), as a component of oligosaccharyl transferase
   (EC 2.4.1.119), as thyroxine deiodinase (EC 3.8. 1.4), as glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase
   (EC 1.8.4.2) and as a thyroid hormone-binding protein ! - ERp60 (ER-60; 58 Kd microsomal
   protein). ERp60 was originally thought to be a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C isozyme
   and later to be a protease. - ERp72. - P5.All PDI contains two or three (ERp72) copies of the
   thioredoxin domain. Bacterial proteins that act as thiol:disulfide interchange proteins
   thatallows disulfide bond formation in some periplasmic proteins also contain a thioredoxin
   domain. These proteins are: - Escherichia coli dsbA (or prfA) and its orthologs in Vibrio
   cholerae (tcpG) and Haemophilus influenzae (por). - Escherichia coli dsbC (or xpRA) and its
   orthologs in Erwinia chrysanthemi and Haemophilus influenzae. - Escherichia coli dsbD (or dipZ)
   and its Haemophilus influenzae ortholog. - Escherichia coli dsbE (or ccmG) and orthologs in
   Haemophilus influenzae, Rhodobacter capsulatus (helX), Rhiziobiacae (cycY and tlpA). Consensus

  <p> 669. (Transcript fac2) Transcription factor TFIIB repeat signature </p>
  <p>[1004] In eukaryotes the initiation of transcription of protein encoding genes by polymerase II
   is modulated by general and specific transcription factors. The general transcription factors
   operate through common promoters elements (such as the TATA box). At least seven different
   proteins associates to form the general transcription factors: TFIIA, -IIB, -IID, -IIE, -IIF,
   -IIG, and -IIH[1].Transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) plays a central role in the transcription of
   class II genes, it associates with a complex of TFIID-IIA bound to DNA (DA complex) to form a
   ternary complex TFIID-IIA-IBB (DAB complex) which is then recognized by RNA polymerase II [2,3].
   TFIIB is a protein of about 315 to 340amino acid residues which contains, in its C-terminal part
   an imperfect repeat of a domain of about 75 residues. This repeat could contribute an element of
   symmetry to the folded protein. The following proteins have been shown to be evolutionary related
   to TFIIB: - An archaebacterial TFIIB homolog. In Pyrococcus woesei a previously undetected open
   reading frame has been shown [4] to be highly related to TFIIB. - Fungal transcription factor
   IIIB 70 Kd subunit (gene PCF4/TDS4/BRF1) [5]. This protein is a general activator of RNA
   polymerase III transcription and plays a role analogous to that of TFIIB in pol III
   transcription. The central section of the repeated domain, which is the most conserved part of
   that domain has been selected as a signature pattern. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 670. (transcritp fact) MADS-box domain signature and profile </p>
  <p>[1005] A number of transcription factors contain a conserved domain of 56 amino-acid residues,
   sometimes known as the MADS-box domain [E1]. They are listed below: - Serum response factor (SRF)
   [1], a mammalian transcription factor that binds to the Serum Response Element (SRE). This is a
   short sequence of dyad symmetry located 300 bp to the 5' end of the transcription initiation site
   of genes such as c-fos. - Mammalian myocyte-specific enhancer factors 2A to 2D (MEF2A to MEF2D).
   These proteins are transcription factor which binds specifically to the MEF2 element present in
   the regulatory regions of many muscle-specific genes. - Drosophila myocyte-specific enhancer
   factor 2 (MEF2). - Yeast GRM/PRTF protein (gene MCM1) [2], a transcriptional regulator of
   mating-type-specific genes. - Yeast arginine metabolism regulation protein I (gene ARGR1 or
   ARG80). - Yeast transcription factor RLM1. - Yeast transcription factor SMP1. - Arabidopsis
   thaliana agamous protein (AG) [3], a probable transcription factor involved in regulating genes
   that determines stamen and carpel development in wild-type flowers. Mutations in the AG gene
   result in the replacement of the stamens by petals and the carpels by a new flower. - Arabidopsis
   thaliana homeotic proteins Apetala1 (AP1), Apetala3 (AP3) and Pistillata (PI) which act locally
   to specify the identity of the floral meristem and to determine sepal and petal development [4].
   - Antirrhinum majus and tobacco homeotic protein deficiens (DEFA) and globosa (GLO) [5]. Both
   proteins are transcription factors involved in the genetic control of flower development.
   Mutations in DEFA or GLO cause the transformation of petals into sepals and of stamina into
   carpels. - Arabidopsis thaliana putative transcription factors AGL1 to AGL6 [6]. - Antirrhinum
   majus morphogenetic protein DEF H33 (squamosa).In SRF, the conserved domain has been shown [1] to
   be involved in DNA-binding and dimerization. A pattern that spans the complete length of the
   domain has been derived. The profile also spans the length of the MADS-box. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 671. Transketolase signatures </p>
  <p>[1006] Transketolase (EC 2.2.1.1) (TK) catalyzes the reversible transfer of a two-carbon ketol
   unit from xylulose 5-phosphate to an aldose receptor, such as ribose 5-phosphate, to form
   sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This enzyme, together with
   transaldolase, provides a link between the glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathways. TK requires
   thiamin pyrophosphate as a cofactor. In most sources where TK has been purified, it is a
   homodimer of approximately 70 Kd subunits. TK sequences from a variety of eukaryotic and
   prokaryotic sources [1,2] show that the enzyme has been evolutionarily conserved. In the
   peroxisomes of methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha, there is a highly related enzyme,
   dihydroxy-acetone synthase (DHAS) (EC 2.2.1.3) (also known as formaldehyde transketolase), which
   exhibits a very unusual specificity by including formaldehyde amongst its substrates.
   1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXP synthase) [3] is an enzyme so far found in bacteria
   (gene dxs) and plants (gene CLA1) which catalyzes the thiamin pyrophosphoate-dependent acyloin
   condensation reaction between carbon atoms 2 and 3 of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to
   yield 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (dxp), a precursor in the biosynthetic pathway to
   isoprenoids, thiamin (vitamin B1), and pyridoxol (vitamin B6). DXP synthase is evolutionary
   related to TK. Two regions of TK have been selected as signature patterns. The first, located in
   the N-terminal section, contains a histidine residue which appears to function inproton transfer
   during catalysis [4]. The second, located in the central section, contains conserved acidic
   residues that are part of the active cleft and may participate in substrate-binding [4].

  <p>[1007] Recently a number of eukaryotic cell surface antigens have been found to be evolutionary
   related [1,2,3]. The proteins known to belong to this family are listed below: - Mammalian
   antigen CD9 (MIC3); A protein involved in platelet activation and aggregation. - Mammalian
   leukocyte antigen CD37, expressed on B lymphocytes. - Mammalian leukocyte antigen CD53 (OX-44),
   which may be involved in growth regulation in hematopoietic cells. - Mammalian lysosomal membrane
   protein CD63 (melanoma-associated antigen ME491; antigen AD1). - Mammalian antigen CD81 (cell
   surface protein TAPA-1), which may play an important role in the regulation of lymphoma cell
   growth. - Mammalian antigen CD82 (protein R2; antigen C33; Kangai 1 (KAI1)), which associates
   with CD4 or CD8 and delivers costimulatory signals for the TCR/CD3 pathway. - Mammalian antigen
   CD151 (SFA-1; platelet-endothelial tetraspan antigen 3 (PETA-3)). - Mammalian cell surface
   glycoprotein A15 (TALLA-1; MXS1). - Mammalian novel antigen 2 (NAG-2). - Human tumor-associated
   antigen CO-029. - Schistosoma mansoni and japonicum 23 Kd surface antigen (SM23 / SJ23).These
   proteins share the following characteristics: they all seem to be type III membrane proteins
   (type III proteins are integral membrane proteins that contain a N-terminal membrane-anchoring
   domain which is not cleaved during biosynthesis and which functions both as a translocation
   signal and as a membrane anchor); they also contain three additional transmembrane regions, at
   least seven conserved cysteines residues, and are of approximately the same size (218 to 284
   residues). These proteins are collectively know as the 'transmembrane 4 super family' (TM4)
   because they span the plasma membrane four times. A schematic diagram of the domain structure of
   these proteins isshown below.

   indole andglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and the other for the synthesis of tryptophan fromindole and
   serine. In bacteria and plants [3], each domain is found on a separate subunit (alpha and beta
   chains), while in fungi the two domains are fused together on a single multifunctional protein. A

   The beta chain of the enzyme requires pyridoxal-phosphate as a cofactor. The pyridoxal-phosphate
   group is attached to a lysine residue. The region around this lysine residue also contains two
   histidine residues which are part of the pyridoxal-phosphate binding site. The signature pattern

  <p>[1012] Tubulins [1,2], the major constituent of microtubules are dimeric proteins which consist
   of two closely related subunits (alpha and beta). Tubulin binds two molecules of GTP at two
   different sites (N and E). At the E (Exchangeable) site, GTP is hydrolyzed during incorporation
   into the microtubule. Near the E site is an invariant region rich in glycines which is found in
   both chains andwhich is now [3] said to control the access of the nucleotide to its binding site.
   A signature pattern was developed from this region. With the exception of the simple eukaryotes,
   most species express a variety of closely related alpha and beta isotypes. In most species there
   is a third member of the tubulin family: gamma tubulin. Gamma tubulin is found at microtubule
   organizing centers (MTOC) such as the spindle poles or the centrosome, suggesting that it is
   involved in the minus-end nucleation of microtubule assembly [4]. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[1013] Tubulin-beta mRNA autoregulation signal The stability of beta-tubulin mRNAs are
   autoregulated by their own translation product [1]. Unpolymerized tubulin subunits bind directly
   (or activate a factor(s) which binds co-translationally) to the nascent N-terminus of
   beta-tubulin. This binding is transduced through the adjacent ribosomes to activatean RNAse that
   degrades the polysome-bound mRNA. The recognition element has been shown to be the first four
   amino acids of beta-tubulin: Met-Arg-Glu-Ile. Mutations to this sequence abolish the
   autoregulation effect (except for the replacement of Glu by Asp); transposition of this sequence
   to an internal region of a polypeptide also suppresses the autoregulatory effect. Consensus

  <p> 678. (tRNA-synt 2c) Aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases class-II signatures. </p>
  <p>[1014] Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (EC 6.1.1.-) [1] are a group of enzymes which activate amino
   acids and transfer them to specific tRNA molecules as the first step in protein biosynthesis. In
   prokaryotic organisms there are at least twenty different types of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases,
   one for each different amino acid. In eukaryotes there are generally two aminoacyl-tRNA
   synthetases for each different amino acid: one cytosolic form and a mitochondrial form. While all
   these enzymes have a common function, they are widely diverse in terms of subunit size and of
   quaternary structure. The synthetases specific for alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine,
   histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, and threonine are referred to as class-II
   synthetases [2 to 6] and probably have a common folding pattern in their catalytic domain for the
   binding of ATP and amino acid which is different to the Rossmann fold observed for the class I
   synthetases [7].Class-II tRNA synthetases do not share a high degree of similarity, however at
   least three conserved regions are present [2,5,8]. Signature patterns have been derived from two
   of these regions. Consensus pattern: [FYH]-R-x-[DE]-x(4,12)-[RH]-x(3)-F-x(3)-[DE]- Consensus

  <p> 684. UDP-glycosyltransferases signature </p>
  <p>[1020] UDP glycosyltransferases (UGT) are a superfamily of enzymes that catalyzes the addition
   of the glycosyl group from a UTP-sugar to a small hydrophobic molecule. This family currently
   consist of: - Mammalian UDP-glucoronosyl transferases (UDPGT) [1,2]. A large family of
   membrane-bound microsomal enzymes which catalyze the transfer of glucuronic acid to a wide
   variety of exogenous and endogenous lipophilic substrates. These enzymes are of major importance
   in the detoxification and subsequent elimination of xenobiotics such as drugs and carcinogens. -
   A large number of putative UDPGT from Caenorhabditis elegans. - Mammalian
   2-hydroxyacylsphingosine 1-beta-galactosyltransferase [3] (also known as UDP-galactose-ceramide
   galactosyltransferase). This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of galactose to ceramide, a key
   enzymatic step in the biosynthesis of galactocerebrosides, which are abundant sphingolipids of
   the myelin membrane of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. - Plants
   flavonol O(3)-glucosyltransferase. An enzyme [4] that catalyzes the transfer of glucose from
   UDP-glucose to a flavanol. This reaction is essential and one of the last steps in anthocyanin
   pigment biosynthesis. - Baculoviruses ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.-) [5] (egt).
   This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to ectysteroids which are insect
   molting hormones. The expression of egt in the insect host interferes with the normal insect
   development by blocking the molting process. - Prokaryotic zeaxanthin glucosyl transferase (gene
   crtX), an enzyme involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and that catalyses the glycosylation
   reaction which converts zeaxanthin to zeaxanthin-beta- diglucoside. - Streptomyces macrolide
   glycosyltransferases [6]. These enzymes specifically inactivates macrolide anitibiotics via
   2'-O-glycosylation using UDP-glucose.These enzymes share a conserved domain of about 50 amino
   acid residues locatedin their C-terminal section and from which a pattern has been extracted
   todetect them. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 686. Uracil-DNA glycosylase signature </p>
  <p>[1022] Uracil-DNA glycosylase (EC 3.2.2.-) (UNG) [1] is a DNA repair enzyme that excises uracil
   residues from DNA by cleaving the N-glycosylic bond. Uracil in DNA can arise as a result of
   misincorportation of dUMP residues by DNA polymerase or deamination of cytosine. The sequence of
   uracil-DNA glycosylase is extremely well conserved [2] in bacteria and eukaryotes as well as in
   herpes viruses. More distantly related uracil-DNA glycosylases are also found in poxviruses
   [3].In eukaryotic cells, UNG activity is found in both the nucleus and the mitochondria. Human
   UNG1 protein is transported to both the mitochondria and the nucleus [4]. The N-terminal 77 amino
   acids of UNG1 seem to be required for mitochondrial localization [4], but the presence of a
   mitochondrial transitpeptide has not been directly demonstrated. As a signature for this type of
   enzyme, the most N-termina conserved region has been selected. This region contains an aspartic
   acid residue which has been proposed, based on X-ray structures [5,6] to act as a general base in
   the catalytic mechanism. Consensus pattern: [KR]-[LIV]-[LIVC]-[LIVM]-x-G-[QI]-D-P-Y [D is the

  <p> 709. Ubiquitin domain signature and profile </p>
  <p>[1045] Ubiquitin [1,2,3] is a protein of seventy six amino acid residues, found in all
   eukaryotic cells and whose sequence is extremely well conserved from protozoan to vertebrates. It
   plays a key role in a variety of cellular processes, such as ATP-dependent selective degradation
   of cellular proteins,maintenance of chromatin structure, regulation of gene expression, stress
   response and ribosome biogenesis. In most species, there are many genes coding for ubiquitin.
   However they can be classified into two classes. The first class produces polyubiquitin molecules
   consisting of exact head to tail repeats of ubiquitin. The number of repeats is variable (up to
   twelve in a Xenopus gene). In the majority of polyubiquitin precursors, there is a final
   amino-acid after the last repeat. The second class of genes produces precursor proteins
   consisting of a single copy of ubiquitin fused to a C-terminal extension protein (CEP). There are
   two types of CEP proteins and both seem to be ribosomal proteins. Ubiquitin is a globular
   protein, the last four C-terminal residues (Leu-Arg- Gly-Gly) extending from the compact
   structure to form a 'tail', important for its function. The latter is mediated by the covalent
   conjugation of ubiquitin to target proteins, by an isopeptide linkage between the C-terminal
   glycine and the epsilon amino group of lysine residues in the target proteins. There are a number
   of proteins which are evolutionary related to ubiquitin: - Ubiquitin-like proteins from
   baculoviruses as well as in some strains of bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV). These proteins
   are highly similar to their eukaryotic counterparts. - Mammalian protein GDX [4]. GDX is composed
   of two domains, a N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of 74 residues and a C-terminal domain of 83
   residues with some similarity with the thyroglobulin hormonogenic site. - Mammalian protein FAU
   [5]. FAU is a fusion protein which consist of a N-terminal ubiquitin-like protein of 74 residues
   fused to ribosomal protein S30. - Mouse protein NEDD-8 [6], a ubiquitin-like protein of 81
   residues. - Human protein BAT3, a large fusion protein of 1132 residues that contains a
   N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain. - Caenorhabditis elegans protein ubl-1 [7]. Ubl-1 is a fusion
   protein which consist of a N-terminal ubiquitin-like protein of 70 residues fused to ribosomal
   protein S27A. - Yeast DNA repair protein RAD23 [8]. RAD23 contains a N-terminal domain that seems
   to be distantly, yet significantly, related to ubiquitin. - Mammalian RAD23-related proteins
   RAD23A and RAD23B. - Mammalian BCL-2 binding athanogene-1 (BAG-1). BAG-1 is a protein of 274
   residues that contains a central ubiquitin-like domain. - Human spliceosome associated protein
   114 (SAP 114 or SF3A120). - Yeast protein DSK2, a protein involved in spindle pole body
   duplication and which contains a N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain. - Human protein CKAP1/TFCB,
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe protein alp11 and Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F53F4.3.
   These proteins contain a N-terminal ubiquitin domain and a C-terminal CAP-Gly domain. -
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe hypothetical protein SpAC26A3.16. This protein contains a N-terminal
   ubiquitin domain. - Yeast protein SMT3. - Human ubiquitin-like proteins SMT3A and SMT3B. - Human
   ubiquitin-like protein SMT3C (also known as PIC1; Ubl1, Sumo-1; Gmp-1 or Sentrin). This protein
   is involved in targeting ranGAP1 to the nuclear pore complex protein ranBP2. - SMT3-like proteins
   in plants and Caenorhabditis elegans. To identify ubiquitin and related proteins, a pattern has
   been developed based on conserved positions in the central section of the sequence. A profile was
   also developed that spans the complete length of the ubiquitin domain. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 711. Vinculin family signatures </p>
  <p>[1047] Vinculin [1] is a eukaryotic protein that seems to be involved in the attachment of the
   actin-based microfilaments to the plasma membrane. Vinculinis located at the cytoplasmic side of
   focal contacts or adhesion plaques. In addition to actin, vinculin interacts with other
   structural proteins such as talin and alpha-actinins. Vinculin is a large protein of 116 Kd
   (about a 1000 residues). Structurally the protein consists of an acidic N-terminal domain of
   about 90 Kd separated from a basic C-terminal domain of about 25 Kd by a proline-rich region of
   about 50 residues. The central part of the N-terminal domain consists of avariable number (3 in
   vertebrates, 2 in Caenorhabditis elegans) of repeats of a 110 amino acids domain. Catenins [2]
   are proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic domain of avariety of cadherins. The association
   of catenins to cadherins produces a complex which is linked to the actin filament network, and
   which seems to be of primary importance for cadherins cell-adhesion properties. Three different
   types of catenins seem to exist: alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha-catenins are proteins of about 100
   Kd which are evolutionary related to vinculin. Interm of their structure the most significant
   differences are the absence, inalpha-catenin, of the repeated domain and of the proline-rich
   segment. Two signature patterns for this family of proteins have been devolped. The first pattern
   is located in the N-terminal section of both vinculin and alpha-catenins and is part, in
   vinculin, of a domain that seems to be involved with the interaction with talin. The second
   pattern is based on a conserved regionin the N-terminal part of the repeated domain of vinculin.

  <p>[1052] The von Willebrand factor is a large multimeric glycoprotein found in blood plasma.
   Mutant forms are involved in the aetiology of bleeding disorders [1]. In von Willebrand factor,
   the type A domain (vWF) is the prototype for a protein superfamily. The vWF domain is found in
   various plasma proteins: complement factors B, C2, CR3 and CR4; the integrins (I-domains);
   collagen types VI, VII, XII and XIV; and other extracellular proteins [2-4]. Proteins that
   incorporate vWF domains participate in numerous biological events (e.g., cell adhesion,
   migration, homing, pattern formation, and signal transduction), involving interaction with a
   large array of ligands [2]. Secondary structure prediction from 75 aligned vWF sequences has
   revealed a largely alternating sequence of alpha-helices and beta-strands [3]. Fold recognition
   algorithms were used to score sequence compatibility with a library of known structures: the vWF
   domain fold was predicted to be a doubly-wound, open, twisted beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices
   [5]. 3D structures have been determined for the I-domains of integrins CD11b (with bound
   magnesium) [6] and CD11a (with bound manganese) [7]. The domain adopts a classic alpha/beta
   Rossmann fold and contains an unusual metal ion coordination site at its surface. It has been
   suggested that this site represents a general metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) for
   binding protein ligands [6]. The residues constituting the MIDAS motif in the CD11b and CD11a
   I-domains are completely conserved, but the manner in which the metal ion is coordinated differs
   slightly [7]. </p>
  <p>[1053] VWFADOMAIN is a 3-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the vWF domain
   superfamily. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 14 sequences. Motif 1
   includes the first beta-strand and 3 conserved residues involved in metal ion coordination in
   I-domains (Asp and 2 serines in positions 8, 10 and 12, respectively); motif 2 spans strands
   beta-2 and beta-2'; and motif 3 encodes beta-strand 3 and a conserved Asp (in position 7), which
   coordinates the metal ion [6,7]. Three iterations on OWL27.0 were required to reach convergence,
   at which point a true set comprising 56 sequences was identified. Numerous partial matches were
   also found. </p>

   anchoring and receptor recognition. </p>
  <p>[1055] In higher eukaryotes G-beta exists as a small multigene family of highly conserved
   proteins of about 340 amino acid residues. Structurally G-beta consists of eight tandem repeats
   of about 40 residues, each containing a central Trp-Asp motif (this type of repeat is sometimes
   called a WD-40 repeat). Such a repetitive segment has been shown [E1,2,3,4,5] to exist in a
   number of other proteins listed below: Yeast STE4, a component of the pheromone response pathway.
   STE4 is a G-beta like protein that associates with GPA1 (G-alpha) and STE18 (G-gamma). Yeast
   MSI1, a negative regulator of RAS-mediated cAMP synthesis. MSI1 is most probably also a G-beta
   protein. Human and chicken protein 12.3. The function of this protein is not known, but on the
   basis of its similarity to G-beta proteins, it may also function in signal transduction.
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii gblp. This protein is most probably the homolog of vertebrate protein
   12.3. Human LIS1, a neuronal protein involved in type-1 lissencephaly [E2]. Mammalian coatomer
   beta' subunit (beta'-COP), a component of a cytosolic protein complex that reversibly associates
   with Golgi membranes to form vesicles that mediate biosynthetic protein transport. Yeast CDC4,
   essential for initiation of DNA replication and separation of the spindle pole bodies to form the
   poles of the mitotic spindle. Yeast CDC20, a protein required for two microtubule-dependent
   processes: nuclear movements prior to anaphase and chromosome separation. Yeast MAK11, essential
   for cell growth and for the replication of M1 double-stranded RNA. Yeast PRP4, a component of the
   U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein with a probable role in mRNA splicing. Yeast PWP1, a
   protein of unknown function. Yeast SKI8, a protein essential for controlling the propagation of
   double-stranded RNA. Yeast SOF1, a protein required for ribosomal RNA processing which associates
   with U3 small nucleolar RNA. Yeast TUP1 (also known as AER2 or SFL2 or CYC9), a protein which has
   been implicated in dTMP uptake, catabolite repression, mating sterility, and many other
   phenotypes. Yeast YCR57c, an ORF of unknown function from chromosome III. Yeast YCR72c, an ORF of
   unknown function from chromosome III. Slime mold coronin, an actin-binding protein. Slime mold
   AAC3, a developmentally regulated protein of unknown function. Drosophila protein Groucho
   (formerly known as E(spl); 'enhancer of split'), a protein involved in neurogenesis and that
   seems to interact with the Notch and Delta proteins. Drosophila TAF-II-80, a protein that is
   tightly associated with TFIID. </p>
  <p>[1056] The number of repeats in the above proteins varies between 5 (PRP4, TUP1, and Groucho)
   and 8 (G-beta, STE4, MSI1, AAC3, CDC4, PWP1, etc.). In G-beta and G-beta like proteins, the
   repeats span the entire length of the sequence, while in other proteins, they make up the
   N-terminal, the central or the C-terminal section. </p>
  <p>[1057] A signature pattern can be developed from the central core of the domain (positions 9 to
   23). Consensus pattern: [LIVMSTAC]-[LIVMFYWSTAGC]-[LIMSTAG]-[LIVMSTAGC]-x(2)-[DN]-

  <p> 718. WHEP-TRS domain containing proteins </p>
  <p>[1058] A conserved domain of 46 amino acids has been shown [1] to exist in a number of higher
   eukaryote aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases. This domain is present one to six times in the
   following enzymes: Mammalian multifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The domain is present
   three times in a region that separates the N-terminal glutamyl-tRNA synthetase domain from the
   C-terminal prolyl-tRNA synthetase domain. Drosophila multifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.
   The domain is present six times in the intercatalytic region. Mammalian tryptophanyl-tRNA
   synthetase. The domain is found at the N-terminal extremity. Mammalian, insect, nematode and
   plant glycyl-tRNA synthetase. The domain is found at the N-terminal extremity [2]. Mammalian
   histidyl-tRNA synthetase. The domain is found at the N-terminal extremity. </p>
  <p>[1059] This domain, which is called WHEP-TRS, could contain a central alpha-helical region and
   may play a role in the association of tRNA-synthetases into multienzyme complexes. </p>
  <p>[1060] A signature pattern based on the first 29 positions of the WHEP-Domain has been
   developed. Consensus pattern:

  <p> 720. Xylose isomerase </p>
  <p>[1062] Xylose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.5) [1] is an enzyme found in microorganisms which catalyzes
   the interconversion of D-xylose to D-xylulose. It can also isomerize D-ribose to D-ribulose and
   D-glucose to D-fructose. Xylose isomerase seems to require magnesium for its activity, while
   cobalt is necessary to stabilize the tetrameric structure of the enzyme. A number of residues are
   conserved in all known xylose isomerases. </p>
  <p>[1063] Xylose isomerase also exists in plants [2] where it is homodimeric and is
   manganese-dependent. </p>
  <p>[1064] Two signatures patterns for xylose isomerase have been developed. The first one is
   derived from a stretch of five conserved amino acids that includes a glutamic acid residue known
   to be one of the four residues involved in the binding of the magnesium ion [3]; this pattern
   also includes a lysine residue which is involved in the catalytic activity. The second pattern is
   derived from a conserved region in the N-terminal section of the enzyme that include an histidine
   residue which has been shown [4] to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.

  <p> 721. XPG protein signatures. </p>
  <p>[1065] Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) [1] is a human autosomal recessive disease, characterized by
   a high incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancer. People's skin cells with this condition are
   hypersensitive to ultraviolet light, due to defects in the incision step of DNA excision repair.
   There are a minimum of seven genetic complementation groups involved in this pathway: XP-A to
   XP-G. The defect in XP-G can be corrected by a 133 Kd nuclear protein called XPG (or XPGC)
   [2].XPG belongs to a family of proteins [2,3,4,5,6] that are composed of twomain subsets: -
   Subset 1, to which belongs XPG, RAD2 from budding yeast and radl3 from fission yeast. RAD2 and
   XPG are single-stranded DNA endonucleases [7,8]. XPG makes the 3'incision in human DNA nucleotide
   excision repair [9]. - Subset 2, to which belongs mouse and human FEN-1, rad2 from fission yeast,
   and RAD27 from budding yeast. FEN-1 is a structure-specific endonuclease. In addition to the
   proteins listed in the above groups, this family also includes: - Fission yeast exol, a 5'-&gt;3'
   double-stranded DNA exonuclease that could act in a pathway that corrects mismatched base pairs.
   - Yeast EXO1 (DHS1), a protein with probably the same function as exol. - Yeast DIN7.Sequence
   alignment of this family of proteins reveals that similarities are largely confined to two
   regions. The first is located at the N-terminal extremity (N-region) and corresponds to the first
   95 to 105 amino acids. The second region is internal (I-region) and found towards the C-terminus
   ; it spans about 140 residues and contains a highly conserved core of 27 amino acids that
   includes a conserved pentapeptide (E-A-[DE]-A-[QS]). It is possible that the conserved acidic
   residues are involved in the catalytic mechanism of DNA excision repair in XPG. The amino acids
   linking the N- and I-regions are not conserved; indeed, they are largely absent from proteins
   belonging to the second subset. Two signature patterns have been developed for these proteins.
   The first corresponds to the central part of the N-region, the second to part of the I-region and
   includes the putative catalytic core pentapeptide Consensus pattern:

  <p>[1073] There are a number of different types of zinc-dependent carboxypeptidases (EC 3.4.17.-)
   [1,2]. All these enzymes seem to be structurally and functionally related. The enzymes that
   belong to this family are listed below. Carboxypeptidase A1 (EC 3.4.17.1), a pancreatic digestive
   enzyme that can removes all C-terminal amino acids with the exception of Arg, Lys and Pro.
   Carboxypeptidase A2 (EC 3.4.17.15), a pancreatic digestive enzyme with a specificity similar to
   that of carboxypeptidase A1, but with a preference for bulkier C-terminal residues.
   Carboxypeptidase B (EC 3.4.17.2), also a pancreatic digestive enzyme, but that preferentially
   removes C-terminal Arg and Lys. Carboxypeptidase N (EC 3.4.17.3) (also known as arginine
   carboxypeptidase), a plasma enzyme which protects the body from potent vasoactive and
   inflammatory peptides containing C-terminal Arg or Lys (such as kinins or anaphylatoxins) which
   are released into the circulation. Carboxypeptidase H (EC 3.4.17.10) (also known as enkephalin
   convertase or carboxypeptidase E), an enzyme located in secretory granules of pancreatic islets,
   adrenal gland, pituitary and brain. This enzyme removes residual C-terminal Arg or Lys remaining
   after initial endoprotease cleavage during prohormone processing. Carboxypeptidase M (EC
   3.4.17.12), a membrane bound Arg and Lys specific enzyme. It is ideally situated to act on
   peptide hormones at local tissue sites where it could control their activity before or after
   interaction with specific plasma membrane receptors. Mast cell carboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.17.1), an
   enzyme with a specificity to carboxypeptidase A, but found in the secretory granules of mast
   cells. Streptomyces griseus carboxypeptidase (Cpase SG) (EC 3.4.17.-) [3], which combines the
   specificities of mammalian carboxypeptidases A and B. Thermoactinomyces vulgaris carboxypeptidase
   T (EC 3.4.17.18) (CPT) [4], which also combines the specificities of carboxypeptidases A and B.
   AEBP1 [5], a transcriptional repressor active in preadipocytes. AEBP1 seems to regulate
   transcription by cleavage of other transcriptional proteins. Yeast hypothetical protein YHR132c. </p>
  <p>[1074] All of these enzymes bind an atom ofzinc. Three conserved residues are implicated in the

  <p> 726. Zinc finger, C2H2 type </p>
  <p>[1075] The C2H2 zinc finger is the classical zinc finger domain. The two conserved cysteines
   and histidines co-ordinate a zinc ion. The following pattern describes the zinc finger.
   #-X-C-X(1-5)-C-X3-#-X5-#-X2-H-X(3-6)-[H/C] Where X can be any amino acid, and numbers in brackets
   indicate the number of residues. The positions marked # are those that are important for the
   stable fold of the zinc finger. The final position can be either his or cys. The C2H2 zinc finger
   is composed of two short beta strands followed by an alpha helix. The amino terminal part of the
   helix binds the major groove in DNA binding zinc fingers. </p>
  <p>[1076] 'Zinc finger' domains [1-5] are nucleic acid-binding protein structures first identified
   in the Xenopus transcription factor TFIIIA. These domains have since been found in numerous
   nucleic acid-binding proteins. A zinc finger domain is composed of 25 to 30 amino-acid residues.
   There are two cysteine or histidine residues at both extremities of the domain, which are
   involved in the tetrahedral coordination of a zinc atom. It has been proposed that such a domain
   interacts with about five nucleotides. A schematic representation of a zinc finger domain is
   shown below: EMI565.1 </p>
  <p>[1077] Many classes of zinc fingers are characterized according to the number and positions of
   the histidine and cysteine residues involved in the zinc atom coordination. In the first class to
   be characterized, called C2H2, the first pair of zinc coordinating residues are cysteines, while
   the second pair are histidines. A number of experimental reports have demonstrated the
   zinc-dependent DNA or RNA binding property of some members of this class. </p>
  <p>[1078] Some of the proteins known to include C2H2-type zinc fingers are listed below. The
   number of zinc finger regions found in each of these proteins are indicated between brackets; a
   '+' symbol indicates that only partial sequence data is available and that additional finger
   domains may be present. Saccharomyces cerevisiae: ACE2 (3), ADR1 (2), AZF1 (4), FZF1 (5), MIG1

  <p>[1079] In addition to the conserved zinc ligand residues it has been shown [6] that a number of

  <p> 727. Zinc finger, C3HC4 type (RING finger) </p>
  <p>[1080] A number of eukaryotic and viral proteins contain a conserved cysteine-rich domain of 40
   to 60 residues (called C3HC4 zinc-finger or 'RING' finger) [1] that binds two atoms of zinc, and
   is probably involved in mediating protein-protein interactions. The 3D structure of the zinc
   ligation system is unique to the RING domain and is refered to as the &quot;cross-brace&quot;
   motif. The spacing of the cysteines in such a domain is C-x(2)-C-x(9 to 39)-C-x(1 to 3)-H-x(2 to
   3)-C-x(2)-C-x(4 to 48)-C-x(2)-C. </p>

   only provided for recently determined sequences). Mammalian V(D)J recombination activating
   protein (gene RAG1). RAG1 activates the rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor
   genes. Mouse rpt-1. Rpt-1 is a trans-acting factor that regulates gene expression directed by the
   promoter region of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain or the LTR promoter region of HIV-1.

  <p>[1089] The 14-3-3 proteins [1,2,3] are a family of closely related acidic homodimeric proteins
   of about 30 Kd which were first identified as being very abundant in mammalian brain tissues and
   located preferentially in neurons. The 14-3-3 proteins seem to have multiple biological
   activities and play a key role in signal transduction pathways and the cell cycle. They interacts
   with kinases such as PKC or Raf-1; they seem to also function as protein-kinase dependent
   activators of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases and in plants they are associated with a
   complex that binds to the G-box promoter elements. </p>
  <p>[1090] The 14-3-3 family of proteins are ubiquitously found in all eukaryotic species studied
   and have been sequenced in fungi (yeast BMH1 and BMH2, fission yeast rad24 and rad25), plants,
   Drosophila, and vertebrates. The sequences of the 14-3-3 proteins are extremely well conserved.
   Two highly conserved regions have been selected as signature patterns: the first is a peptide of

  <p> 733. D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases (2 Hacid DH) </p>
  <p>[1091] This Pfam covers the Formate dehydrogenase, D-glycerate dehydrogenase and D-lactate
   dehydrogenase families in SCOP. A number of NAD-dependent 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases which seem
   to be specific for the D-isomer of their substrate have been shown [1,2,3,4] to be functionally
   and structurally related. These enzymes are listed below. D-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.28),
   a bacterial enzyme which catalyzes the reduction of D-lactate to pyruvate. D-glycerate
   dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.29) (NADH-dependent hydroxypyruvate reductase), a plant leaf peroxisomal
   enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of hydroxypyruvate to glycerate. This reaction is part of the
   glycolate pathway of photorespiration. D-glycerate dehydrogenase from the bacteria Hyphomicrobium
   methylovorum and Methylobacterium extorquens. 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.95), a
   bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of D-3-phosphoglycerate to
   3-phosphohydroxypyruvate. This reaction is the first committed step in the 'phosphorylated'
   pathway of serine biosynthesis. Erythronate-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.-) (gene pdxB), a
   bacterial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). D-2-hydroxyisocaproate
   dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.-) (D-hicDH), a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the reversible and
   stereospecific interconversion between 2-ketocarboxylic acids and D-2-hydroxy-carboxylic acids.
   Formate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2) (FDH) from the bacteria Pseudomonas sp. 101 and various fungi
   [5]. Vancomycin resistance protein vanH from Enterococcus faecium; this protein is a D-specific
   alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase involved in the formation of a peptidoglycan which does not
   terminate by D-alanine thus preventing vancomycin binding. Escherichia coli hypothetical protein
   ycdW. Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yiaE. Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein
   HI1556. Yeast hypothetical protein YER081w. Yeast hypothetical protein YIL074w. </p>
  <p>[1092] All these enzymes have similar enzymatic activities and are structurally related. Three
   of the most conserved regions of these proteins have been selected to develop patterns. The first
   pattern is based on a glycine-rich region located in the central section of these enzymes; this
   region probably corresponds to the NAD-binding domain. The two other patterns contain a number of
   conserved charged residues, some of which may play a role in the catalytic mechanism. Consensus

  <p>[1096] 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35) (HCDH) [1] is an enzyme involved in fatty
   acid metabolism, it catalyzes the reduction of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 3-oxoacyl-CoA. Most
   eukaryotic cells have 2 fatty-acid beta-oxidation systems, one located in mitochondria and the
   other in peroxisomes. In peroxisomes 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase forms, with enoyl-CoA
   hydratase (ECH) and 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoAisomerase (ECI) a multifunctional enzyme where the
   N-terminal domain bears the hydratase/isomerase activities and the C-terminal domain the
   dehydrogenase activity. There are two mitochondrial enzymes: one which is monofunctional and the
   other which is, like its peroxisomal counterpart, multifunctional. </p>
  <p>[1097] In Escherichia coli (gene fadB) and Pseudomonas fragi (gene faoA) HCDH is part of a
   multifunctional enzyme which also contains an ECH/ECI domain as well as a 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
   epimerase domain [2]. </p>
  <p>[1098] The other proteins structurally related to HCDH are: Bacterial 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
   dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.157) which reduces 3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA [3]. Eye lens
   protein lambda-crystallin [4], which is specific to lagomorphes (such as rabbit). </p>
  <p>[1099] There are two major region of similarities in the sequences of proteins of the HCDH
   family, the first one located in the N-terminal, corresponds to the NAD-binding site, the second
   one is located in the center of the sequence. A signature pattern has been derived from this
   central region. Consensus pattern:

   herpesvirus saimiri. </p>
  <p>*[1104] The structure of all these receptors is thought to be identical. They have seven
   hydrophobic regions, each of which most probably spans the membrane. The N-terminus is located on
   the extracellular side of the membrane and is often glycosylated, while the C-terminus is
   cytoplasmic and generally phosphorylated. Three extracellular loops alternate with three
   intracellular loops to link the seven transmembrane regions. Most, but not all of these
   receptors, lack a signal peptide. The most conserved parts of these proteins are the
   transmembrane regions and the first two cytoplasmic loops. A conserved acidic-Arg-aromatic
   triplet is present in the N-terminal extremity of the second cytoplasmic loop [15] and could be
   implicated in the interaction with G proteins. </p>
  <p>[1105] To detect this widespread family of proteins, a pattern that contains the conserved
   triplet and that also spans the major part of the third transmembrane helix has been developed.

   consist of an apoprotein, opsin, covalently linked to the chromophore cis-retinal. Vision is
   effected through the absorption of a photon by cis-retinal which is isomerized to trans-retinal.
   This isomerization leads to a change of conformation of the protein. Opsins are integral membrane
   proteins with seven transmembrane regions that belong to family 1 of G-protein coupled receptors. </p>
  <p>[1107] In vertebrates four different pigments are generally found. Rod cells, which mediate
   vision in dim light, contain the pigment rhodopsin. Cone cells, which function in bright light,
   are responsible for color vision and contain three or more color pigments (for example, in
   mammals: red, blue and green). </p>
  <p>[1108] In Drosophila, the eye is composed of 800 facets or ommatidia. Each ommatidium contains
   eight photoreceptor cells (R1-R8): the R1 to R6 cells are outer cells, R7 and R8 inner cells.
   Each of the three types of cells (R1-R6, R7 and R8) expresses a specific opsin. </p>
  <p>[1109] Proteins evolutionary related to opsins include squid retinochrome, also known as
   retinal photoisomerase, which converts various isomers of retinal into 11-cis retinal and
   mammalian retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) RGR [3], a protein that may also act in retinal
   isomerization. </p>
  <p>[1110] The attachment site for retinal in the above proteins is a conserved lysine residue in
   the middle of the seventh transmembrane helix. The pattern that had been developed includes this
   residue. Consensus pattern: [LIVMWAC]-[PGC]-x(3)-[SAC]-K-[STALIMR]-[GSACPNV]-[STACP]-

  <p>[1114] The major protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes is a porin that

   for small hydrophilic molecules [1 to 4]. The channel adopts an open conformation at low or zero
   membrane potential and a closed conformation at potentials above 30-40 mV. This protein contains
   about 280 amino acids and its sequence is composed of between 12 to 16 beta-strands that span the
   mitochondrial outer membrane. Yeast contains two members of this family (genes POR1 and POR2);
   vertebrates have at least three members (genes VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3) [5]. A conserved region
   located at the C-terminal part of these proteins was selected as a signature pattern. Consensus

  <p>[1115] Chitinases family 19 signatures cross-reference(s) CHITINASE_19_1, CHITINASE_19_2
   Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) [1] are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the beta-
   1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine linkages in chitin polymers. From the view point of sequence
   similarity chitinases belong to either family 18 or 19 in the classification of glycosyl
   hydrolases [2,E1]. Chitinases of family 19 (also known as classes IA or I and IB or II) are
   enzymes from plants that function in the defense against fungal and insect pathogens by
   destroying their chitin-containing cell wall. Class IA/I and IB/II enzymes differ in the presence
   (IA/I) or absence (IB/II) of a N-terminal chitin-binding domain (see the relevant entry
   &lt;PDOC00025&gt;). The catalytic domain of these enzymes consist of about 220 to 230 amino acid
   residues. Two highly conserved regions were selected as signature patterns, the first one is
   located in the N-terminal section and contains one of the six cysteines which are conserved in
   most, if not all, of these chitinases and which is probably involved in a disulfide bond.

   THIOL_PROTEASE_CYS; THIOL_PROTEASE_HIS; THIOL_PROTEASE_ASN Eukaryotic thiol proteases (EC
   3.4.22.-) [1] are a family of proteolytic enzymes which contain an active site cysteine.
   Catalysis proceeds through a thioester intermediate and is facilitated by a nearby histidine side
   chain; an asparagine completes the essential catalytic triad. The proteases which are currently
   known to belong to this family are listed below (references are only provided for recently
   determined sequences). Vertebrate lysosomal cathepsins B (EC 3.4.22.1), H (EC 3.4.22.16), L (EC

   (also known as cathepsin C) [2]. Vertebrate calpains (EC 3.4.22.17). Calpains are intracellular
   calcium- activated thiol protease that contain both a N-terminal catalytic domain and a
   C-terminal calcium-binding domain. Mammalian cathepsin K, which seems involved in osteoclastic
   bone resorption [3]. Human cathepsin O [4]. Bleomycin hydrolase. An enzyme that catalyzes the

  <p>[1119] Three other proteins are structurally related to this family, but may have lost their
   proteolytic activity. Soybean oil body protein P34. This protein has its active site cysteine
   replaced by a glycine. Rat testin, a sertoli cell secretory protein highly similar to cathepsin L
   but with the active site cysteine is replaced by a serine. Rat testin should not be confused with
   mouse testin which is a LIM-domain protein (see &lt;PDOC00382&gt;). Plasmodium falciparum
   serine-repeat protein (SERA), the major blood stage antigen. This protein of 111 Kd possesses a
   C-terminal thiol-protease-like domain [6], but the active site cysteine is replaced by a serine.

  <p> 748. Tyrosinase signatures cross-reference(s) TYROSINASE_1; TYROSINASE_2 </p>
  <p>[1123] Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) [1] is a copper monooxygenases that catalyzes the
   hydroxylation of monophenols and the oxidation of o-diphenols to o-quinols. This enzyme, found in
   prokaryotes as well as in eukaryotes, is involved in the formation of pigments such as melanins
   and other polyphenolic compounds. </p>
  <p>[1124] Tyrosinase binds two copper ions (CuA and CuB). Each of the two copper ion has been
   shown [2] to be bound by three conserved histidines residues. The regions around these
   copper-binding ligands are well conserved and also shared by some hemocyanins, which are
   copper-containing oxygen carriers from the hemolymph of many molluscs and arthropods [3,4]. </p>
  <p>[1125] At least two proteins related to tyrosinase are known to exist in mammals: TRP-1 (TYRP1)
   [5], which is responsible for the conversion of 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) to
   indole-5,6-quinone-2-carboxylic acid. TRP-2 (TYRP2) [6], which is the melanogenic enzyme
   DOPAchrome tautomerase (EC 5.3.3.12) that catalyzes the conversion of DOPAchrome to DHICA. TRP-2
   differs from tyrosinases and TRP-1 in that it binds two zinc ions instead of copper [7]. </p>
  <p>[1126] Other proteins that belong to this family are: Plants polyphenol oxidases (PPO) (EC
   1.10.3.1) which catalyze the oxidation of mono- and o-diphenols to o-diquinones [8].

  <p> 752. EPSP synthase signatures </p>
  <p>[1156] EPSP synthase (3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase) (EC 2.5.1.19) catalyzes the
   sixth step in the biosynthesis from chorismate of the aromatic amino acids (the shikimate
   pathway) in bacteria (gene aroA), plants and fungi (where it is part of a multifunctional enzyme
   which catalyzes five consecutive steps in this pathway) [1]. EPSP synthase has been extensively
   studied as it is the target of the potent herbicide glyphosate which inhibits the enzyme. </p>
  <p>[1157] The sequence of EPSP from various biological sources shows that the structure of the
   enzyme has been well conserved throughout evolution. Two conserved regions were selected as
   signature patterns. The first pattern corresponds to a region that is part of the active site and
   which is also important for the resistance to glyphosate [2]. The second pattern is located in
   the C-terminal part of the protein and contains a conserved lysine which seems to be important
   for the activity of the enzyme. </p>

  <p> 755. (HMA) Heavy-metal-associated domain </p>
  <p>[1162] A conserved domain of about 30 amino acid residues has been found [1] in a number of
   proteins that transport or detoxify heavy metals. This domain contains two conserved cysteines
   that could be involved in the binding of these metals. The domain has been termed
   Heavy-Metal-Associated (HMA). It has been found in: A variety of cation transport ATPases (E1-E2
   ATPases) (see &lt;PDOC00139&gt;). The human copper ATPAses ATP7A and ATP7B which are respectively
   involved in Menke's and Wilson's diseases. ATP7A and ATP7B both contain 6 tandem copies of the
   HMA domain. The copper ATPases CCC2 from budding yeast, copA from Enterococcus faecalis and synA
   from Synechococcus contain one copy of the HMA domain. The cadmium ATPases cadA from Bacillus
   firmus and from plasmid pI258 from Staphylococcus aureus also contain a single HMA domain, while
   a chromosomal Staphylococcus aureus cadA contains two copies. Other, less characterized ATPases
   that contain the HMA domain are: fixI from Rhizobium meliloti, pacS from Synechococcus strain PCC
   7942), Mycobacterium leprae ctpA and ctpB and Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhhO. In all
   these ATPases the HMA domain(s) are located in the N-terminal section. Mercuric reductase (EC
   1.16.1.1) (gene merA) which is generally encoded by plasmids carried by mercury-resistant
   Gram-negative bacteria. Mercuric reductase is a class-1 pyridine nucleotide-disulphide
   oxidoreductase (see &lt;PDOC00073&gt;). There is generally one HMA domain (with the exception of
   a chromosomal merA from Bacillus strain RC607 which has two) in the N-terminal part of merA.
   Mercuric transport protein periplasmic component (gene merP), also encoded by plasmids carried by
   mercury-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. It seems to be a mercury scavenger that specifically
   binds to one Hg(2+) ion and which passes it to the mercuric reductase via the merT protein. The
   N-terminal half of merP is a HMA domain. Helicobacter pylori copper-binding protein copP. Yeast
   protein ATX1 [2], which could act in the transport and/or partitioning of copper. </p>

  <p> 756. (Peptidase M10) Matrixins cysteine switch </p>
  <p>[1165] PROSITE cross-reference(s): CYSTEINE_SWITCH Mammalian extracellular matrix
   metalloproteinases (EC 3.4.24.-), also known as matrixins [1] (see &lt;PDOC00129&gt;), are
   zinc-dependent enzymes. They are secreted by cells in an inactive form (zymogen) that differs
   from the mature enzyme by the presence of an N-terminal propeptide. A highly conserved
   octapeptide is found two residues downstream of the C-terminal end of the propeptide. This region
   has been shown to be involved in autoinhibition of matrixins [2,3]; a cysteine within the
   octapeptide chelates the active site zinc ion, thus inhibiting the enzyme. This region has been
   called the 'cysteine switch' or 'autoinhibitor region'. A cysteine switch has been found in the
   following zinc proteases: MMP-1 (EC 3.4.24.7) (interstitial collagenase). MMP-2 (EC 3.4.24.24)
   (72 Kd gelatinase). MMP-3 (EC 3.4.24.17) (stromelysin-1). MMP-7 (EC 3.4.24.23) (matrilysin).

   SUBTILASE_SER Subtilases [1,2] are an extensive family of serine proteases whose catalytic
   activity is provided by a charge relay system similar to that of the trypsin family of serine
   proteases but which evolved by independent convergent evolution. The sequence around the residues

   from that of the analogous residues in the trypsin serine proteases and can be used as signatures
   specific to that category of proteases. The subtilase family currently includes the following
   proteases: Subtilisins (EC 3.4.21.62), these alkaline proteases from various Bacillus species

  <p>[1169] PROSITE cross-reference(s): PS00735; SSB_1,PS00736; SSB_2 The Escherichia coli
   single-strand binding protein [1] (gene ssb), also known as the helix-destabilizing protein, is a
   protein of 177 amino acids. It binds tightly, as a homotetramer, to single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA)
   and plays an important role in DNA replication, recombination and repair. </p>
  <p>[1170] Closely related variants of SSB are encoded in the genome of a variety of large
   self-transmissible plasmids. SSB has also been characterized in bacteria such as Proteus

  <p>[1171] Eukaryotic mitochondrial proteins that bind ss-DNA and are probably involved in
   mitochondrial DNA replication are structurally and evolutionary related to prokaryotic SSB.
   Proteins currently known to belong to this subfamily are listed below [2]. Mammalian protein

  <p>[1172] Two signature patterns have been developed for these proteins. The first is a conserved

  <p>[1179] DNA damaging agents such as the antitumor drugs bleomycin and neocarzinostatin or those
   that generate oxygen radicals produce a variety of lesions in DNA. Amongst these is base-loss
   which forms apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites or strand breaks with atypical 3'termini. DNA repair
   at the AP sites is initiated by specific endonuclease cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone.
   Such endonucleases are also generally capable of removing blocking groups from the 3'terminus of
   DNA strand breaks. </p>
  <p>[1180] AP endonucleases can be classified into two families on the basis of sequence
   similarity. Family 1 groups the enzymes listed below [1]. Escherichia coli exonuclease III (EC
   3.1.11.2) (gene xthA). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis exonuclease A (gene exoA).
   Mammalian AP endonuclease 1 (AP1) (EC 4.2.99.18). Drosophila recombination repair protein 1 (gene
   Rrp1). Arabidopsis thaliana apurinic endonuclease-redox protein (gene arp). </p>
  <p>[1181] Except for Rrp1 and arp, these enzymes are proteins of about 300 amino-acid residues.
   Rrp1 and arp both contain additional and unrelated sequences in their N-terminal section (about
   400 residues for Rrp1 and 270 for arp). </p>
  <p>[1182] Three signature patterns were developed for this family of enzymes. The patterns are
   based on the most conserved regions. The first pattern contains a glutamate which has been shown

   residues whose function is not yet clear. From an evolutionary point of view, it is highly

  <p>[1185] The electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) [1,2] serves as a specific electron acceptor
   for various mitochondrial dehydrogenases. ETF transfers electrons to the main respiratory chain
   via ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase. ETF is an heterodimer that consist of an alpha and a beta
   subunit and which bind one molecule of FAD per dimer. A similar system also exists in some
   bacteria. </p>
  <p>[1186] The alpha subunit of ETF is a protein of about 32 Kd which is structurally related to

  <p> 763. (lectin c) C-type lectin domain signature and profile </p>
  <p>[1189] PROSITE cross-reference(s): PS00615; C_TYPE LECTIN_1, PS50041; C_TYPE_LECTIN_2 </p>
  <p> [1190] A number of different families of proteins share a conserved domain which was first
   characterized in some animal lectins and which seem to function as a calcium-dependent
   carbohydrate-recognition domain [1,2,3]. This domain, which is known as the C-type lectin domain
   (CTL) or as the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), consists of about 110 to 130 residues.
   There are four cysteines which are perfectly conserved and involved in two disulfide bonds. A
   schematic representation of the CTL domain is shown below. EMI606.1 </p>
  <p>[1191] The categories of proteins, in which the CTL domain has been found, are listed below. </p>
  <p>[1192] Type-II membrane proteins where the CTL domain is located at the C-terminal extremity of
   the proteins: Asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPR) (also known as hepatic lectins) [4]. The
   ASGPR's mediate the endocytosis of plasma glycoproteins to which the terminal sialic acid residue
   in their carbohydrate moieties has been removed. Low affinity immunoglobulin epsilon Fc receptor
   (lymphocyte IgE receptor), which plays an essential role in the regulation of IgE production and
   in the differentiation of B cells. Kupffer cell receptor. A receptor with an affinity for
   galactose and fucose, that could be involved in endocytosis. A number of proteins expressed on
   the surface of natural killer T-cells: NKG2, NKR-P 1, YE1/88 (Ly-49), CD69 and on B-cells: CD72,
   LyB-2. The CTL- domain in these proteins is distantly related to other CTL-domains; it is unclear
   whether they are likely to bind carbohydrates. </p>
  <p>[1193] Proteins that consist of an N-terminal collagenous domain followed by a CTL- domain [5],
   these proteins are sometimes called 'collectins': Pulmonary surfactant-associated protein A
   (SP-A). SP-A is a calcium-dependent protein that binds to surfactant phospholipids and
   contributes to lower the surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli of the
   mammalian lung. Pulmonary surfactant-associated protein D (SP-D). Conglutinin, a
   calcium-dependent lectin-like protein which binds to a yeast cell wall extract and to immune
   complexes through the complement component (iC3b). Mannan-binding proteins (MBP) (also known as
   mannose-binding proteins). MBP's bind mannose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in a calcium-dependent
   manner. Bovine collectin-43 (CL-43). </p>
  <p>[1194] Selectins (or LEC-CAM) [6,7]. Selectins are cell adhesion molecules implicated in the
   interaction of leukocytes with platelets or vascular endothelium. Structurally, selectins consist
   of a long extracellular domain, followed by a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic
   domain. The extracellular domain is itself composed of a CTL-domain, followed by an EGF-like
   domain and a variable number of SCR/Sushi repeats. Known selectins are: Lymph node homing
   receptor (also known as L-selectin, leukocyte adhesion molecule-1. (LAM-1), leu-8, gp90-mel, or
   LECAM-1) Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (ELAM-1, E-selectin or LECAM-2). The ligand
   recognized by ELAM-1 is sialyl-Lewis x. Granule membrane protein 140 (GMP-140, P-selectin,
   PADGEM, CD62, or LECAM-3). The ligand recognized by GMP-140 is Lewis x. </p>
  <p>[1195] Large proteoglycans that contain a CTL-domain followed by one copy of a SCR/ Sushi
   repeat, in their C-terminal section: Aggrecan (cartilage-specific proteoglycan core protein).
   This proteoglycan is a major component of the extracellular matrix of cartilagenous tissues where
   it has a role in the resistance to compression. Brevican. Neurocan. Versican (large fibroblast
   proteoglycan), a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that may play a role in intercellular
   signalling. </p>
  <p>[1196] In addition to the CTL and Sushi domains, these proteins also contain, in their
   N-terminal domain, an Ig-like V-type region, two or four link domains (see &lt;PDOC00955&gt;) and
   up to two EGF-like repeats. </p>
  <p>[1197] Two type-I membrane proteins: Mannose receptor from macrophages. This protein mediates
   the endocytosis of glycoproteins by macrophages in several recognition and uptake processes. Its
   extracellular section consists of a fibronectin type II domain followed by eight tandem repeats
   of the CTL domain. 180 Kd secretory phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2-R). A protein whose structure
   is highly similar to that of the mannose receptor. DEC-205 receptor. This protein is used by
   dendritic cells and thymic epithelial cells to capture and endocytose diverse
   carbohydrate-binding antigens and direct them to antigen-processing cellular compartiments.
   DEC-205 extracellular section consists of a fibronectin type II domain followed by ten tandem
   repeats of the CTL domain. Silk moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a
   self-defence mechanism. It is composed of 2 FA58C domains (see &lt;PDOC00988&gt;), a CTL domain,
   2 VWFC domains (see &lt;PDOC00928), and a CTCK (see &lt;PDOC00912&gt;). </p>
  <p>[1198] Various other proteins that uniquely consist of a CTL domain: Invertebrate soluble
   galactose-binding lectins. A category to which belong a humoral lectin from a flesh fly;
   echinoidin, a lectin from the coelomic fluid of a sea urchin; BRA-2 and BRA-3, two lectins from
   the coelomic fluid of a barnacle, a lectin from the tunicate Polyandrocarpa misakiensis and a
   newt oviduct lectin. The physiological importance of these lectins is not yet known but they may
   play an important role in defense mechanisms. Pancreatic stone protein (PSP) (also known as
   pancreatic thread protein (PTP), or reg), a protein that might act as an inhibitor of spontaneous
   calcium carbonate precipitation. Pancreatitis associated protein (PAP), a protein that might be
   involved in the control of bacterial proliferation. Tetranectin, a plasma protein that binds to
   plasminogen and to isolated kringle 4. Eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP), a cytotoxic
   protein. A galactose specific lectin from a rattlesnake. Two subunits of a coagulation factor
   IX/factor X-binding protein (IX/X-bp), a snake venom anticoagulant protein which binds with
   factors IX and X in the presence of calcium. Two subunits of a phospholipase A2 inhibitor from
   the plasma of a snake (PLI-A and PLI-B). A lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LPS-BP) from the
   hemolymph of a cockroach [8]. Sea raven antifreeze protein (AFP) [9]. </p>

   cysteines was selected. Consensus

  <p>[1201] The receptor for the sea urchin egg peptide speract is a transmembrane glycoprotein of
   500 amino acid residues [1]. Structurally it consists of a large extracellular domain of 450
   residues, followed by a transmembrane region and a small cytoplasmic domain of 12 amino acids.
   The extracellular domain contains four repeats of a 115 amino acids domain. There are 17
   positions that are perfectly conserved in the four repeats, among them are six cysteines, six
   glycines, and three glutamates. </p>
  <p>[1202] Such a domain is also found, once, in the C-terminal section of mammalian macrophage
   scavenger receptor type I [2], a membrane glycoproteins implicated in the pathologic deposition

  <p> 768. Chitinases family 18 active site </p>
  <p>[1208] PROSITE cross-reference(s) CHITINASE_18 Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) [1] are enzymes that
   catalyze the hydrolysis of the beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine linkages in chitin polymers. From
   the view point of sequence similarity chitinases belong to either family 18 or 19 in the
   classification of glycosyl hydrolases [2,E1]. Chitinases of family 18 (also known as classes III
   or V) groups a variety of proteins: a) Chitinases from: Prokaryotes such as Alteromonas,
   Bacillus, Serratia, Streptomyces, etc. Plants such as Arabidopsis, cucumber, bean, tobacco, etc.
   Fungi such as Aphanocladium, Rhizopus, Saccharomyces, etc. Nematode (Brugia malayi). Insects
   (Manduca sexta). Baculoviruses (Autographa Californica Nuclear Polyhedrosis virus). b) Other
   proteins: Hevamine, a rubber tree protein with chitinase and lysozyme activities. Kluyveromyces
   lactis killer toxin alpha subunit, which acts as a chitinase. Flavobacterium and Streptomyces
   endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.96). Mammalian di-N-acetylchitobiase which is
   involved in the degradation of asparagine-linked glycoproteins. Human cartilage glycoprotein
   Gp-39. Jack bean concanavalin B (conB), a protein that has lost its catalytic activity. </p>
  <p>[1209] Site directed mutagenesis experiments [3] and crystallographic data [4,5] have shown
   that a conserved glutamate is involved in the catalytic mechanism and probably acts as a proton
   donor. This glutamate is at the extremity of the best conserved region in these proteins.

  <p>[1220] PROSITE cross-reference(s); AA_TRNA_LIGASE_II_1; AA_TRNA_LIGASE_II_2 Aminoacyl-tRNA
   synthetases (EC 6.1.1.-) [1] are a group of enzymes which activate amino acids and transfer them
   to specific tRNA molecules as the first step in protein biosynthesis. In prokaryotic organisms
   there are at least twenty different types of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, one for each different
   amino acid. In eukaryotes there are generally two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for each different
   amino acid: one cytosolic form and a mitochondrial form. While all these enzymes have a common
   function, they are widely diverse in terms of subunit size and of quaternary structure. </p>
  <p>[1221] The synthetases specific for alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine, histidine,
   lysine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, and threonine are referred to as class-II synthetases [2
   to 6] and probably have a common folding pattern in their catalytic domain for the binding of ATP
   and amino acid which is different to the Rossmann fold observed for the class I synthetases [7]. </p>
  <p>[1222] Class-II tRNA synthetases do not share a high degree of similarity, however at least
   three conserved regions are present [2,5,8]. Signature patterns from two of these regions have
   been derived. Consensus pattern[FYH]-R-x-[DE]-x(4,12)-[RH]-x(3)-F-x(3)-[DE] Consensus

  <p>[1227] It has been shown [1,2,3,E1] that the following glycosyl hydrolases can be, on the basis
   of sequence similarities, classified into a single family: Lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (EC
   3.2.1.20) (acid maltase) is a vertebrate glycosidase active at low pH, which hydrolyzes
   alpha(1-&gt;4) and alpha(1-&gt;6) linkages in glycogen, maltose, and isomaltose.

  <p>[1229] Urease (EC 3.5.1.5) is a nickel-binding enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to

   1926). It is mainly found in plant seeds, microorganisms and invertebrates. In plants, urease is
   a hexamer of identical chains. In bacteria [2], it consists of either two or three different
   subunits (alpha, beta and gamma). </p>
  <p>[1230] Urease binds two nickel ions per subunit; four histidine, an aspartate and a

  <p> 779. Tyrosine specific protein phosphatases signature and profiles </p>
  <p>[1232] Tyrosine specific protein phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.48) (PTPase) [1 to 5] are enzymes that
   catalyze the removal of a phosphate group attached to a tyrosine residue. These enzymes are very
   important in the control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and transformation.
   Multiple forms of PTPase have been characterized and can be classified into two categories:
   soluble PTPases and transmembrane receptor proteins that contain PTPase domain(s). The currently
   known PTPases are listed below: </p>
  <p> Soluble PTPases. </p>
  <p> PTPN1 (PTP-1B). PTPN2 (T-cell PTPase; TC-PTP). PTPN3 (H1) and PTPN4 (MEG), enzymes that
   contain an N-terminal band 4.1- like domain (see &lt;PDOC00566&gt;) and could act at junctions
   between the membrane and cytoskeleton. PTPN5 (STEP). PTPN6 (PTP-1C; HCP; SHP) and PTPN11 (PTP-2C;
   SH-PTP3; Syp), enzymes which contain two copies of the SH2 domain at its N-terminal extremity.
   The Drosophila protein corkscrew (gene csw) also belongs to this subgroup. PTPN7 (LC-PTP;
   Hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase; HePTP). PTPN8 (70Z-PEP). PTPN9 (MEG2). PTPN12
   (PTP-G1; PTP-P19). Yeast PTP1. Yeast PTP2 which may be involved in the ubiquitin-mediated protein
   degradation pathway. Fission yeast pyp 1 and pyp2 which play a role in inhibiting the onset of
   mitosis. Fission yeast pyp3 which contributes to the dephosphorylation of cdc2. Yeast CDC14 which
   may be involved in chromosome segregation. Yersinia virulence plasmid PTPAses (gene yopH).

  <p> Dual specificity PTPases. </p>
  <p> DUSP1 (PTPN10; MAP kinase phosphatase-1; MKP-1); which dephosphorylates MAP kinase on both
   Thr-183 and Tyr-185. DUSP2 (PAC-1), a nuclear enzyme that dephosphorylates MAP kinases ERK1 and
   ERK2 on both Thr and Tyr residues. DUSP3 (VHR). DUSP4 (HVH2). DUSPS (HVH3). DUSP6 (Pyst1 ;
   MKP-3). DUSP7 (Pyst2; MKP-X). Yeast MSG5, a PTPase that dephosphorylates MAP kinase FUS3. Yeast
   YVH1. Vaccinia virus H1 PTPase; a dual specificity phosphatase. </p>
  <p> Receptor PTPases. </p>
  <p>[1235] Structurally, all known receptor PTPases, are made up of a variable length extracellular
   domain, followed by a transmembrane region and a C-terminal catalytic cytoplasmic domain. Some of
   the receptor PTPases contain fibronectin type III (FN-III) repeats, immunoglobulin-like domains,
   MAM domains or carbonic anhydrase-like domains in their extracellular region. The cytoplasmic
   region generally contains two copies of the PTPAse domain. The first seems to have enzymatic
   activity, while the second is inactive but seems to affect substrate specificity of the first. In
   these domains, the catalytic cysteine is generally conserved but some other, presumably
   important, residues are not. </p>
  <p>[1236] In the following table, the domain structure of known receptor PTPases is shown:

  <p>[1237] PTPase domains consist of about 300 amino acids. There are two conserved cysteines, the
   second one has been shown to be absolutely required for activity. Furthermore, a number of
   conserved residues in its immediate vicinity have also been shown to be important. </p>
  <p>[1238] A signature pattern was derived for PTPase domains centered on the active site cysteine. </p>
  <p>[1239] There are three profiles for PTPases, the first one spans the complete domain and is not
   specific to any subtype. The second profile is specific to dual-specificity PTPases and the third
   one to the PTP subfamily. Consensus pattern [LIVMF]-H-C-x(2)-G-x(3)-[STC]-[STAGP]-x-[LIVMFY] [C
   is the active site residue] Note the M-phase inducer phosphatases (cdc25-type phosphatase) are
   tyrosine- protein phosphatases that are not structurally related to the above PTPases. Note this
   documentation entry is linked to both a signature pattern and to profiles. As profiles are much
   more sensitive than the pattern, you should use them if you have access to the necessary software
   tools to do so. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Fischer E.H., Charbonneau H., Tonks N.K. Science 253:401-406(1991)</ref>. [ 2]

  <p> 780. Connexins signatures </p>
  <p>[1240] Gap junctions [1] are specialized regions of the plasma membrane which consist of
   closely packed pairs of transmembrane channels, the connexons, through which small molecules
   diffuse from a cell to a neighboring cell. Each connexon is composed of an hexamer of an integral
   membrane protein which is often referred to as connexin. In a given species there are a number of
   different, yet structurally related, tissue specific, forms of connexins. The types of connexins
   which are currently known are listed below. Connexin 56 (Cx56). Connexin 50 (Cx50) (lens fiber
   protein MP70). Connexin 46 (Cx46) (alpha-3). Connexin 45 (Cx45) (alpha-6). Connexin 43 (Cx43)
   (alpha-1). Connexin 40 (Cx40) (alpha-5). Connexin 38 (Cx38) (alpha-2). Connexin 37 (Cx37)
   (alpha-4). Connexin 33 (Cx33) (alpha-7). Connexin 32 (Cx32) (beta-1). Connexin 31.1 (Cx31.1)
   (beta-4). Connexin 31 (Cx31) (beta-3). Connexin 30.3 (Cx30.3) (beta-5). Connexin 26 (Cx26)
   (beta-2). </p>
  <p>[1241] Structurally the connexins consist of a short cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, followed by
   four transmembrane segments that delimit two extracellular and one cytoplasmic loops; the
   C-terminal domain is cytoplasmic and its length is variable (from 20 residues in Cx26 to 260
   residues in Cx56). The schematic representation of this structure is shown below. EMI625.1 </p>
  <p>[1242] The sequences of the two extracellular loops are well conserved. In both loops there are
   three conserved cysteines which are involved in disulfide bonds. A signature patterns from each
   of these two loop regions has been built. Consensus patternC-[DN]-T-x-Q-P-G-C-x(2)-V-C-[FY]-D

  <p>[1243] Surface proteins from Gram-positive cocci contains a conserved hexapeptide located a few
   residues downstream of a hydrophobic C-terminal membrane anchor region which is followed by a
   cluster of basic amino acids [1]. This structure is represented in the following schematic
   representation: EMI625.2 EMI626.1 </p>
  <p>[1244] It has been proposed that this hexapeptide sequence is responsible for a
   post-translational modification necessary for the proper anchoring of the proteins which bear it,
   to the cell wall. Proteins known to contain such hexapeptide are listed below: Aggregation

  <p> 782. Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase signature </p>
  <p>[1245] Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2) (GGT) [1] catalyzes the transfer of the
   gamma-glutamyl moiety of glutathione to an acceptor that may be an amino acid, a peptide or water
   (forming glutamate). GGT plays a key role in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, a pathway for the
   synthesis and degradation of glutathione. In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, it is an enzyme that
   consists of two polypeptide chains, a heavy and a light subunit, processed from a single chain
   precursor. The active site of GGT is known to be located in the light subunit. </p>
  <p>[1246] The sequences of mammalian and bacterial GGT show a number of regions of high similarity
   [2]. Pseudomonas cephalosporin acylases (EC 3.5.1.-) that convert
   7-beta-(4-carboxybutanamido)-cephalosporanic acid (GL-7ACA) into 7-aminocephalosporanic acid
   (7ACA) and glutaric acid are evolutionary related to GGT and also show some GGT activity [3].
   Like GGT, these GL-7ACA acylases, are also composed of two subunits. </p>
  <p>[1247] One of the conserved regions correspond to the N-terminal extremity of the mature light
   chains of these enzymes. This region has been used as a signature pattern. Consensus

   heme biosynthesis: the chelation of a ferrous ion to proto-porphyrin IX, to form protoheme. </p>
  <p>[1249] In eukaryotes, ferrochelatase is a mitochondrial protein bound to the inner membrane,
   whose active site faces the mitochondrial matrix. The mature form of eukaryotic ferrochelatase is
   composed of about 360 amino acids. In bacteria, ferrochelatase (gene hemH) [3] is a protein of
   from 310 to 380 amino acids. </p>
  <p>[1250] The human autosomal dominant disease protoporphyria is due to the reduced activity of
   ferrochelatase. </p>

  <p>[1252] The microbial degradation of cellulose and xylans requires several types of enzyme such

   acid residues [2]. Enzymes known to contain such a domain are: Endoglucanase (gene endl) from

  <p>[1256] It has been shown [1,2,3] that several enzymes from various prokaryotic and eukaryotic
   organisms which are involved in the hydrolysis of amides (amidases) are evolutionary related.
   These enzymes are listed below. Indoleacetamide hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.-), a bacterial

  <p> 786. Glycosyl hydrolases family 10 active site </p>
  <p>[1258] The microbial degradation of cellulose and xylans requires several types of enzymes such
   as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4), cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91) (exoglucanases), or xylanases
   (EC 3.2.1.8) [1,2]. Fungi and bacteria produces a spectrum of cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases)
   and xylanases which, on the basis of sequence similarities, can be classified into families. One
   of these families is known as the cellulase family F [3] or as the glycosyl hydrolases family 10
   [4,E1]. The enzymes which are currently known to belong to this family are listed below.
   Aspergillus awamori xylanase A (xynA). Bacillus sp. strain 125 xylanase (xynA). Bacillus
   stearothermophilus xylanase. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens xylanases A (xynA) and B (xynB).
   Caldocellum saccharolyticum bifunctional endoglucanase/exoglucanase (celB). This protein consists
   of two domains; it is the N-terminal domain, which has exoglucanase activity, which belongs to
   this family. Caldocellum saccharolyticum xylanase A (xynA). Caldocellum saccharolyticum ORF4.
   This hypothetical protein is encoded in the xynABC operon and is probably a xylanase.
   Cellulomonas fimi exoglucanase/xylanase (cex). Clostridium stercorarium thermostable
   celloxylanase. Clostridium thermocellum xylanases Y (xynY) and Z (xynZ). Cryptococcus albidus
   xylanase. Penicillium chrysogenum xylanase (gene xylP). Pseudomonas fluorescens xylanases A
   (xynA) and B (xynB). Ruminococcus flavefaciens bifunctional xylanase XYLA (xynA). This protein
   consists of three domains: a N-terminal xylanase catalytic domain that belongs to family 11 of
   glycosyl hydrolases; a central domain composed of short repeats of Gln, Asn an Trp, and a
   C-terminal xylanase catalytic domain that belongs to family 10 of glycosyl hydrolases.
   Streptomyces lividans xylanase A (xlnA). Thermoanaerobacter saccharolyticum endoxylanase A
   (xynA). Thermoascus aurantiacus xylanase. Thermophilic bacterium Rt8.B4 xylanase (xynA). </p>
  <p>[1259] One of the conserved regions in these enzymes is centered on a conserved glutamic acid
   residue which has been shown [5], in the exoglucanase from Cellulomonas fimi, to be directly
   involved in glycosidic bond cleavage by acting as a nucleophile. This region has been used as a
   signature pattern. Consensus pattern[GTA]-x(2)-[LIVN]-x-[IVMF]-[ST]-E-[LIY]-[DN]-[LIVMF] [E is

  <p> 787. Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase class-II signatures </p>
  <p>[1260] Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) [1,2] is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
   the reversible aldol cleavage or condensation of fructose-1,6- bisphosphate into
   dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. There are two classes of
   fructose-bisphosphate aldolases with different catalytic mechanisms. Class-II aldolases [2],
   mainly found in prokaryotes and fungi, are homodimeric enzymes which require a divalent metal ion
   - generally zinc - for their activity. </p>
  <p>[1261] This family also includes the following proteins: Escherichia coli galactitol operon
   protein gatY which catalyzes the transformation of tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate into glycerone
   phosphate and D- glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Escherichia coli N-acetyl galactosamine operon
   protein agaY which catalyzes the same reaction as that of gatY. </p>
  <p>[1262] As signature patterns for this class of enzyme, two conserved regions were selected. The
   first pattern is located in the first half of the sequence and contains two histidine residues
   that have been shown [4] to be involved in binding a zinc ion. The second is located in the
   C-terminal section and contains clustered acidic residues and glycines. Consensus

  <p> 788. Prolyl oligopeptidase family serine active site </p>
  <p>[1263] The prolyl oligopeptidase family [1,2,3] consist of a number of evolutionary related
   peptidases whose catalytic activity seems to be provided by a charge relay system similar to that
   of the trypsin family of serine proteases, but which evolved by independent convergent evolution.
   The known members of this family are listed below. Prolyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26) (PE) (also
   called post-proline cleaving enzyme). PE is an enzyme that cleaves peptide bonds on the
   C-terminal side of prolyl residues. The sequence of PE has been obtained from a mammalian species
   (pig) and from bacteria (Flavobacterium meningosepticum and Aeromonas hydrophila); there is a
   high degree of sequence conservation between these sequences. Escherichia coli protease II (EC
   3.4.21.83) (oligopeptidase B) (gene prtB) which cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of
   lysyl and argininyl residues. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5) (DPP IV). DPP IV is an enzyme
   that removes N-terminal dipeptides sequentially from polypeptides having unsubstituted N-termini
   provided that the penultimate residue is proline. Yeast vacuolar dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A
   (DPAP A) (gene: STE13) which is responsible for the proteolytic maturation of the alpha-factor
   precursor. Yeast vacuolar dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAP B) (gene: DAP2).
   Acylamino-acid-releasing enzyme (EC 3.4.19.1) (acyl-peptide hydrolase). This enzyme catalyzes the
   hydrolysis of the amino-terminal peptide bond of an N-acetylated protein to generate a
   N-acetylated amino acid and a protein with a free amino-terminus. </p>
  <p>[1264] A conserved serine residue has experimentally been shown (in E.coli protease II as well
   as in pig and bacterial PE) to be necessary for the catalytic mechanism. This serine, which is
   part of the catalytic triad (Ser, His, Asp), is generally located about 150 residues away from
   the C-terminal extremity of these enzymes (which are all proteins that contains about 700 to 800
   amino acids). Consensus patternD-x(3)-A-x(3)-[LIVMFYW]-x(14)-G-x-S-x-G-G-[LIVMFYW](2) [S is the

  <p> 789. Formate--tetrahydrofolate ligase signatures </p>
  <p>[1265] Formate--tetrahydrofolate ligase (EC 6.3.4.3) (formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase)
   (FTHFS) is one of the enzymes participating in the transfer of one-carbon units, an essential
   element of various biosynthetic pathways. In many of these processes the transfers of one-carbon
   units are mediated by the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate (THF). Various reactions generate one-carbon
   derivatives of THF which can be interconverted between different oxidation states by FTHFS,
   methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.5) and methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase
   (EC 3.5.4.9). </p>
  <p>[1266] In eukaryotes the FTHFS activity is expressed by a multifunctional enzyme,
   C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase (C1-THF synthase), which also catalyzes the dehydrogenase and
   cyclohydrolase activities. Two forms of C1-THF synthases are known [1], one is located in the
   mitochondrial matrix, while the second one is cytoplasmic. In both forms the FTHFS domain consist
   of about 600 amino acid residues and is located in the C-terminal section of C1-THF synthase. In
   prokaryotes FTHFS activity is expressed by a monofunctional homotetrameric enzyme of about 560
   amino acid residues [2]. </p>
  <p>[1267] The sequence of FTHFS is highly conserved in all forms of the enzyme. As signature
   patterns, two regions that are almost perfectly conserved were selected. The first one is a
   glycine-rich segment located in the N-terminal part of FTHFS and which could be part of an
   ATP-binding domain [2]. The second pattern is located in the central section of FTHFS. Consensus

  <p>[1268] Transthyretin (prealbumin) [1] is a thyroid hormone-binding protein that seems to
   transport thyroxine (T4) from the bloodstream to the brain. It is a protein of about 130 amino
   acids that assembles as a homotetramer and forms an internal channel that binds thyroxine.
   Transthyretin is mainly synthesized in the brain choroid plexus. In humans, variants of the
   protein are associated with distinct forms of amyloidosis. </p>
  <p>[1269] The sequence of transthyretin is highly conserved in vertebrates. A number of
   uncharacterized proteins also belong to this family: Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yedX.

  <p> 791. Dihydropteroate synthase signatures </p>
  <p>*[1271] All organisms require reduced folate cofactors for the synthesis of a variety of
   metabolites. Most microorganisms must synthesize folate de novo because they lack the active
   transport system of higher vertebrate cells which allows these organisms to use dietary folates.
   Enzymes that are involved in the biosynthesis of folates are therefore the target of a variety of
   antimicrobial agents such as trimethoprim or sulfonamides. </p>
  <p>[1272] Dihydropteroate synthase (EC 2.5.1.15) (DHPS) catalyzes the condensation of
   6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine pyrophosphate to para-aminobenzoic acid to form
   7,8-dihydropteroate. This is the second step in the three steps pathway leading from
   6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin to 7,8-dihydrofolate. DHPS is the target of sulfonamides which
   are substrates analog that compete with para-aminobenzoic acid. </p>
  <p>[1273] Bacterial DHPS (gene sul or folP) [1] is a protein of about 275 to 315 amino acid
   residues which is either chromosomally encoded or found on various antibiotic resistance
   plasmids. In the lower eukaryote Pneumocystis carinii, DHPS is the C-terminal domain of a
   multifunctional folate synthesis enzyme (gene fas) [2]. </p>
  <p>[1274] Two signature patterns for DHPS were developed, the first signature is located in the

  <p> 792. Phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinases signatures </p>
  <p>[1275] Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) (EC 2.7.1.137) [1] is an enzyme that
   phosphorylates phosphoinositides on the 3-hydroxyl group of the inositol ring. The exact function
   of the three products of PI3-kinase - PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P(2) and PI-3,4,5-P(3) - is not yet known,
   although it is proposed that they function as second messengers in cell signalling. Currently,
   three forms of PI3-kinase are known: The mammalian enzyme which is a heterodimer of a 110 Kd
   catalytic chain (p110) and an 85 Kd subunit (p85) which allows it to bind to activated tyrosine
   protein kinases. There are at least two different types of p100 subunits (alpha and beta). Yeast
   TOR1/DRR1 and TOR2/DRR2 [2], PI3-kinases required for cell cycle activation. Both are proteins of
   about 280 Kd. Yeast VPS34 [3], a PI3-kinase involved in vacuolar sorting and segregation. VPS34
   is a protein of about 100 Kd. Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean VPS34 homologs. </p>
  <p>[1276] Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4-kinase) (EC 2.7.1.67) [4] is an enzyme that acts on
   phosphatidylinositol (PI) in the first committed step in the production of the second messenger
   inositol-1,4,5,-trisphosphate. Currently the following forms of PI4-kinases are known: Human
   PI4-kinase alpha. Yeast PIK1, a nuclear protein of 120 Kd. Yeast STT4, a protein of 214 Kd. </p>
  <p>[1277] The PI3- and PI4-kinases share a well conserved domain at their C-terminal section; this
   domain seems to be distantly related to the catalytic domain of protein kinases [2]. Two
   signature patterns were developed from the best conserved parts of this domain. </p>
  <p>[1278] Four additional proteins belong to this family: Mammalian FKBP-rapamycin associated
   protein (FRAP) [5], which acts as the target for the cell-cycle arrest and immunosuppressive
   effects of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. Yeast protein ESR1 [6] which is required for cell
   growth, DNA repair and meiotic recombination. Yeast protein TEL1 which is involved in controlling

  <p> 793. FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signatures </p>
  <p>[1279] FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5) (GPD) catalyzes the
   conversion of glycerol-3 -phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate. In bacteria [1] it is
   associated with the utilization of glycerol coupled to respiration. In Escherichia coli, two
   isozymes are known: one expressed under anaerobic conditions (gene glpA) and one in aerobic
   conditions (gene glpD). In eukaryotes, a mitochondrial form of GPD participates in the glycerol
   phosphate shuttle in conjunction with an NAD-dependent cytoplasmic GPD (EC 1.1.1.8) [2,3]. </p>
  <p>[1280] These enzymes are proteins of about 60 to 70 Kd which contain a probable FAD-binding
   domain in their N-terminal extremity. The mammalian enzyme differs from the bacterial or yeast
   proteins by having an EF-hand calcium-binding region (See &lt;PDOC00018&gt;) in its C-terminal
   extremity. </p>
  <p>[1281] Two signature patterns were developed. One based on the first half of the FAD-binding
   domain and one which corresponds to a conserved region in the central part of these enzymes.

  <p> 795. moaA / nifB / pqqE family signature </p>
  <p>[1284] A number of proteins involved in the biosynthesis of metallo cofactors have been shown
   [1,2] to be evolutionary related. These proteins are: Bacterial and archebacterial protein moaA,
   which is involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (molybdopterin; MPT).
   Arabidopsis thaliana cnx2, a protein involved in molybdopterin biosynthesis and which is highlys
   similar to moaA. Bacillus subtilis narA, which seems to be the moaA ortholog in that bacteria.
   Bacterial protein nifB (or fixZ) which is involved in the biosynthesis of the nitrogenase
   iron-molybdenum cofactor. Bacterial protein pqqE which is involved in the biosynthesis of the
   cofactor pyrrolo-quinoline-quinone (PQQ). Pyrococcus furiosus cmo, a protein involved in the
   synthesis of a molybdopterin-based tungsten cofactor. Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein
   F49E2.1. </p>
  <p>[1285] All these proteins share, in their N-terminal region, a conserved domain that contains
   three cysteines. In moaA, these cysteines have been shown [1] to be important for the biological
   activity. They could be inolved in the binding of an iron-sulfur cluster. Consensus

  <p> 796. Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain profile </p>
  <p>[1286] The forkhead-associated (FHA) domain [1,E1] is a putative nuclear signalling domain
   found in a variety of otherwise unrelated proteins. The FHA domain comprise approximately 55 to
   75 amino acids and contains three highly conserved blocks separated by divergent spacer regions.
   Currently it has been found in the following proteins: Four transcription factors that also
   contain a forkhead (FH) domain: mouse myocyte nuclear factor 1 (MNF1), yeast transcription factor
   FHL1, which probably controls pre-mRNA processing, and yeast FKH1 and FKH2. In those protein the
   FHA domain is located N-terminal of the DNA-binding FH domain. Kinase-associated protein
   phosphatase (KAPP) from Arabidopsis thaliana, a protein which specifically interacts with the
   receptor-type Ser/Thr-kinase RLK5. In KAPP, the FHA domain maps to a region that interacts with
   the receptor-type protein kinase RLK5 only if the kinase is phosphorylated on serine residues
   [2]. Two protein kinases from yeast that are involved in mediating the nuclear response to DNA
   damage: DUN1 and SPK1/SAD1 [3]. The latter is the only known protein containing two copies of the
   FHA domain. Protein kinase cds1 from fission yeast contains a FHA domain and might be the
   ortholog of SPK1. Protein kinase MEK1 from yeast, which is involved in meiotic recombination.
   Human nuclear antigen Ki67 which is expressed only in proliferating cells. Yeast hypothetical
   protein YHR115c, which contains a RING-finger C-terminal of the FHA domain. Yeast hypothetical
   proteins L8083.1 and 9346.10, which contain an extensive coiled-coil region C-terminal of the FHA
   domain. Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK632.2. Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical
   protein C01G6.5. FraH from the prokaryote Anabaena, which contains a zinc-finger motif N-terminal
   of the FHA domain. An ORF from the bacterium Streptomyces, which is on the opposite strand of the

  <p>[1297] The bromodomain [1,2,3] is a conserved region of about 70 amino acids found in the
   following proteins: Higher eukaryotes transcription initiation factor TFIID 250 Kd subunit
   (TBP-associated factor p250) (gene CCG1). P250 associated with the TFIID TATA-box binding protein
   and seems essential for progression of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Human RING3, a protein of
   unknown function encoded in the MHC class II locus. Mammalian CREB-binding protein (CBP), which
   mediates cAMP-gene regulation by binding specifically to phosphorylated CREB protein. Drosophila
   female sterile homeotic protein (gene fsh), required maternally for proper expression of other
   homeotic genes involved in pattern formation, such as Ubx. Drosophila brahma protein (gene brm),
   a protein required for the activation of multiple homeotic genes. Mammalian homologs of brahma.
   In human, three brahma-like proteins are known: SNF2a(hBRM), SNF2b, and BRG1. Human BS69, a
   protein that binds to adenovirus E1A and inhibits E1A transactivation Human peregrin (or Br140).
   Yeast BDF1 [3], a transcription factor involved in the expression of a broad class of genes
   including snRNAs. Yeast GCN5, a general transcriptional activator operating in concert with
   certain other DNA-binding transcriptional activators, such as GCN4, HAP2/3/4 or ADA2. Yeast
   NPS1/STH1, involved in G(2) phase control in mitosis. Yeast SNF2/SWI2, which is part of a complex
   with the SNF5, SNF6, SWI3 and ADR6/SWI1 proteins. This SWI-complex is involved in transcriptional
   activation. Yeast SPT7, a transcriptional activator of Ty elements and possibly other genes.
   Caenorhabditis elegans protein cbp-1. Yeast hypothetical protein YGR056w. Yeast hypothetical
   protein YKR008w. Yeast hypothetical protein L9638.1. </p>
  <p>[1298] Some proteins contain a region which, while similar to some extent to a classical
   bromodomain, diverges from it by either lacking part of the domain or because of an insertion.
   These proteins are: Mammalian protein HRX (also known as All-1 or MLL), a protein involved in
   translocations leading to acute leukemias and which possibly acts as a transcriptional regulatory
   factor. HRX contains a region similar to the C- terminal half of the bromodomain. Caenorhabditis
   elegans hypothetical protein ZK783.4. The bromodomain of this protein has a 23 amino-acid
   insertion. Yeast protein YTA7. This protein contains a region with significant similarity to the
   C-terminal half of the bromodomain. As it is a member of the AAA family (see &lt;PDOC00572&gt;)
   it is also in a functionally different context. </p>
  <p>[1299] The above proteins generally contain a single bromodomain, but some of them contain two
   copies, this is the case of BDF1, CCG1, fsh, RING3, YKR008w and L9638.1. </p>
  <p>[1300] The exact function of this domain is not yet known but it is thought to be involved in
   protein-protein interactions and it may be important for the assembly or activity of
   multicomponent complexes involved in transcriptional activation. </p>
  <p>[1301] The consensus pattern that has been developed spans a major part of the bromodomain; a
   more sensitive detection is available through the use of a profile which spans the whole domain.

  <p>[1303] Alpha-actinin is a F-actin cross-linking protein which is thought to anchoractin to a
   variety of intracellular structures [1]. The actin-binding domain of alpha-actinin seems to
   reside in the first 250 residues of the protein. A similar actin-binding domain has been found in
   the N-terminal region of many different actin-binding proteins [2,3]: In the beta chain of
   spectrin (or fodrin). In dystrophin, the protein defective in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
   and which may play a role in anchoring the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. In the slime mold
   gelation factor (or ABP-120). In actin-binding protein ABP-280 (or filamin), a protein that link
   actin filaments to membrane glycoproteins. In fimbrin (or plastin), an actin-bundling protein.
   Fimbrin differs from the above proteins in that it contains two tandem copies of the
   actin-binding domain and that these copies are located in the C-terminal part of the protein. </p>
  <p>[1304] Two conserved regions were selected as signature patterns for this type of main. The
   first of this region is located at the beginning of the domain, hile the second one is located in

  <p> 809. (COX1) Heme-copper oxidase subunit I, copper B binding region signature </p>
  <p> PROSITE cross-reference(s): PS00077; COX1 </p>
  <p>[1305] Heme-copper respiratory oxidases [1] are oligomeric integral membrane protein complexes
   that catalyze the terminal step in the respiratory chain: they transfer electrons from cytochrome
   c or a quinol to oxygen. Some terminal oxidases generate a transmembrane proton gradient across
   the plasma membrane (prokaryotes) or the mitochondrial inner membrane (eukaryotes). The enzyme
   complex consists of 3-4 subunits (prokaryotes) up to 13 polypeptides (mammals) of which only the
   catalytic subunit (equivalent to mammalian subunit I (CO I)) is found in all heme-copper
   respiratory oxidases. The presence of a bimetallic center (formed by a high-spin heme and copper
   B) as well as a low-spin heme, both ligated to six conserved histidine residues near the outer
   side of four transmembrane spans within CO I is common to all family members [2-4]. </p>
  <p>[1306] In contrary to eukaryotes the respiratory chain of prokaryotes is branched to multiple
   terminal oxidases. The enzyme complexes vary in heme and copper composition, substrate type and
   substrate affinity. The different respiratory oxidases allow the cells to customize their
   respiratory systems according a variety of environmental growth conditions [1]. </p>
  <p>[1307] Recently also a component of an anaerobic respiratory chain has been found to contain
   the copper B binding signature of this family: nitric oxide reductase (NOR) exists in
   denitrifying species of Archae and Eubacteria. </p>
  <p>[1308] Enzymes that belong to this family are: Mitochondrial-type cytochrome c oxidase (EC
   1.9.3.1) which uses cytochrome c as electron donor. The electrons are transferred via copper A
   (Cu(A)) and heme a to the bimetallic center of CO I that is formed by a penta-coordinated heme a
   and copper B (Cu(B)). Subunit 1 contains 12 transmembrane regions. Cu(B) is said to be ligated to
   three of the conserved histidine residues within the transmembrane segments 6 and 7. Quinol
   oxidase from prokaryotes that transfers electrons from a quinol to the binuclear center of
   polypeptide I. This category of enzymes includes Escherichia coli cytochrome O terminal oxidase
   complex which is a component of the aerobic respiratory chain that predominates when cells are
   grown at high aeration. FixN, the catalytic subunit of a cytochrome c oxidase expressed in
   nitrogen-fixing bacteroids living in root nodules. The high affinity for oxygen allows oxidative
   phosphorylation under low oxygen concentrations. A similar enzyme has been found in other purple
   bacteria. Nitric oxide reductase (EC 1.7.99.7) from Pseudomonas stutzeri. NOR reduces nitrate to
   dinitrogen. It is a heterodimer of norC and the catalytic subunit norB. The latter contains the 6
   invariant histidine residues and 12 transmembrane segments [5]. </p>

  <p> PROSITE cross-reference(s): PS00559; MOLYBDOPTERIN_EUK </p>
  <p>[1310] A number of different eukaryotic oxidoreductases that require and bind a molybdopterin
   cofactor have been shown [1] to share a few regions of sequence similarity. These enzymes are:
   Xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.204), which catalyzes the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid
   with the concomitant reduction of NAD. Structurally, this enzyme of about 1300 amino acids
   consists of at least three distinct domains: an N-terminal 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-like iron-sulfur
   binding domain (see &lt;PDOC00175&gt;), a central FAD/NAD-binding domain and a C-terminal
   Mo-pterin domain. Aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1), which catalyzes the oxidation aldehydes into
   acids. Aldehyde oxidase is highly similar to xanthine dehydrogenase in its sequence and domain
   structure. Nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1), which catalyzes the reduction of nitrate to nitrite.
   Structurally, this enzyme of about 900 amino acids consists of an N-terminal Mo-pterin domain, a
   central cytochrome b5-type heme-binding domain (see &lt;PDOC00170&gt;) and a C-terminal
   FAD/NAD-binding cytochrome reductase domain. Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1), which catalyzes the
   oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. Structurally, this enzyme of about 460 amino acids consists of
   an N-terminal cytochrome b5-binding domain followed by a Mo-pterin domain. </p>
  <p>[1311] There are a few conserved regions in the sequence of the molybdopterin-binding domain of
   these enzymes. The pattern uses to detect these proteins is based on one of them. It contains a
   cysteine residue which could be involved in binding the molybdopterin cofactor. Consensus

  <p>[1312] DNA ligase (polydeoxyribonucleotide synthase) is the enzyme that joins two DNA fragments
   by catalyzing the formation of an internucleotide ester bond between phosphate and deoxyribose.
   It is active during DNA replication, DNA repair and DNA recombination. There are two forms of DNA
   ligase: one requires ATP (EC 6.5.1.1), the other NAD (EC 6.5.1.2). </p>
  <p>[1313] Eukaryotic, archaebacterial, virus and phage DNA ligases are ATP-dependent. During the
   first step of the joining reaction, the ligase interacts with ATP to form a covalent
   enzyme-adenylate intermediate. A conserved lysine residue is the site of adenylation [1,2]. </p>

  <p>[1316] FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5) (GPD) catalyzes the

   associated with the utilization of glycerol coupled to respiration. In Escherichia coli, two
   isozymes are known: one expressed under anaerobic conditions (gene glpA) and one in aerobic

  <p> [1321] Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2) (GGT) [1] catalyzes the transfer of the
   gamma-glutamyl moiety of glutathione to an acceptor that may be an amino acid, a peptide or water
   (forming glutamate). GGT plays a key role in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, a pathway for the
   synthesis and degradation of glutathione. In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, it is an enzyme that
   consists of two polypeptide chains, a heavy and a light subunit, processed from a single chain
   precursor. The active site of GGT is known to be located in the light subunit. </p>
  <p>[1322] The sequences of mammalian and bacterial GGT show a number of regions of high similarity

  <p>[1324] Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) [1] act as intermediaries in the
   transduction of signals generated by transmembrane receptors. G proteins consist of three
   subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma). The alpha subunit binds to and hydrolyzes GTP; the functions
   of the beta and gamma subunits are less clear but they seem to be required for the replacement of
   GDP by GTP as well as for membrane anchoring and receptor recognition. </p>
  <p>[1325] The gamma subunits are small proteins (from 70 to 110 residues) that are bound to the
   membrane via a isoprenyl group (either a farnesyl or a geranylgeranyl) covalently linked to their
   C-terminus. In mammals there are at least 12 different isoforms of gamma subunits. </p>
  <p>[1326] The Caenorhabditis elegans protein egl-10, which is a regulator of G-protein signalling,

  <p>[1330] The basic structure of immunoglobulin (Ig) [1] molecules is a tetramer of two light
   chains and two heavy chains linked by disulfide bonds. There are two types of light chains: kappa
   and lambda, each composed of a constant domain (CL) and a variable domain (VL). There are five
   types of heavy chains: alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma and mu, all consisting of a variable domain
   (VH) and three (in alpha, delta and gamma) or four (in epsilon and mu) constant domains (CH1 to
   CH4). </p>
  <p>[1331] The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are made of two chains. In class I
   [2] the alpha chain is composed of three extracellular domains, a transmembrane region and a

   domain. In class II [3], both the alpha and the beta chains are composed of two extracellular
   domains, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail. </p>
  <p>[1332] It is known [4,5] that the Ig constant chain domains and a single extracellular domain
   in each type of MHC chains are related. These homologous domains are approximately one hundred

  <p> 820. (myosin_head) ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop) </p>
  <p> PROSITE cross-reference(s): PS00017; ATP_GTP_A </p>
  <p>[1337] From sequence comparisons and crystallographic data analysis it has been shown
   [1,2,3,4,5,6] that an appreciable proportion of proteins that bind ATP or GTP share a number of
   more or less conserved sequence motifs. The best conserved of these motifs is a glycine-rich
   region, which typically forms a flexible loop between a beta-strand and an alpha-helix. This loop
   interacts with one of the phosphate groups of the nucleotide. This sequence motif is generally
   referred to as the 'A' consensus sequence [ Ii or the 'P-loop' [5]. </p>
  <p>[1338] There are numerous ATP- or GTP-binding proteins in which the P-loop is found. A number
   of protein families for which the relevance of the presence of such motif has been noted is
   listed below: ATP synthase alpha and beta subunits (see &lt;PDOC00137&gt;). Myosin heavy chains.
   Kinesin heavy chains and kinesin-like proteins (see &lt;PDOC00343&gt;). Dynamins and dynamin-like
   proteins (see &lt;PDOC00362&gt;). Guanylate kinase (see &lt;PDOC00670&gt;). Thymidine kinase (see
   &lt;PDOC00524&gt;). Thymidylate kinase (see &lt;PDOC01034&gt;). Shikimate kinase (see
   &lt;PDOC00868&gt;). Nitrogenase iron protein family (nifH/frxC) (see &lt;PDOC00580&gt;).
   ATP-binding proteins involved in 'active transport' (ABC transporters) [7] (see
   &lt;PDOC00185&gt;). DNA and RNA helicases [8,9,10]. GTP-binding elongation factors (EF-Tu,
   EF-1alpha, EF-G, EF-2, etc.). Ras family of GTP-binding proteins (Ras, Rho, Rab, Ral, Ypt1, SEC4,
   etc.). Nuclear protein ran (see &lt;PDOC00859&gt;). ADP-ribosylation factors family (see
   &lt;PDOC00781&gt;). Bacterial dnaA protein (see &lt;PDOC00771&gt;). Bacterial recA protein (see
   &lt;PDOC00131&gt;). Bacterial recF protein (see &lt;PDOC00539&gt;). Guanine nucleotide-binding
   proteins alpha subunits (Gi, Gs, Gt, G0, etc.). DNA mismatch repair proteins mutS family (See
   &lt;PDOC00388&gt;). Bacterial type II secretion system protein E (see &lt;PDOC00567&gt;). </p>
  <p>[1339] Not all ATP- or GTP-binding proteins are picked-up by this motif. A number of proteins
   escape detection because the structure of their ATP-binding site is completely different from
   that of the P-loop. Examples of such proteins are the E1-E2 ATPases or the glycolytic kinases. In
   other ATP- or GTP-binding proteins the flexible loop exists in a slightly different form; this is
   the case for tubulins or protein kinases. A special mention must be reserved for adenylate
   kinase, in which there is a single deviation from the P-loop pattern: in the last position Gly is
   found instead of Ser or Thr. Consensus pattern[AG]-x(4)-G-K-[ST] [ 1] <ref type="npl">Walker J.E., Saraste M.,

  <p>[1341] On the basis of sequence similarities, the following bacterial and eukaryotic proteins
   seem to form a family: Escherichia coli and related bacteria ribonuclease II (EC 3.1.13.1) (RNase
   II) (gene rnb) [1]. RNase II is an exonuclease involved in mRNA decay. It degrades mRNA by
   hydrolyzing single-stranded polyribonucleotides processively in the 3' to 5' direction. Bacterial
   protein vacB. In Shigella flexneri, vacB has been shown to be required for the expression of
   virulence genes at the posttranscriptional level. Yeast protein SSD1 (or SRK1) which is
   implicated in the control of the cell cycle G1 phase. Yeast protein DIS3 [2], which binds to ran
   (GSP1) and ehances the the nucleotide-releasing activity of RCC1 on ran. Fission yeast protein
   dis3, which is implicated in mitotic control. Neurospora crassa cyt-4, a mitochondrial protein
   required for RNA 5' and 3' end processing and splicing. Yeast protein MSU1, which is involved in
   mitochondrial biogenesis. Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 protein zam [3], which control resistance
   to the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide. Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein
   F48E8.6. </p>
  <p>[1342] The size of these proteins range from 644 residues (rnb) to 1250 (SSD1). While their
   sequence is highly divergent they share a conserved domain in their C-terminal section [4]. It is
   possible that this domain plays a role in a putative exonuclease function that would be common to
   all these proteins. A signature pattern was developed based on the core of this conserved domain.

  <p>[1343] The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain is a protein domain of about 100 amino-acid residues
   first identified as a conserved sequence region between the oncoproteins Src and Fps [1]. Similar
   sequences were later found in many other intracellular signal-transducing proteins [2]. SH2
   domains function as regulatory modules of intracellular signalling cascades by interacting with
   high affinity to phosphotyrosine-containing target peptides in a sequence-specific and strictly
   phosphorylation-dependent manner [3,4,5,6]. </p>
  <p>[1344] The SH2 domain has a conserved 3D structure consisting of two alpha helices and six to
   seven beta-strands. The core of the domain is formed by a continuous beta-meander composed of two
   connected beta-sheets [7]. </p>
  <p>[1345] So far, SH2 domains have been identified in the following proteins: Many vertebrate,
   invertebrate and retroviral cytoplasmic (non-receptor) protein tyrosine kinases. In particular in
   the Src, Abl, Bkt, Csk and ZAP70 families of kinases. Mammalian phosphatidylinositol-specific
   phospholipase C gamma-1 and -2. Two copies of the SH2 domain are found in those proteins in
   between the catalytic 'X-' and 'Y-boxes' (see &lt;PDOC50007&gt;). Mammalian phosphatidyl inositol
   3-kinase regulatory p85 subunit. Some vertebrate and invertebrate protein-tyrosine phosphatases.
   Mammalian Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Adaptor proteins mediating binding of guanine
   nucleotide exchange factors to growth factor receptors: vertebrate GRB2, Caenorhabditis elegans
   sem-5 and Drosophila DRK. Mammalian Vav oncoprotein, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor of the
   CDC24 family. Miscellanous proteins interacting with vertebrate receptor protein tyrosine
   kinases: oncoprotein Crk, mammalian cytoplasmic proteins Nck, Shc. STAT proteins (signal
   transducers and activators of transcription). Chicken tensin. Yeast transcriptional control
   protein SPT6. </p>
  <p>[1346] The profile developed to detect SH2 domains is based on a structural alignment
   consisting of 8 gap-free blocks and 7 linker regions totaling 92 match positions. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Sadowski

  <p>[1365] Eukaryotic protein kinases [1 to 5] are enzymes that belong to a very extensive family
   of proteins which share a conserved catalytic core common to both serine/threonine and tyrosine
   protein kinases. There are a number of conserved regions in the catalytic domain of protein
   kinases. Two of these regions have been selected to build signature patterns. The first region,
   which is located in the N-terminal extremity of the catalytic domain, is a glycine-rich stretch
   of residues in the vicinity of a lysine residue, which has been shown to be involved in ATP
   binding. The second region, which is located in the central part of the catalytic domain,
   contains a conserved aspartic acid residue which is important for the catalytic activity of the
   enzyme [6]; two signature patterns were derived for that region: one specific for
   serine/threonine kinases and the other for tyrosine kinases. A profile was developed which is
   based on the alignment in [1] and covers the entire catalytic domain. Consensus pattern:
   [LIV]-G-{P}-G-{P}-[FYWMGSTNH]-[SGA]-{PW}-[LIVCAT]-{PD}-x-[GSTACLIVMFY]-x(5,18)-[LIVMFYWCSTAR]-[AIVP]-[LIVMFAGCKR]-K
   [K binds ATP] </p>
  <p>[1366] Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern the majority of known
   protein kinases but it fails to find a number of them, especially viral kinases which are quite
   divergent in this region and are completely missed by this pattern. Consensus pattern:
   [LIVMFYC]-x-[HY]-x-D-[LIVMFY]-K-x(2)-N-[LIVMFYCT](3) [D is an active site residue] </p>
  <p>[1367] Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern. Most serine/ threonine
   specific protein kinases with 10 exceptions (half of them viral kinases) and also Epstein-Barr
   virus BGLF4 and Drosophila ninaC which have respectively Ser and Arg instead of the conserved Lys
   and which are therefore detected by the tyrosine kinase specific pattern described below. </p>
  <p>[1368] Consensus pattern: [LIVMFYC]-x-[HY]-x-D-[LIVMFY]-[RSTAC]-x(2)-N-[LIVMFYC](3) [D is an
   active site residue] tyrosine specific protein kinases with the exception of human ERBB3 and
   mouse blk. This pattern will also detect most bacterial aminoglycoside phosphotransferases [8,9]
   and herpesviruses ganciclovir kinases [10]; which are proteins structurally and evolutionary
   related to protein kinases. Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile ALL,
   except for three viral kinases. This profile also detects receptor guanylate cyclases (see
   &lt;PDOC00430&gt;) and 2-5A-dependent ribonucleases. Sequence similarities between these two
   families and the eukaryotic protein kinase family have been noticed before. It also detects
   Arabidopsis thaliana kinase- like protein TMKL1 which seems to have lost its catalytic activity. </p>
  <p> [1369] Note if a protein analyzed includes the two protein kinase signatures, the probability
   of it being a protein kinase is close to 100%. Note eukaryotic-type protein kinases have also
   been found in prokaryotes such as Myxococcus xanthus [11] and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Note
   the patterns shown above has been updated since their publication in [7]. Note this documentation
   entry is linked to both signature patterns and a profile. As the profile is much more sensitive
   than the patterns, you should use it if you have access to the necessary software tools to do so. </p>

  <p>[1372] Aspartate racemase (EC 5.1.1.13) and glutamate racemase (EC 5.1.1.3) are two
   evolutionary related bacterial enzymes that do not seem to require a cofactor for their activity
   [1]. Glutamate racemase, which interconverts L-glutamate into D-glutamate, is required for the
   biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and some peptide-based antibiotics such as gramicidin S. In
   addition to characterized aspartate and glutamate racemases, this family also includes a
   hypothetical protein from Erwinia carotovora and one from Escherichia coli (ygeA). Two conserved
   cysteines are present in the sequence of these enzymes. They are expected to play a role in
   catalytic activity by acting as bases in proton abstraction from the substrate. Signature
   patterns were developed for both cysteines. Consensus pattern:

   [1,2] (also known as complex I or NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is an oligomeric enzymatic
   complex located in the inner mitochondrial membrane which also seems to exist in the chloroplast
   and in cyanobacteria (as a NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase). Among the 25 to 30 polypeptide
   subunits of this bioenergetic enzyme complex there is one with a molecular weight of 51 Kd (in
   mammals), which is the second largest subunit of complex I and is a component of the iron-sulfur
   (IP) fragment of the enzyme. It seems to bind to NAD, FMN, and a 2Fe-2S cluster. </p>
  <p>[1378] The 51 Kd subunit is highly similar to [3,4]: Subunit alpha of Alcaligenes eutrophus

   sequence similarities. The first one most probably corresponds to the NAD-binding site, the
   second to the FMN-binding site, and the third one, which contains three cysteines, to the
   iron-sulfur binding region. Signature patterns have been developed for the FMN-binding and for

  <p> General diffusion Gram-negative porins signature </p>
  <p>[1391] Cross-reference(s) PS00576; GRAM_NEG_PORIN The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria
   acts as a molecular filter for hydrophilic compounds. Proteins, known as porins [1], are
   responsible for the 'molecular sieve' properties of the outer membrane. Porins form large water-
   filled channels which allows the diffusion of hydrophilic molecules into the periplasmic space.
   Some porins form general diffusion channels that allows any solutes up to a certain size (that
   size is known as the exclusion limit) to cross the membrane, while other porins are specific for
   a solute and contain a binding site for that solute inside the pores (these are known as
   selective porins). As porins are the major outer membrane proteins, they also serve as receptor
   sites for the binding of phages and bacteriocins. General diffusion porins generally assemble as
   trimer in the membrane and the transmembrane core of these proteins is composed exclusively of
   beta strands [2]. It has been shown [3] that a number of general porins are evolutionary related,
   these porins are: Enterobacteria phoE. Enterobacteria ompC. Enterobacteria ompF. Enterobacteria
   nmpC. Bacteriophage PA-2 LC. Neisseria PI.A. Neisseria PI.B. </p>

   of these proteins, which spans two putative transmembrane beta strands. Consensus pattern:

  <p>[1419] This family of ribosomal proteins consists mainly of the 40S ribosomal protein S27a
   which is synthesized as a C-terminal extension of ubiquitin (CEP). The S27a domain compromises
   the C-terminal half of the protein. The synthesis of ribosomal proteins as extensions of
   ubiquitin promotes their incorporation into nascent ribosomes by a transient metabolic
   stabilization and is required for efficient ribosome biogenesis [3]. The ribosomal extension
   protein S27a contains a basic region that is proposed to form a zinc finger; its fusion gene is

  <p>[1424] Cross-reference(s) PS00547; TRANSGLUTAMINASES Transglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13) (TGase)
   [1,2] are calcium-dependent enzymes that catalyze the cross-linking of proteins by promoting the
   formation of isopeptide bonds between the gamma-carboxyl group of a glutamine in one polypeptide
   chain and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine in a second polypeptide chain. TGases also catalyze
   the conjugation of polyamines to proteins. The best known transglutaminase is blood coagulation
   factor XIII, a plasma tetrameric protein composed of two catalytic A subunits and two
   non-catalytic B subunits. Factor XIII is responsible for cross-linking fibrin chains, thus
   stabilizing the fibrin clot. Other forms of transglutaminases are widely distributed in various
   organs, tissues and body fluids. Sequence data is available for the following forms of TGase:
   Transglutaminase K (Tgase K), a membrane-bound enzyme found in mammalian epidermis and important
   for the formation of the cornified cell envelope (gene TGM1). Tissue transglutaminase (TGase C),
   a monomeric ubiquitous enzyme located in the cytoplasm (gene TGM2). Transglutaminase 3,
   responsible for the later stages of cell envelope formation in the epidermis and the hair
   follicle (gene TGM3). Transglutaminase 4 (gene TGM4). </p>
  <p>[1425] A conserved cysteine is known to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of TGases. The
   erythrocyte membrane band 4.2 protein, which probably plays an important role in regulating the
   shape of erythrocytes and their mechanical properties, is evolutionary related to TGases. However
   the active site cysteine is substituted by an alanine and the 4.2 protein does not show TGase

  <p>[1431] Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (EC 2.4.2.30) (PARP) [1,2] is a eukaryotic enzyme that
   catalyzes the covalent attachment of ADP-ribose units from NAD(+) to various nuclear acceptor
   proteins. This post-translational modification of nuclear proteins is dependent on DNA. It
   appears to be involved in the regulation of various important cellular processes such as
   differentiation, proliferation and tumor transformation as well as in the regulation of the
   molecular events involved in the recovery of the cell from DNA damage. Structurally, PARP, about
   1000 amino-acids residues long, consists of three distinct domains: an N-terminal zinc-dependent
   DNA-binding domain, a central automodification domain and a C-terminal NAD-binding domain. The
   DNA-binding region contains a pair of zinc finger domains which have been shown to bind DNA in a
   zinc-dependent manner. The zinc finger domains of PARP seem to bind specifically to
   single-stranded DNA. DNA ligase III [3] contains, in its N-terminal section, a single copy of a
   zinc finger highly similar to those of PARP. Consensus pattern:

   have been grouped [1 to 7] under the designation of DNA polymerase family B. These are: Higher

  <p>[1435] DNA polymerases (EC 2.7.7.7) can be classified, on the basis of sequence similarity [1],
   into at least four different groups: A, B, C and X. DNA polymerases that belong to family X are
   listed below [2]: Vertebrate polymerase beta, involved in DNA repair. Yeast polymerase IV (POL4)
   [3], an enzyme with similar characteristics to that of the mammalian polymerase beta. Terminal
   deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) (EC 2.7.7.31). TdT catalyzes the elongation of
   polydeoxynucleotide chains by terminal addition. One of the functions of this enzyme is the
   addition of nucleotides at the junction of rearranged Ig heavy chain and T cell receptor gene
   segments during the maturation of B and T cells. African Swine Fever virus protein O174L [4].

   addition of each nucleotide. </p>
  <p>[1437] As a signature pattern for this family of DNA polymerases, a highly conserved region
   that contains a conserved arginine and two conserved aspartic acid residues were selected. The

  <p>[1443] The functional significance of EGF domains in what appear to be unrelated proteins is
   not yet clear. However, a common feature is that these repeats are found in the extracellular
   domain of membrane-bound proteins or in proteins known to be secreted (exception: prostaglandin
   G/H synthase). The EGF domain includes six cysteine residues which have been shown (in EGF) to be
   involved in disulfide bonds. The main structure is a two-stranded beta-sheet followed by a loop
   to a C-terminal short two-stranded sheet. Subdomains between the conserved cysteines strongly
   vary in length as shown in the following schematic representation of the EGF-like domain:
   EMI710.1 </p>
  <p>[1444] The region between the 5th and 6th cysteine contains two conserved glycines of which at
   least one is present in most EGF-like domains. Two patterns were created for this domain, each
   including one of these C-terminal conserved glycine residues. Consensus pattern:
   C-x-C-x(5)-G-x(2)-C [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds] Sequences known to belong to this
   class detected by the pattern A majority, but not those that have very long or very short regions
   between the last 3 conserved cysteines of their EGF-like domain(s). Other sequence(s) detected in
   SWISS-PROT87 proteins, of which 27 can be considered as possible candidates. Consensus pattern:
   C-x-C-x(2)-[GP]-[FYW]-x(4,8)-C [The three C's are involved in disulfide bonds]Sequences known to
   belong to this class detected by the patternA majority, but not those that have very long or very
   short regions between the last 3 conserved cysteines of their EGF-like domain(s). Other
   sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT83 proteins, of which 49 can be considered as possible
   candidates. Note The beta chain of the integrin family of proteins contains 2 cysteine- rich
   repeats which were said to be dissimilar with the EGF pattern [7]. Note Laminin EGF-like repeats
   (see &lt;PDOC00961&gt;) are longer than the average EGF module and contain a further disulfide
   bond C-terminal of the EGF-like region. Perlecan and agrin contain both EGF-like domains and
   laminin-type EGF-like domains. Note the pattern do not detect all of the repeats of proteins with
   multiple EGF-like repeats. Note see &lt;PDOC00913&gt; for an entry describing specifically the
   subset of EGF- like domains that bind calcium. [ 1] <ref type="npl">Davis C.G. New Biol. 2:410-419(1990)</ref>. [ 2]

  <p> 891. (HCO3_cotransp) </p>
  <p>[1446] Anion exchange is a cellular transport function which contributes to the regulation of
   cell pH and volume. Anion exchangers are a family of functionally related proteins that
   contributes to these properties by maintaining the intracellular level of the two principal
   anions: chloride and HCO3-. The best characterized anion exchanger is the band 3 protein [1],
   which is an erythrocyte anion exchange membrane glycoprotein. Band 3 is a protein of about 900
   amino acids which consists of a cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of about 400 residues and an
   hydrophobic C-terminal section of about 500 residues that contains at least ten transmembrane
   regions. The cytoplasmic domain provides binding sites for cytoskeletal proteins, while the
   integral membrane domain is responsible for anion transport. Band 3 protein is specific to
   erythroid cells, at least two other proteins [2] structurally and functionally related to band 3,
   are found in nonerythroid tissues: AE2 (or B3 related protein; B3RP), a protein of 1200 residues,
   which seems to be present in a variety of cell types including lymphoid, kidney, and choroid
   plexus. AE3, a protein of 1200 residues, which is specific to neurons. Structurally AE2 and AE3
   are very similar to band 3, the main difference being an extension of some 300 residues of the
   N-terminal domain in AE2 and AE3. </p>
  <p>[1447] Two signature patterns were developed for these proteins. The first pattern is based on
   a conserved stretch of sequence that contains four clustered positive charged residues and which
   is located at the C-terminal extremity of the cytoplasmic domain, just before the first
   transmembrane segment from the integral domain. The second pattern is based on the perfectly
   conserved sequence of the fifth transmembrane segment; this segment contains a lysine, which is
   the covalent binding site for the isothiocyanate group of DIDS, an inhibitor of anion exchange.

  <p> 894. NEUROHYPOPHYS_HORM (hormones) </p>
  <p>[1450] Oxytocin (or ocytocin) and vasopressin [1] are small (nine amino acid residues),
   structurally and functionally related neurohypophysial peptide hormones. Oxytocin causes
   contraction of the smooth muscle of the uterus and of the mammary gland while vasopressin has a
   direct antidiuretic action on the kidney and also causes vasoconstriction of the peripheral
   vessels. Like the majority of active peptides, both hormones are synthesized as larger protein
   precursors that are enzymatically converted to their mature forms. Peptides belonging to this
   family are also found in birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians (mesotocin, isotocin, valitocin,
   glumitocin, aspargtocin, vasotocin, seritocin, asvatocin, phasvatocin), in worms (annetocin),
   octopi (cephalotocin), locust (locupressin or neuropeptide F1/F2) and in molluscs (conopressins G
   and S) [2]. The pattern developed to detect this category of peptides spans their entire sequence
   and includes four invariant amino acid residues. Consensus pattern C-[LIFY](2)-x-N-[CS]-P-x-G

  <p> 895. 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin-pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) </p>
  <p>[1451] All organisms require reduced folate cofactors for the synthesis of a variety of
   metabolites. Most microorganisms must synthesize folate de novo because they lack the active
   transport system of higher vertebrate cells which allows these organisms to use dietary folates.
   Enzymes involved in folate biosynthesis are therefore targets for a variety of antimicrobial
   agents such as trimethoprim or sulfonamides. 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterinpyrophosphokinase
   (EC 2.7.6.3) (HPPK) catalyzes the attachment of pyrophosphate to
   6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin to form 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine pyrophosphate.
   This is the first step in a three-step pathway leading to 7,8-dihydrofolate. Bacterial HPPK (gene
   folK or sulD) [1] is a protein of 160 to 270 amino acids. In the lower eukaryote Pneumocystis
   carinii, HPPK is the central domain of a multifunctional folate synthesis enzyme (gene fas) [2].
   As a signature for HPPK, a conserved region located in the central section of these enzymes was
   selected. Consensus pattern [KRHD]-x-[GA]-[PSAE]-R-x(2)-D-[LIV]-D-[LIVM](2) Sequences known to
   belong to this class detected by the pattern ALL. Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROTNONE. [

  <p>[1457] The ribosome recycling factor (RRF / ribosome release factor) dissociates the ribosome
   from the mRNA after termination of translation, and is essential bacterial growth [1]. Thus
   ribosomes are &quot;recycled&quot; and ready for another round of protein synthesis. Number of

  <p> 902. S-layer homology(SLH) </p>
  <p>[1458] S-layers are paracrystalline mono-layered assemblies of (glyco)proteins which coat the
   surface of bacteria [1]. Several S-layer proteins and some other cell wall proteins contain one
   or more copies of a domain of about 50-60 residues, which has been called SLH (for S-layer
   homology) [2]. There is strong evidence that this domain serves as an anchor to the peptidoglycan
   [3]. The SLH domain has been found in: S-layer glycoprotein of Acetogenium kivui (3 copies).
   S-layer 125 Kd protein of Bacillus sphaericus (3 copies). S-layer protein of Bacillus anthracis
   (3 copies). S-layer protein of Bacillus licheniformis (3 copies). S-layer protein (HWP) from

   protein Omp-alpha from Thermotoga maritima (1 copy). Cellulosome anchoring protein (gene ancA),
   outer layer protein B (OlpB) and a further potential cell surface glycoprotein from Clostridium

   end of the third copy; may have arisen by circular permutation). Amylopullulanase (gene amyB)
   from Thermoanaerobacter thermosulfurogenes (3 copies) Amylopullulanase (gene aapT) from Bacillus

   Thermoanaerobacter saccharolyticum (2 copies; 3 copies if a frameshift is taken into account).
   Protein involved in butirosin production (ButB) from Bacillus circulans (2 incomplete copies; 3
   copies if three frameshifts are taken into account). Two hypothetical proteins from Synechocystis

   amylopullulanases found 3' of amylase gene from Bacillus circulans (fragment of 1 copy; 3 copies
   if two frameshifts are taken into account). SLH domains are found at the N- or C-termini of
   mature proteins. They occur in single copy followed by a predicted coiled coil domain, or in
   three contiguous copies. Structurally, the SLH domain is predicted to contain two alpha-helices
   flanking a beta strand. The SLH sequences are fairly divergent with an average identity of about
   25%. It is however possible to build a sequence pattern that starts at the second position of the
   domain and that spans 3/4 of its length. Consensus

  <p>[1459] This is a family of queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferases EC:2.4.2.29, also known as
   tRNA-guanine transglycosylase and guanine insertion enzyme. Queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase
   modifies tRNAs for asparagine, aspartic acid, histidine and tyrosine with queuine. It catalyses
   the exchange of guanine-34 at the wobble position with 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine, and the
   addition of a cyclopentenediol moiety to 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine-34 tRNA; giving a
   hypermodified base queuine in the wobble position [1,2].The aligned region contains a zinc

   specifically to tRNA form a complex with methionyl-tRNA synthetases [2]. In human tyrosyl-tRNA

  <p> 910. (WW) </p>
  <p>[1467] The WW domain [1-4,E1] (also known as rsp5 or WWP) has been originally discovered as a
   short conserved region in a number of unrelated proteins, among them dystrophin, the gene
   responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The domain, which spans about 35 residues, is
   repeated up to 4 times in some proteins. It has been shown [5] to bind proteins with particular
   proline- motifs, [AP]-P-P-[AP]-Y, and thus resembles somewhat SH3 domains. It appears to contain
   beta-strands grouped around four conserved aromatic positions; generally Trp. The name WW or WWP
   derives from the presence of these Trp as well as that of a conserved Pro. It is frequently
   associated with other domains typical for proteins in signal transduction processes. </p>
  <p>[1468] Proteins containing the WW domain are listed below. Dystrophin, a multidomain
   cytoskeletal protein. Its longest alternatively spliced form consists of an N-terminal
   actin-binding domain, followed by 24 spectrin-like repeats, a cysteine-rich calcium-binding
   domain and a C- terminal globular domain. Dystrophin form tetramers and is thought to have
   multiple functions including involvement in membrane stability, transduction of contractile
   forces to the extracellular environment and organization of membrane specialization. Mutations in
   the dystrophin gene lead to muscular dystrophy of Duchenne or Becker type. Dystrophin contains
   one WW domain C-terminal of the spectrin-repeats. Utrophin, a dystrophin-like protein of unknown
   function. Vertebrate YAP protein is a substrate of an unknown serine kinase. It binds to the SH3
   domain of the Yes oncoprotein via a proline-rich region. This protein appears in alternatively
   spliced isoforms, containing either one or two WW domains [6]. Mouse NEDD-4 plays a role in the
   embryonic development and differentiation of the central nervous system. It contains 3 WW modules
   followed by a HECT domain. The human ortholog contains 4 WW domains, but the third WW domain is
   probably spliced resulting in an alternate NEDD-4 protein with only 3 WW modules [3]. Yeast RSP5
   is similar to NEDD-4 in its molecular organization. It contains an N-terminal C2 domain (see
   &lt;PDOC00380&gt;, followed by a histidine-rich region, 3 WW domains and a HECT domain. Rat FE65,
   a transcription-factor activator expressed preferentially in liver. The activator domain is
   located within the N-terminal 232 residues of FE65, which also contain the WW domain. Yeast
   ESS1/PTF1, a putative peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase from family ppiC (see
   &lt;PDOC00840&gt;). A related protein, dodo (gene dod) exists in Drosophila and in mammals (gene
   PIN1). Tobacco DB10 protein. The WW domain is located N-terminal to the region with similarity to
   ATP-dependent RNA helicases. IQGAP, a human GTPase activating protein acting on ras. It contains
   an N- terminal domain similar to fly muscle mp20 protein and a C-terminal ras GTPase activator
   domain. Yeast pre-mRNA processing protein PRP40, Caenorhabditis elegans ZK1098.1 and fission
   yeast SpAC13C5.02 are related proteins with similarity to MYO2- type myosin, each containing two
   WW-domains at the N-terminus. Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C38D4.5, which contains
   one WW module, a PH domain (see &lt;PDOC50003&gt;) and a C-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
   domain. Yeast hypothetical protein YFL010c. For the sensitive detection of WW domains, a profile
   was developed which spans the whole homology region as well as a pattern. Consensus pattern

  <p> 911. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) [1] (XPG_1) </p>
  <p>[1469] Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) [1] is a human autosomal recessive disease, characterized by
   a high incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancer. People's skin cells with this condition are
   hypersensitive to ultraviolet light, due to defects in the incision step of DNA excision repair.
   There are a minimum of seven genetic complementation groups involved in this pathway: XP-A to
   XP-G. The defect in XP-G can be corrected by a 133 Kd nuclear protein called XPG (or XPGC) [2]. </p>
  <p>[1470] XPG belongs to a family of proteins [2,3,4,5,6] that are composed of two main subsets:
   Subset 1, to which belongs XPG, RAD2 from budding yeast and rad13 from fission yeast. RAD2 and
   XPG are single-stranded DNA endonucleases [7,8]. XPG makes the 3'incision in human DNA nucleotide
   excision repair [9]. Subset 2, to which belongs mouse and human FEN-1, rad2 from fission yeast,
   and RAD27 from budding yeast. FEN-1 is a structure-specific endonuclease. </p>
  <p>[1471] In addition to the proteins listed in the above groups, this family also includes:
   Fission yeast exol, a 5'-&gt;3' double-stranded DNA exonuclease that could act in a pathway that
   corrects mismatched base pairs. Yeast EXO1 (DHS1), a protein with probably the same function as
   exo1. Yeast DIN7. </p>
  <p>[1472] Sequence alignment of this family of proteins reveals that similarities are largely
   confined to two regions. The first is located at the N-terminal extremity (N-region) and
   corresponds to the first 95 to 105 amino acids. The second region is internal (I-region) and
   found towards the C-terminus; it spans about 140 residues and contains a highly conserved core of
   27 amino acids that includes a conserved pentapeptide (E-A-[DE]-A-[QS]). It is possible that the
   conserved acidic residues are involved in the catalytic mechanism of DNA excision repair in XPG.
   The amino acids linking the N- and I-regions are not conserved; indeed, they are largely absent
   from proteins belonging to the second subset. </p>
  <p>[1473] Two signature patterns were developed for these proteins. The first corresponds to the
   central part of the N-region, the second to part of the I-region and includes the putative
   catalytic core pentapeptide. </p>

  <p>[1479] Natriuretic peptides are hormones involved in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte
   homeostasis. These hormones stimulate the intracellular production of cyclic GMP as a second
   messenger. </p>
  <p>[1480] Currently, three types of natriuretic peptide receptors are known [1,2]. Two express
   guanylate cyclase activity: GC-A (or ANP-A) which seems specific to atrial natriuretic peptide
   (ANP), and GC-B (or ANP-B) which seems to be stimulated more effectively by brain natriuretic
   peptide (BNP) than by ANP. The third receptor (ANP-C) is probably responsible for the clearance
   of ANP from the circulation and does not play a role in signal transduction. </p>
  <p>[1481] GC-A and GC-B are plasma membrane-bound proteins that share the following topology: an
   N-terminal extracellular domain which acts as the ligand binding region, then a transmembrane
   domain followed by a large cytoplasmic C- terminal region that can be subdivided into two
   domains: a protein kinase-like domain (see &lt;PDOC00100&gt;) that appears important for proper
   signalling and a guanylate cyclase catalytic domain (see &lt;PDOC00425&gt;). The topology of
   ANP-C is different: like GC-A and -B it possesses an extracellular ligand-binding region and a
   transmembrane domain, but its cytoplasmic domain is very short. </p>
  <p>[1482] A pattern was developed from the ligand-binding region of natriuretic peptide receptors
   based on a highly conserved region located in the N-terminal part of the domain. Consensus

  <p>[1485] Myc-type, 'helix-loop-helix' dimerization domain signature HELIX_LOOP_HELIX </p>
  <p>[1486] A number of eukaryotic proteins, which probably are sequence specific DNA- binding
   proteins that act as transcription factors, share a conserved domain of 40 to 50 amino acid
   residues. It has been proposed [1] that this domain is formed of two amphipathic helices joined
   by a variable length linker region that could form a loop. This 'helix-loop-helix' (HLH) domain
   mediates protein dimerization and has been found in the proteins listed below [2,3,E1,E2]. Most
   of these proteins have an extra basic region of about 15 amino acid residues that is adjacent to
   the HLH domain and specifically binds to DNA. They are refered as basic helix-loop-helix proteins
   (bHLH), and are classified in two groups: class A (ubiquitous) and class B (tissue-specific).
   Members of the bHLH family bind variations on the core sequence 'CANNTG', also refered to as the
   E-box motif. The homo- or heterodimerization mediated by the HLH domain is independent of, but
   necessary for DNA binding, as two basic regions are required for DNA binding activity. The HLH
   proteins lacking the basic domain (Emc, Id) function as negative regulators since they form
   heterodimers, but fail to bind DNA. The hairy-related proteins (hairy, E(sp1), deadpan) also
   repress transcription although they can bind DNA. The proteins of this subfamily act together
   with co-repressor proteins, like groucho, through their C-terminal motif WRPW. The myc family of
   cellular oncogenes [4], which is currently known to contain four members: c-myc [E3], N-myc,

  <p> 919. (Beta-lactamase) </p>
  <p> Beta-lactamases classes -A, -C, and -D active site </p>
  <p>[1489] Beta-lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6) [1,2] are enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of an amide
   bond in the beta-lactam ring of antibiotics belonging to the penicillin/cephalosporin family.
   Four kinds of beta-lactamase have been identified [3]. Class-B enzymes are zinc containing
   proteins whilst class -A, C and D enzymes are serine hydrolases. The three classes of serine
   beta-lactamases are evolutionary related and belong to a superfamily [4] that also includes
   DD-peptidases and a variety of other penicillin-binding proteins (PBP's). All these proteins
   contain a Ser-x-x-Lys motif, where the serine is the active site residue. Although clearly
   homologous, the sequences of the three classes of serine beta-lactamases exhibit a large degree
   of variability and only a small number of residues are conserved in addition to the catalytic
   serine. </p>
  <p>[1490] Since a pattern detecting all serine beta-lactamases would also pick up many unrelated
   sequences, it was decided to provide specific patterns, centered on the active site serine, for
   each of the three classes. Consensus pattern [FY]-x-[LIVMFY]-x-S-[TV]-x-K-x(4)-[AGLM]-x(2)-[LC]

  <p>[1491] Biotin is covalently attached at the active site of certain enzymes that transfer carbon
   dioxide from bicarbonate to organic acids to form cellular metabolites. Biotin protein ligase
   (BPL) is the enzyme responsible for attaching biotin to a specific lysine at the active site of
   biotin enzymes. Each organism probably has only one BPL. Biotin attachment is a two step reaction
   that results in the formation of an amide linkage between the carboxyl group of biotin and the
   epsilon-amino group of the modified lysine [2]. Number of members: 26 [1] <ref type="npl">Wilson KP, Shewchuk LM,

  <p> 927. (COX2) </p>
  <p>[1499] Cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) [1,2] is an oligomeric enzymatic complex which is a
   component of the respiratory chain and is involved in the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c
   to oxygen. In eukaryotes this enzyme complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane; in
   aerobic prokaryotes it is found in the plasma membrane. The enzyme complex consists of 3-4
   subunits (prokaryotes) to up to 13 polypeptides (mammals). </p>
  <p>[1500] Subunit 2 (CO II) transfers the electrons from cytochrome c to the catalytic subunit 1.
   It contains two adjacent transmembrane regions in its N-terminus and the major part of the
   protein is exposed to the periplasmic or to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, respectively.
   CO II provides the substrate- binding site and contains a copper center called Cu(A), probably
   the primary acceptor in cytochrome c oxidase. An exception is the corresponding subunit of the
   cbb3-type oxidase which lacks the copper A redox-center. Several bacterial CO II have a
   C-terminal extension that contains a covalently bound heme c. </p>
  <p>[1501] It has been shown [3,4] that nitrous oxide reductase (EC 1.7.99.6) (gene nosZ) of
   Pseudomonas has sequence similarity in its C-terminus to CO II. This enzyme is part of the
   bacterial respiratory system which is activated under anaerobic conditions in the presence of
   nitrate or nitrous oxide. NosZ is a periplasmic homodimer that contains a dinuclear copper
   center, probably located in a 3- dimensional fold similar to the cupredoxin-like fold that has
   been suggested for the copper-binding site of CO II [3]. </p>
  <p>[1502] The dinuclear purple copper center is formed by 2 histidines and 2 cysteines [5]. This
   region was used as a signature pattern. The conserved valine and the conserved methionine are
   said to be involved in stabilizing the copper-binding fold by interacting with each other.

   mitochondria and bacteria; CycK from Rhizobium[3], CcmC from E. coli and Paracoccus denitrificans
   [2,1] and orf240 from wheat mitochondria [4]. The members of this family are probably integral
   membrane proteins with six predicted transmembrane helices. It has been proposed that members of
   this family comprise a membrane component of an ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter complex.
   It is also proposed that this transporter is necessary for transport of some component needed for
   cytochrome c assembly. One member CycK contains a putative heme-binding motif [3], orf240 also
   contains a putative heme-binding motif and is a proposed ABC transporter with c-type heme as its
   proposed substrate [4]. However it seems unlikely that all members of this family transport heme
   nor c-type apocytochromes because CcmC in the putative CcmABC transporter transports neither [1].

  <p>[1504] Cytochrome b559 [1] is an essential component of photosystem II complex from oxygenic
   photosynthetic organisms. It is an integral thylakoid membrane protein composed of two subunits,
   alpha (gene psbE) and beta (gene psbF), each of which contains a histidine residue located in a
   transmembrane region. The two histidines coordinate the heme iron of cytochrome b559. </p>
  <p>[1505] The region around the heme-binding residue of both subunits is very similar and can be
   used as a signature pattern. Consensus

  <p> 930. Cytochrome b/b6 signatures (Cytochrome_b) </p>
  <p>[1506] In the mitochondrion of eukaryotes and in aerobic prokaryotes, cytochrome b is a
   component of respiratory chain complex III (EC 1.10.2.2) - also known as the bc1 complex or
   ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. In plant chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, there is a analogous
   protein, cytochrome b6, a component of the plastoquinone-plastocyanin reductase (EC 1.10.99.1),
   also known as the b6f complex. </p>
  <p>[1507] Cytochrome b/b6 [1,2] is an integral membrane protein of approximately 400 amino acid
   residues that probably has 8 transmembrane segments. In plants and cyanobacteria, cytochrome b6
   consists of two subunits encoded by the petB and petD genes. The sequence of petB is colinear
   with the N-terminal part of mitochondrial cytochrome b, while petD corresponds to the C-terminal
   part. Cytochrome b/b6 non-covalently binds two heme groups, known as b562 and b566. Four
   conserved histidine residues are postulated to be the ligands of the iron atoms of these two heme
   groups. </p>
  <p>[1508] Apart from regions around some of the histidine heme ligands, there are a few conserved
   regions in the sequence of b/b6. The best conserved of these regions includes an invariant P-E-W
   triplet which lies in the loop that separates the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments. It
   seems to be important for electron transfer at the ubiquinone redox site - called Qz or Qo (where
   o stands for outside) - located on the outer side of the membrane. </p>
  <p>[1509] A schematic representation of the structure of cytochrome b/b6 is shown below. EMI742.1 </p>
  <p>[1510] Two signature patterns were developed for cytochrome b/b6. The first includes the first
   conserved histidine of b/b6, which is a heme b562 ligand; the second includes the conserved PEW
   triplet. Consensus pattern [DENQ]-x(3)-G-[FYWMQ]-x-[LIVMF]-R-x(2)-H [H is a heme b562 ligand]

  <p> 931. Phorbol esters / diacylglycerol binding domain (DAG_PE-bind) </p>
  <p>[1511] Diacylglycerol (DAG) is an important second messenger. Phorbol esters (PE) are analogues
   of DAG and potent tumor promoters that cause a variety of physiological changes when administered
   to both cells and tissues. DAG activates a family of serine/threonine protein kinases,
   collectively known as protein kinase C (PKC) [1]. Phorbol esters can directly stimulate PKC. The
   N- terminal region of PKC, known as C1, has been shown [2] to bind PE and DAG in a phospholipid
   and zinc-dependent fashion. The C1 region contains one or two copies (depending on the isozyme of
   PKC) of a cysteine-rich domain about 50 amino-acid residues long and essential for
   DAG/PE-binding. Such a domain has also been found in the following proteins: Diacylglycerol
   kinase (EC 2.7.1.107) (DGK) [3], the enzyme that converts DAG into phosphatidate. It contains two
   copies of the DAG/PE-binding domain in its N-terminal section. At least five different forms of
   DGK are known in mammals. N-chimaerin. A brain specific protein which shows sequence similarities
   with the BCR protein at its C-terminal part and contains a single copy of the DAG/PE-binding
   domain at its N-terminal part. It has been shown [4,5] to be able to bind phorbol esters. The
   raf/mil family of serine/threonine protein kinases. These protein kinases contain a single
   N-terminal copy of the DAG/PE-binding domain. The unc-13 protein from Caenorhabditis elegans. Its
   function is not known but it contains a copy of the DAG/PE-binding domain in its central section
   and has been shown to bind specifically to a phorbol ester in the presence of calcium [6]. The
   vav oncogene. Vav was generated by a genetic rearrangement during gene transfer assays. Its
   expression seems to be restricted to cells of hematopoeitic origin. Vav seems [5,7] to contain a
   DAG/PE-binding domain in the central part of the protein. The Drosophila GTPase activating
   protein rotund. </p>
  <p>[1512] The DAG/PE-binding domain binds two zinc ions; the ligands of these metal ions are
   probably the six cysteines and two histidines that are conserved in this domain. A signature
   pattern was developed that spans completely the DAG/PE domain. Consensus pattern

  <p>[1517] DNA topoisomerase I (EC 5.99.1.2) [1,2,3,4,E1] is one of the two types of enzyme that
   catalyze the interconversion of topological DNA isomers. Type II topoisomerases are ATP-dependent
   and act by passing a DNA segment through a transient double-strand break. Topoisomerase II is
   found in phages, archaebacteria, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and in African Swine Fever virus (ASF).
   In bacteriophage T4 topoisomerase II consists of three subunits (the product of genes 39, 52 and
   60). In prokaryotes and in archaebacteria the enzyme, known as DNA gyrase, consists of two
   subunits (genes gyrA and gyrB [E2]). In some bacteria, a second type II topoisomerase has been

  <p> 937. Prolyl oligopeptidase family serine active site (DPPIV_N_term) </p>
  <p>[1523] The prolyl oligopeptidase family [1,2,3] consist of a number of evolutionary related
   peptidases whose catalytic activity seems to be provided by a charge relay system similar to that
   of the trypsin family of serine proteases, but which evolved by independent convergent evolution.
   The known members of this family are listed below. Prolyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26) (PE) (also
   called post-proline cleaving enzyme). PE is an enzyme that cleaves peptide bonds on the
   C-terminal side of prolyl residues. The sequence of PE has been obtained from a mammalian species
   (pig) and from bacteria (Flavobacterium meningosepticum and Aeromonas hydrophila); there is a
   high degree of sequence conservation between these sequences. Escherichia coli protease II (EC
   3.4.21.83) (oligopeptidase B) (gene prtB) which cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of
   lysyl and argininyl residues. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5) (DPP IV). DPP IV is an enzyme
   that removes N-terminal dipeptides sequentially from polypeptides having unsubstituted N-termini
   provided that the penultimate residue is proline. Yeast vacuolar dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A
   (DPAP A) (gene: STE13) which is responsible for the proteolytic maturation of the alpha-factor
   precursor. Yeast vacuolar dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAP B) (gene: DAP2).
   Acylamino-acid-releasing enzyme (EC 3.4.19.1) (acyl-peptide hydrolase). This enzyme catalyzes the
   hydrolysis of the amino-terminal peptide bond of an N-acetylated protein to generate a
   N-acetylated amino acid and a protein with a free amino-terminus. </p>
  <p>[1524] A conserved serine residue has experimentally been shown (in E.coli protease II as well
   as in pig and bacterial PE) to be necessary for the catalytic mechanism. This serine, which is
   part of the catalytic triad (Ser, His, Asp), is generally located about 150 residues away from
   the C-terminal extremity of these enzymes (which are all proteins that contains about 700 to 800
   amino acids). Consensus pattern D-x(3)-A-x(3)-[LIVMFYW]-x(14)-G-x-S-x-G-G-[LIVMFYW](2) [S is the

   glycine/ proline-rich sequence and a C-terminal galaptin domain. Galectin-4 [4], which is
   composed of two galaptin domains. Galectin-5. Galectin-7 [5], a keratinocyte protein which could
   be involved in cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions necessary for normal growth control.

   two galaptin domains. Human eosinophil lysophospholipase (EC 3.1.1.5) [8] (Charcot-Leyden crystal

  <p> PROSITE: PDOC00567. PROSITE cross-reference(s) PS00662; T2SP_E </p>
  <p>[1545] A number of bacterial proteins, some of which are involved in a general secretion
   pathway (GSP) for the export of proteins (also called the type II pathway) [1,2], have been found
   to be evolutionary related. These proteins are listed below: The 'E' protein from the GSP operon
   of: Aeromonas (gene exeE); Erwinia (gene outE); Escherichia coli (gene yheG); Klebsiella
   pneumoniae (gene pulE); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gene xcpR); Vibrio cholerae (gene epsE) and
   Xanthomonas campestris (gene xpsE). Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid virB operon protein 11.
   This protein is required for the transfer of T-DNA to plants. Bacillus subtilis comG operon
   protein 1 which is required for the uptake of DNA by competent Bacillus subtilis cells. Aeromonas
   hydrophila tapB, involved in type IV pilus assembly. Pseudomonas protein pilB, which is essential
   for the formation of the pili. Pseudomonas aeruginosa protein twitching mobility protein pilT.
   Neisseria gonorrhoeae type IV pilus assembly protein pilF. Vibrio cholerae protein tcpT, which is
   involved in the biosynthesis of the tcp pilus. Escherichia coli protein hofB (hopB). Escherichia
   coli hypothetical protein ygcB. Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yggR. </p>
  <p>[1546] These proteins have from 344 (pilT and virB11) to 568 (tapB) amino acids, they are
   probably cytoplasmically located and, on the basis of the presence of a conserved P-loop region
   (see &lt;PDOC00017&gt;), probably bind ATP. A region that overlaps the 'B' motif of ATP-binding

  <p> 955. (guanylate_cyc) Guanylate cyclases signature </p>
  <p> PROSITE: PDOC00425. PROSITE cross-reference(s) PS00452; </p>
  <p>[1547] GUANYLATE_CYCLASES Guanylate cyclases (EC 4.6.1.2) [1 to 4] catalyze the formation of
   cyclic GMP (cGMP) from GTP. cGMP acts as an intracellular messenger, activating cGMP dependent
   kinases and regulating CGMP-sensitive ion channels. The role of cGMP as a second messenger in
   vascular smooth muscle relaxation and retinal photo-transduction is well established. Guanylate
   cyclase is found both in the soluble and particular fraction of eukaryotic cells. The soluble and
   plasma membrane-bound forms differ in structure, regulation and other properties. </p>
  <p>[1548] Most currently known plasma membrane-bound forms are receptors for small polypeptides.
   The topology of such proteins is the following: they have a N-terminal extracellular domain which
   acts as the ligand binding region, then a transmembrane domain, followed by a large cytoplasmic
   C-terminal region that can be subdivided into two domains: a protein kinase-like domain that
   appears important for proper signalling and a cyclase catalytic domain. This topology is
   schematically represented below. EMI758.1 </p>
  <p>[1549] The known guanylate cyclase receptors are: The sea-urchins receptors for speract and
   resact, which are small peptides that stimulate sperm motility and metabolism. The receptors for
   natriuretic peptides (ANF). Two forms of ANF receptors with guanylate cyclase activity are
   currently known: GC-A (or ANP-A) which seems specific to atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and
   GC-B (or ANP-B) which seems to be stimulated more effectively by brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)
   than by ANP. The receptor for Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin (GC-C). The endogenous
   ligand for this intestinal receptor seems to be a small peptide called guanylin. Retinal
   guanylate cyclase (retGC) which probably plays a specific functional role in the rods and/or
   cones of photoreceptors. It is not known if this protein acts as receptor, but its structure is
   similar to that of the other plasma membrane-bound GCs. </p>
  <p>[1550] The soluble forms of guanylate cyclase are cytoplasmic heterodimers. The two subunits,
   alpha and beta are proteins of from 70 to 82 Kd which are highly related. Two forms of beta
   subunits are currently known: beta-1 which seems to be expressed in lung and brain, and beta-2
   which is more abundant in kidney and liver. </p>
  <p>[1551] The membrane and cytoplasmic forms of guanylate cyclase share a conserved domain which
   is probably important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Such a domain is also found twice
   in the different forms of membrane-bound adenylate cyclases (also known as class-III) [5,6] from
   mammals, slime mold or Drosophila. A consensus pattern was derived from the most conserved region
   in that domain. Consensus

  <p> 956. Hemolysin-type calcium-binding region signature (HemolysinCabinD) </p>
  <p>[1552] Gram-negative bacteria produce a number of proteins which are secreted into the growth
   medium by a mechanism that does not require a cleaved N-terminal signal sequence. These proteins,
   while having different functions, seem [1] to share two properties: they bind calcium and they
   contain a variable number of tandem repeats consisting of a nine amino acid motif rich in
   glycine, aspartic acid and asparagine. It has been shown [2] that such a domain is involved in
   the binding of calcium ions in a parallel beta roll structure. The proteins which are currently
   known to belong to this category are: Hemolysins from various species of bacteria. Bacterial
   hemolysins are exotoxins that attack blood cell membranes and cause cell rupture. The hemolysins
   which are known to contain such a domain are those from: E. coli (gene hlyA), A. pleuropneumoniae
   (gene appA), A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. haemolytica (leukotoxin) (gene lktA). Cyclolysin
   from Bordetella pertussis (gene cyaA). A multifunctional protein which is both an adenylate
   cyclase and a hemolysin. Extracellular zinc proteases: serralysin (EC 3.4.24.40) from Serratia,
   prtB and prtC from Erwinia chrysanthemi and aprA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Nodulation protein

  <p>[1555] IMP dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.205) (IMPDH) catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction of de novo
   GTP biosynthesis, the NAD-dependent reduction of IMP into XMP [1]. Inhibition of IMP
   dehydrogenase activity results in the cessation of DNA synthesis. As IMP dehydrogenase is
   associated with cell proliferation, it is a possible target for cancer chemotherapy. Mammalian
   and bacterial IMPDHs are tetramers of identical chains. There are two IMP dehydrogenase isozymes
   in humans [2]. </p>

   deamination of GMP into IMP [3]. It converts nucleobase, nucleoside and nucleotide derivatives of
   G to A nucleotides, and maintains intracellular balance of A and G nucleotides. IMP dehydrogenase
   and GMP reductase share many regions of sequence similarity. One of these regions is centered on

   not known but they may be involved in the attachment of nitrogen-fixing bacteria to legumes and
   in the protection against pathogens. Legume lectins bind calcium and manganese (or other
   transition metals). </p>
  <p>[1563] Legume lectins are synthesized as precursor proteins of about 230 to 260 amino acid
   residues. Some legume lectins are proteolytically processed to produce two chains: beta (which
   corresponds to the N-terminal) and alpha (C-terminal). The lectin concanavalin A (conA) from jack
   bean is exceptional in that the two chains are transposed and ligated (by formation of a new
   peptide bond). The N-terminus of mature conA thus corresponds to that of the alpha chain and the
   C-terminus to the beta chain. </p>
  <p>[1564] Two signature patterns were developed specific to legume lectins: the first is located
   in the C-terminal section of the beta chain and contains a conserved aspartic acid residue
   important for the binding of calcium and manganese; the second one is located in the N-terminal
   of the alpha chain. Consensus pattern [LIV]-[STAG]-V-[DEQV]-[FLI]-D-[ST] [D binds manganese and

  <p>[1565] Malate synthase (EC 4.1.3.2) catalyzes the aldol condensation of glyoxylate with
   acetyl-CoA to form malate - the second step of the glyoxylate bypass, an alternative to the
   tricarboxylic acid cycle in bacteria, fungi and plants. Malate synthase is a protein of 530 to
   570 amino acids whose sequence is highly conserved across species [1]. As a signature pattern, a

  <p> 970. DNA mismatch repair proteins mutS family signature (MutS_C) </p>
  <p>[1569] Mismatch repair contributes to the overall fidelity of DNA replication [1]. It involves
   the correction of mismatched base pairs that have been missed by the proofreading element of the
   DNA polymerase complex. The sequence of some proteins involved in mismatch repair in different
   organisms have been found to be evolutionary related [2,3]. One of these families is called mutS
   [4,E1], it consists of: Prokaroytic protein mutS protein (also called hexA in Streptococcus
   pneumoniae). Muts is thought to carry out the mismatch recognition step of DNA repair. Eukaryotic
   MSH1, which is involved in mitochondrial DNA repair. Eukaryotic MSH2, which is involved in
   nuclear postreplication mismatch repair. MSH2 heterodimerizes with MSH6. In man, MSH2 is involved
   in a form of familial hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). Eukaryotic MSH3, which is
   probably involved in the repair of large loops. Eukaryotic MSH4, which is involved in meiotic
   recombination. Eukaryotic MSH5, which is involved in meiotic recombination. Eukaryotic MSH6 (also
   known as G/T mismatch binding protein), a DNA-repair protein that binds to G/T mismatches through
   heterodimerization with MSH2. Prokaryotic protein mutS2 whose function is not yet known. A coral
   (Sarcophyton glaucum) mitochondrial encoded mutS-like protein. </p>
  <p>[1570] As a signature pattern for this class of mismatch repair proteins a region rich in
   glycine and negatively charged residues was selected This region is found in the C-terminal
   section of these proteins; about 80 residues to the C-terminal of an ATP-binding site motif'A'

  <p> 971. MutS family, N-terminal putative DNA binding domain (MutS_N) </p>
  <p>[1571] This family consists of the N-terminal region of proteins in the mutS family of DNA
   mismatch repair proteins and is found associated with MutS_C located in the C-terminal region.
   The mutS family of proteins is named after the salmonella typhimurium MutS protein involved in
   mismatch repair; other members of the family included the eukaryotic MSH 1,2,3,4,5 and 6
   proteins. These have various roles in DNA repair and recombination. Human MSH has been implicated
   in non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC) and is a mismatch binding protein [2]. The aligned
   region corresponds in part with domains A1, A2 (which may bind DNA) and B (which binds dsDNA in
   vitro) from T. thermophilus MutS as characterised in [1]. Number of members: 43 </p>

  <p> 973. Sodium and potassium ATPases beta subunits signatures (Na_K-ATPase) </p>
  <p>[1573] The sodium pump (Na+,K+ ATPase), located in the plasma membrane of all animal cells [1],
   is an heterotrimer of a catalytic subunit (alpha chain), a glycoprotein subunit of about 34 Kd
   (beta chain) and a small hydrophobic protein of about 6 Kd. The beta subunit seems [2] to
   regulate, through the assembly of alpha/beta heterodimers, the number of sodium pumps transported
   to the plasma membrane. </p>
  <p>[1574] Structurally the beta subunit is composed of a charged cytoplasmic domain of about 35
   residues, followed by a transmembrane region, and a large extracellular domain that contains
   three disulfide bonds and glycosylation sites. This structure is schematically represented in the
   figure below. EMI768.1 </p>
  <p>[1575] Two isoforms of the beta subunit (beta-1 and beta-2) are currently known; they share
   about 50% sequence identity. Gastric (K+, H+) ATPase (proton pump) responsible for acid
   production in the stomach consist of two subunits [3]; the beta chain is highly similar to the
   sodium pump beta subunits. Two signature patterns were developed for beta subunits. The first is
   located in the cytoplasmic domain, while the second is found in the extracellular domain and
   contains two of the cysteines involved in disulfide bonds. Consensus pattern

  <p> 974. Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 signatures (NADHdh) </p>
  <p>[1576] Respiratory-chain NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.5.3) [1,2] (also known as complex I or
   NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is an oligomeric enzymatic complex located in the inner
   mitochondrial membrane which also seems to exist in the chloroplast and in cyanobacteria (as a
   NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase). Among the 25 to 30 polypeptide subunits of this bioenergetic
   enzyme complex there are fifteen which are located in the membrane part, seven of which are
   encoded by the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of most species. The most conserved of these
   organelle-encoded subunits is known as subunit I (gene ND1 in mitochondrion, and NDH1 in
   chloroplast) and seems to contain the ubiquinone binding site. </p>
  <p>[1577] The ND1 subunit is highly similar to subunit 4 of Escherichia coli formate hydrogenlyase
   (gene hycD), subunit C of hydrogenase-4 (gene hyfC). Paracoccus denitrificans NQO8 and
   Escherichia coli nuoH NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits also belong to this family [3]. Two

  <p> 975. Nickel-dependent hydrogenases large subunit signatures (NiFeSe_Hases) </p>
  <p>[1578] Hydrogenases are enzymes that catalyze the reversible activation of hydrogen and which
   occur widely in prokaryotes as well as in some eukaryotes. There are various types of
   hydrogenases, but all of them seem to contain at least one iron-sulfur cluster. They can be
   broadly divided into two groups: hydrogenases containing nickel and, in some cases, also selenium
   (the [NiFe] and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases) and those lacking nickel (the [Fe] hydrogenases). </p>
  <p>[1579] The [NiFe] and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases are heterodimer that consist of a small subunit
   that contains a signal peptide and a large subunit. All the known large subunits seem to be
   evolutionary related [1]; they contain two Cys-x-x- Cys motifs; one at their N-terminal end; the
   other at their C-terminal end. These four cysteines are involved in the binding of nickel [2]. In
   the [NiFeSe] hydrogenases the first cysteine of the C-terminal motif is a selenocysteine which
   has experimentally been shown to be a nickel ligand [3]. Two patterns were developed which are
   centered on the Cys-x-x-Cys motifs. </p>
  <p>[1580] Alcaligenes eutrophus possess a NAD-reducing cytoplasmic hydrogenase (hoxS) [4]; this
   enzyme is composed of four subunits. Two of these subunits (beta and delta) are responsible for
   the hydrogenase reaction and are evolutionary related to the large and small subunits of
   membrane-bound hydrogenases. The alpha subunit of coenzyme F420 hydrogenase (EC 1.12.99.1) (FRH)
   from archaebacterial methanogens also belongs to this family. Consensus pattern

  <p> 990. P-II protein signatures </p>
  <p> PROSITE cross-reference(s): PS00496; PIT_GLNB_UMP, PS00638; PII_GLNB_CTER </p>
  <p>[1619] The P-II protein (gene glnB) is a bacterial protein important for the control of
   glutamine synthetase [1,2,3]. In nitrogen-limiting conditions, when the ratio of glutamine to
   2-ketoglutarate decreases, P-II is uridylylated on a tyrosine residue to form P-II-UMP. P-II-UMP
   allows the deadenylation of glutamine synthetase (GS), thus activating the enzyme. Conversely, in
   nitrogen excess, P-II-UMP is deuridylated and then promotes the adenylation of GS. P-II also
   indirectly controls the transcription of the GS gene (glnA) by preventing NR-II (ntrB) to
   phosphorylate NR-I (ntrC) which is the transcriptional activator of glnA. Once P-II is
   uridylylated, these events are reversed. </p>
  <p>[1620] P-II is a protein of about 110 amino acid residues extremely well conserved. The
   tyrosine which is urydylated is located in the central part of the protein. </p>
  <p>[1621] In cyanobacteria, P-II seems to be phosphorylated on a serine residue rather than being
   urydylated. </p>
  <p>[1622] In methanogenic archaebacteria, the nitrogenase iron protein gene (nifH) is followed by
   two open reading frames highly similar to the eubacterial P-II protein [4]. These proteins could
   be involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation. </p>
  <p>[1623] In the red alga, Porphyra purpurea, there is a glnB homolog encoded in the chloroplast
   genome. </p>
  <p>[1624] Other proteins highly similar to glnB are: Bacillus subtilis protein nrgB [5].
   Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybaI [6]. </p>
  <p>[1625] Two signature patterns were developed for P-II protein. The first one is a conserved
   stretch (in eubacteria) of six residues which contains the urydylated tyrosine, the other is
   derived from a conserved region in the C-terminal part of the P-II protein. Consensus

  <p> PROSITE cross-reference(s)PS00419; PHOTOSYSTEM_I_PSAAB </p>
  <p>[1628] Photosystem I (PSI) [1] is an integral membrane protein complex that uses light energy
   to mediate electron transfer from plastocyanin to ferredoxin. PSI is found in the chloroplast of
   plants and cyanobacteria. The electron transfer components of the reaction center of PSI are a
   primary electron donor P-700 (chlorophyll dimer) and five electron acceptors: A0 (chlorophyll),
   A1 (a phylloquinone) and three 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur centers: Fx, Fa, and Fb. </p>
  <p>[1629] PsaA and psaB, two closely related proteins, are involved in the binding of P700, A0,
   A1, and Fx. psaA and psaB are both integral membrane proteins of 730 to 750 amino acids that seem
   to contain 11 transmembrane segments. The Fx 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur center is bound by four
   cysteines; two of these cysteines are provided by the psaA protein and the two others by psaB.
   The two cysteines in both proteins are proximal and located in a loop between the ninth and tenth
   transmembrane segments. A leucine zipper motif seems to be present [2] downstream of the
   cysteines and could contribute to dimerization of psaA/psaB. </p>

   residues; there is a conserved ATP-binding site motif 'A' (P-loop) in the N-terminal section of
   the protein as well as two other conserved regions, one located in the central section, and the
   other in the C-terminal section. Signature patterns were derived from these two regions.

  <p>[1647] Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39) (RuBisCO) [1,2] catalyzes the initial
   step in Calvin's reductive pentose phosphate cycle in plants as well as purple and green
   bacteria. It consists of a large catalytic unit and a small subunit of undetermined function. In
   plants, the large subunit is coded by the chloroplastic genome while the small subunit is encoded
   in the nuclear genome. Molecular activation of RuBisCO by CO2 involves the formation of a
   carbamate with the epsilon-amino group of a conserved lysine residue. This carbamate is
   stabilized by a magnesium ion. One of the ligands of the magnesium ion is an aspartic acid
   residue close to the active site lysine [3]. A pattern was developed which includes both the
   active site residue and the metal ligand, and which is specific to RuBisCO large chains.

   domain Integrase_Zn. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain
   that is a non-specific DNA binding domain integrase. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease
   when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse
   transcription. This domain also catalyses the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the

  <p> PROSITE: PDOC00798. PROSITE cross-reference(s) PS01039; SBP_BACTERIAL_3 </p>
  <p>[1649] Bacterial high affinity transport systems are involved in active transport of solutes
   across the cytoplasmic membrane. The protein components of these traffic systems include one or
   two transmembrane protein components, one or two membrane-associated ATP-binding proteins (ABC
   transporters; see &lt;PDOC00185&gt;) and a high affinity periplasmic solute-binding protein. The
   later are thought to bind the substrate in the vicinity of the inner membrane, and to transfer it
   to a complex of inner membrane proteins for concentration into the cytoplasm. </p>
  <p>[1650] In gram-positive bacteria which are surrounded by a single membrane and have therefore
   no periplasmic region the equivalent proteins are bound to the membrane via an N-terminal lipid
   anchor. These homolog proteins do not play an integral role in the transport process per se, but
   probably serve as receptors to trigger or initiate translocation of the solute throught the
   membrane by binding to external sites of the integral membrane proteins of the efflux system. </p>
  <p>[1651] In addition at least some solute-binding proteins function in the initiation of sensory
   transduction pathways. </p>
  <p>[1652] On the basis of sequence similarities, the vast majority of these solute-binding
   proteins can be grouped [1] into eight families of clusters, which generally correlate with the
   nature of the solute bound. </p>
  <p>[1653] Family 3 groups together specific amino acids and opine-binding periplasmic proteins and
   a periplasmic homolog with catalytic activity: Histidine-binding protein (gene hisJ) of
   Escherichia coli and related bacteria. An homologous lipoprotein exists in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
   Lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding proteins (LAO) (gene argT) of Escherichia coli and related
   bacteria are involved in the same transport system than hisJ. Both solute-binding proteins
   interact with a common membrane-bound receptor hisP of the binding protein dependent transport

  <p>[1670] Urease (EC 3.5.1.5) is a nickel-binding enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to
   carbon dioxide and ammonia [1]. Historically, it was the first enzyme to be crystallized (in
   1926). It is mainly found in plant seeds, microorganisms and invertebrates. In plants, urease is
   a hexamer of identical chains. In bacteria [2], it consists of either two or three different
   subunits (alpha, beta and gamma). </p>
  <p>[1671] Urease binds two nickel ions per subunit; four histidine, an aspartate and a
   carbamated-lysine serve as ligands to these metals; an additional histidine is involved in the
   catalytic mechanism [3]. </p>
  <p>[1672] As signatures for this enzyme, a region that contains two histidine that bind one of the
   nickel ions and the region of the active site histidine was selected. </p>

   well as V-type ATP synthase subunit i. The V-type ATPases family are proton pumps that acidify
   intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells for example yeast central vacuoles,
   clathrin-coated and synaptic vesicles. They have important roles in membrane trafficking
   processes [1]. The 116kDa subunit (subunit a) in the V-type ATPase is part of the VO functional
   domain responsible for proton transport. The a subunit is a transmembrane glycoprotein with
   multiple putative transmembrane helices t has a hydrophilic amino terminal and a hydrophobic

  <p> 1031. WW/rsp5/WWP domain signature and profile. Cross-reference(s): PS01159; </p>
  <p> WW_DOMAIN_1; PS50020; WW_DOMAIN_2 </p>
  <p>[1681] The WW domain [1-4,E1] (also known as rsp5 or WWP) has been originally discovered as a
   short conserved region in a number of unrelated proteins, among them dystrophin, the gene
   responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The domain, which spans about 35 residues, is
   repeated up to 4 times in some proteins. It has been shown [5] to bind proteins with particular
   proline-motifs, [AP]-P-P-[AP]-Y, and thus resembles somewhat SH3 domains. It appears to contain
   beta-strands grouped around four conserved aromatic positions; generally Trp. The name WW or WWP
   derives from the presence of these Trp as well as that of a conserved Pro. It is frequently
   associated with other domains typical for proteins in signal transduction processes. </p>
  <p>[1682] Proteins containing the WW domain are listed below. Dystrophin, a multidomain
   cytoskeletal protein. Its longest alternatively spliced form consists of an N-terminal
   actin-binding domain, followed by 24 spectrin-like repeats, a cysteine-rich calcium-binding
   domain and a C-terminal globular domain. Dystrophin form tetramers and is thought to have
   multiple functions including involvement in membrane stability, transduction of contractile
   forces to the extracellular environment and organization of membrane specialization. Mutations in
   the dystrophin gene lead to muscular dystrophy of Duchenne or Becker type. Dystrophin contains
   one WW domain C-terminal of the spectrin-repeats. Utrophin, a dystrophin-like protein of unknown
   function. Vertebrate YAP protein is a substrate of an unknown serine kinase. It binds to the SH3
   domain of the Yes oncoprotein via a proline-rich region. This protein appears in alternatively
   spliced isoforms, containing either one or two WW domains [6]. Mouse NEDD-4 plays a role in the
   embryonic development and differentiation of the central nervous system. It contains 3 WW modules
   followed by a HECT domain. The human ortholog contains 4 WW domains, but the third WW domain is
   probably spliced resulting in an alternate NEDD-4 protein with only 3 WW modules [3]. Yeast RSP5
   is similar to NEDD-4 in its molecular organization. It contains an N-terminal C2 domain (see
   &lt;PDOC00380&gt;), followed by a histidine-rich region, 3 WW domains and a HECT domain. Rat
   FE65, a transcription-factor activator expressed preferentially in liver. The activator domain is
   located within the N-terminal 232 residues of FE65, which also contain the WW domain. Yeast
   ESS1/PTF1, a putative peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase from family ppiC (see
   &lt;PDOC00840&gt;). A related protein, dodo (gene dod) exists in Drosophila and in mammals (gene
   PIN1). Tobacco DB10 protein. The WW domain is located N-terminal to the region with similarity to
   ATP-dependent RNA helicases. IQGAP, a human GTPase activating protein acting on ras. It contains
   an N-terminal domain similar to fly muscle mp20 protein and a C-terminal ras GTPase activator
   domain. Yeast pre-mRNA processing protein PRP40, Caenorhabditis elegans ZK1098.1 and fission
   yeast SpAC13C5.02 are related proteins with similarity to MYO2-type myosin, each containing two
   WW-domains at the N-terminus. Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C38D4.5, which contains
   one WW module, a PH domain (see &lt;PDOC50003&gt;) and a C-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
   domain. Yeast hypothetical protein YFL010c. </p>
  <p>[1683] For the sensitive detection of WW domains, a profile was developed which spans the whole
   homology region as well as a pattern. </p>

  <p> 1032. XPA protein signatures. cross-reference(s): XPA_1 PROSITE PS00752; PS00753;XPA_2. </p>
  <p>[1685] Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) [1] is a human autosomal recessive disease, characterized by
   a high incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancer. People's skin cells with this condition are
   hypersensitive to ultraviolet light, due to defects in the incision step of DNA excision repair.
   There are a minimum of seven genetic complementation groups involved in this pathway: XP-A to
   XP-G. XP-A is the most severe form of the disease and is due to defects in a 30 Kd nuclear
   protein called XPA (or XPAC) [2]. </p>
  <p>[1686] The sequence of the XPA protein is conserved from higher eukaryotes [3] to yeast (gene
   RAD14) [4]. XPA is a hydrophilic protein of 247 to 296 amino-acid residues which has a C4-type
   zinc finger motif in its central section. </p>
  <p>[1687] Two signature were developed patterns for XPA proteins. The first corresponds to the
   zinc finger region, the second to a highly conserved region located some 12 residues after the
   zinc finger region. Consensus patternC-x-[DE]-C-x(3)-[LIVMF]-x(1,2)-D-x(2)-L-x(3)-F-x(4)-C-x(2)-C

   Asparaginase II catalyzes the reaction of L-Asparagine + H2O = L-Aspartate + NH3. As many
   leukemias have high requirements for aspartic acid, asparaginase II proteins are useful as
   reagents for screening compounds for activity as leukemia chemotherapy products. Asparaginase II
   protein can also be over- or under-expressed to alter amino acid content in plant tissues or to

  <p> C. DMRL synthase </p>
  <p>[1693] DMRL Synthase (6,7-Dimethyl-8-Ribityllumazine Synthase) catalyzes the last step in

   3H)-Pyrimidinedione with L-3,4-Dihydroxy-2-Butanone 4-Phosphate producing
   6,7-Dimethyl-8-(1-D-Ribityl)Luminazine. The enzyme forms a homopentamer. Engineering of these
   proteins or those with homologous sequences/structures may allow control of the amounts of
   vitamin B2 available in plants and/or accumulation of pigment, as well as altering reactions

  <p> D. E1_N </p>
  <p>[1694] These proteins are ATP-dependent DNA helicases that are required for initiation of viral
   DNA replication. They form a complex with the viral E2 protein. The E1-E2 complex binds to the
   replication origin that contains binding sites for both proteins. The majority of sequences known
   for this group of proteins are from various papillomaviruses, a type of double stranded DNA
   virus. In plants, the prototype double stranded DNA virus is Cauliflower Mosaic virus (CaMV).
   Manipulation of these proteins, especially to produce variant proteins that form non-productive
   complexes, enables production of plants that are resistant to infection by double stranded DNA
   viruses. Ref: <ref type="npl">Yang et al. (1993) PNAS USA 90: 5086-90</ref> <ref type="npl">Ustav and Stenlund (1991) EMBO J 10: 449-57</ref>

  <p>[1695] Elongation Factor-1 is composed of four subunits: alpha, beta, delta and gamma. Gamma
   subunits are presumed to play a role in anchoring the complex to other cellular components.
   Studies of EF-1 genes in plants suggests that different forms of the EF-1 subunits may be
   expressed in particular organs or in response to stress. Manipulation of the activity of these
   proteins, either by altered expression level or by structural mutation, may result in the
   accumulation of a particular protein in a chosen organ or allow production of particular proteins
   during stress conditions. Ref: <ref type="npl">Kinzy et al. (1994) NAR 22: 2703-7</ref> <ref type="npl">Dunn et al. (1993) Plant Mol

  <p> F. ENV_polyprotein </p>
  <p>[1696] This family comprises the envelope or coat proteins known from a number of different
   retroviruses. In mammalian species, retroviruses are responsible for diseases such as leukemia
   and HIV. In plants, retroviruses are known in both monocot (e.g. Zeon-1) and dicot (e.g.
   Arabidopsis and tobacco) species and have been shown to induce mutant alleles at new loci.
   Engineering of plant ENV proteins may allow mobilization or targeting of endogenous or introduced
   retroviruses, in essence generating a new method for mutant production, gene tagging and the
   like. Ref: <ref type="npl">Mamoun et al (1990) J Virol 64: 4180-8</ref> <ref type="npl">Grandbastien et al. (1989) Nature 337: 376-80</ref>

  <p>[1697] Proteins having this domain (previously known as the glycosyl hydrolase family 5 domain)
   catalyze the endohydrolysis of 1,4- beta -D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose. Numerous plant
   proteins with this domain exist and are expressed in an organ specific manner. They are involved
   in the fruit ripening process, in cell elongation and plant reproduction. Modulation of the
   activity of these proteins, either by over- or under-expression or by mutation of the
   polypeptide, could be used to affect post-harvest physiology (e.g. rate of ripening) or for
   engineering reproductive sterility. Ref: <ref type="npl">Giorda et al. (1990) Biochemistry 29: 7264-9</ref> <ref type="npl">Tucker et

  <p> H. Glycosyl_hydr14 </p>
  <p>[1698] The beta -amylases (family 14 of glycosyl hydrolases) catalyze the hydrolysis of 1,4-
   alpha -glucosidic linkages in polysaccharides and remove successive maltose units from the
   non-reducing ends of the chains. Mutants of beta -amylase in Arabidopsis exhibited altered
   degradation of starch throughout the diurnal cycle. In addition, the mutant phenotypes indicated
   that these enzymes not only affect carbohydrate metabolism/catabolism, but also influence the
   amount of pigment stored within particular cells. Manipulation of the beta -amylase genes enables
   control of plant pigmentation (for example, fibre pigment in cotton) as well as carbohydrate
   synthesis and degradation. Ref: <ref type="npl">Zeeman et al. (1998) Plant J 15: 357-65</ref> <ref type="npl">Hirano and Nakamura

  <p> I. Glycosyl_hydr15 </p>
  <p>[1699] Glycosyl hydrolases from family 15 (such as 1,4-Alpha-D-Glucan glucohydrolase,) catalyze
   the hydrolysis of terminal 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues successively from the non-reducing
   ends of the chains resulting in the release of beta -D-Glucose. In plants these proteins have
   been tied to the mobilization of the xyloglucan stored in the cotyledonary cell walls. Proteins
   such as these could be varied to affect the rate of plant growth (for example during
   germination), storage and/or use of glucose and other sugars by plant tissues and alteration of
   the properties, such as elasticity, of plant cell walls. Ref: <ref type="npl">Crombie et al. (1998) Plant J 15:

  <p> J. Glycosyl_hydr20 </p>
  <p>[1700] Members of the family 20 glycosyl hydrolases catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal
   non-reducing N-acetly-D-hexosamine residues in N-acetyl- beta -D-hexosaminides. N-acetyl- beta
   -glucosaminidase belongs to this family and exists in several different forms (consisting of
   various combinations of alpha and beta chains) depending on the organism. Family 20 glycosyl
   hydrolases have been implicated in lysosomal storage diseases (such as Sandhoff disease) and
   glycogen storage disease in humans. These types of proteins are also responsible for the
   hydrolysis of chitin. In plants, these proteins could be useful in controlling carbohydrate
   catabolism, thereby influencing the amount of sugars available for storage and/or use in other
   metabolic pathways. In addition, it is possible that such proteins could be used to engineer an
   endogenous insect protection mechanism, e.g. by secretion of a chitin-hydrolyzing composition by
   the plant. Ref: <ref type="npl">Graham et al (1988) J Biol Chem 263: 16823-9</ref> <ref type="npl">O'Dowd et al. (1988) Biochemistry

  <p> K. HMG box </p>
  <p>[1701] The HMG box is a novel type of DNA-binding domain found in a diverse group of proteins.
   Numerous plant proteins contain this domain, such as the HMG1/2-like proteins. The expression of
   some of these HMG proteins appears to be regulated by circadian rhythms and in a light dependent
   manner, occurring at higher levels in roots, for example and lower levels in light-grown tissues
   such as cotyledons. Generally, HMG proteins are thought to influence transcription regulation. In
   plants, HMGs are believed to have a role in maintaining patterns of circadian-regulated
   expression for other genes, suggesting that these proteins could be exploited to control growth
   and development. Ref: <ref type="npl">Laudet et al. (1993) Nucleic Acids Res 21: 2493-501</ref> <ref type="npl">Zheng et al. (1993)

  <p> L. IL2 </p>
  <p>[1702] Interleukin-2 (IL-2)is produced in mammals by T cells in response to antigenic or
   mitogenic stimulation and is crucial for proper regulation and functioning of the immune
   response. IL-2 is capable of stimulating B cells, monocytes, lymphokine-activated killer cells,
   natural killer cells and glioma cells. Plant extracts have also been shown to stimulate the
   immune system (for example, mistletoe therapy for human cancer). It is known that IL-2 is
   involved in feedback inhibition pathways that impact the inflammatory response as well as the
   growth inhibition of tumor reactive T cells. Plant proteins containing IL-2-like sequences are
   useful as immunity-based therapeutics, acting in a manner similar to IL-2 in mammals. Ref: <ref type="npl">Heike

  <p> M. Oxidored_FMN </p>
  <p>[1703] NADPH dehydrogenases catalyze the reaction NADPH + acceptor = NADP(+) + reduced
   acceptor. One member of this family is yeast &quot;old yellow enzyme&quot; (OYE) and is thought
   to be involved in oxylipin metabolism. A second yeast family member is a protein that binds
   estrogen binding protein (EBP) in addition to exhibiting oxidoreductase activity. An Arabidopsis
   homolog to OYE has been described and estrogen binding proteins in plants have been reported.
   Plant proteins from this class have the potential to be used to modify lipid
   metabolism/catabolism. These proteins may also have use as therapeutics for breast and prostate
   cancer, and other abnormal growth in steroid-sensitive tissues. Ref: <ref type="npl">Baker et al. (1998) Proc Soc

  <p> N. Oxidored_q2 </p>
  <p>[1704] The NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductases catalyze the reaction NADH + plastoquinone =
   NAD(+) + plastoquinol. In plants these reactions occur in the chloroplast and are believed to
   participate in a chloroplast respiratory system. Here, the NDH complex is postulated to act as a
   valve to remove excess reduction equivalents in the chloroplasts. Manipulation of these proteins
   may improve the rate or efficiency of photosynthesis. Ref: <ref type="npl">Burrows et al. (1998) EMBO J 17:

  <p> O. PABP </p>
  <p>[1705] Polyadenylate binding proteins bind the poly (A) tail of mRNA. Plants, as exemplified by
   Arabidopsis, contain numerous PABP genes that are expressed in an organ-specific manner. For
   example, PABP2 is functional in roots and shoots, while PABP5 is expressed predominantly in
   immature flowers. The PABP proteins are implicated in numerous aspects of posttranscriptional
   regulation including mRNA turnover and translational initiation. Control of activity of PABP
   proteins provides the ability to control the expression of various genes in particular organs
   during development. Ref: <ref type="npl">Hilson et al (1993) Plant Physiol 103: 525-33</ref> <ref type="npl">Belostotsky and Meagher

  <p> P. Parvo coat </p>
  <p>[1706] Parvoviruses are linear single-stranded DNA viruses that are encapsulated by three
   capsid proteins. Plants are susceptible to infection by single stranded DNA viruses such as Maize
   streak virus (MSV) and various Gemini viruses. The coat proteins in these plant viruses are
   critical to the virus life cycle within the plant. For example, the coat protein of MSV is
   thought to be involved in intra- and inter-cellular movement within the plant. Engineering of
   proteins having similarity to parvoviral coat proteins, especially to produce proteins that
   interfere with maturation of the virus particle, enables the production of plants having better
   resistance to natural plant single-stranded DNA viruses. Ref: <ref type="npl">Liu et al. (1997) J Gen Virol 78:

  <p> O. Pkinase_C </p>
  <p>[1707] Plant serine/threonine protein kinases possessing this domain are expressed in all
   tissues and are known to undergo serine-specific autophosphorylation and specifically
   phosphorylate two ribosomal proteins, P14 and P16. During development, these proteins predominate
   during high metabolic activity in growing buds, root tips, leaf margins and germinating seeds.
   They are thought to be involved in the control of plant growth and development. In addition, two
   genes encoding proteins from this family have been described that help plant cells adapt during
   cold or high salt stresses. Consequently, engineering Pkinase C proteins provides a way to
   control general growth/development of the plant as well as a means to provide endogenous
   protection against environmental stresses. Ref: <ref type="npl">Zhang et al. (1994) J Biol Chem 269: 17586-92</ref>

  <p> R. REV </p>
  <p>[1708] The REV proteins act post-transcriptionally to relieve negative repression of GAG and
   ENV production in retroviruses such as Human Immounodeficiency Virus type I (HIV-1). Plants
   contain retrovirus-like viruses such as pararetroviruses and retrotransposons (i.e. transposons
   having long terminal repeats). Plant retrotransposons in particular have been used to create
   mutations at various loci, thereby permitting gene isolation, gene tagging and the like.
   Manipulation of plant REV proteins enables control of transposition frequencies of corresponding
   transposable elements and provides a new tool for genetic engineering of plants. Ref: <ref type="npl">Sodroski et

  <p> S. RuBisCo small </p>
  <p>[1709] Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) catalyzes the initial step in
   the C3 photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle, adding carbon dioxide to D-ribulose
   1,5-bisphosphate to form two molecules of 3-phospho-D-glycerate. RuBisCo is comprised of two
   subunits, one large which is synthesized in the chloroplast, and one small which is synthesized
   in the cytoplasm and then transported in to the chloroplast. The expression of the small subunit
   of RuBisCo is light regulated. Manipulation of these proteins could increase the efficiency of
   photosynthesis or allow alterations in developmental timing. Ref: <ref type="npl">Giuliano et al. (1988) PNAS USA

  <p> T. Sialyltransf </p>
  <p>[1710] Members of the CMP-N-acetylneuraminate- beta -galactosamide- alpha
   -2,3-sialyltransferase family catalyze the following reaction: CMP-N-acetylneuraminate + beta
   -D-galactosyl-1,3-N-acetyl- alpha -D-galactosaminyl-R = CMP + alpha -N-acetylneraminyl-2,3- beta
   -D-galactosyl-1,3-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl-R. These proteins are though to be responsible
   for the synthesis of the sequence neurac- alpha -2,3-gal- beta -1,3-galnac- found on sugar chains
   )-linked to threonine or serine and also as a terminal sequence on certain gangliosides in
   mammalian cells. In plants, glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus synthesize cell wall
   polysaccharides and elaborate the complex glycans of glycoproteins. Engineering of plant
   sialyltransferases allows targeting of proteins to particular cellular locations or enables the
   making of changes in cell wall structure. Ref: <ref type="npl">Wee et al. (1998) Plant Cell 10: 1759-68</ref> <ref type="npl">Lee et

  <p> U. Signal </p>
  <p>[1711] Many plant proteins in this family contain sequences similar to those found in both
   components of the prokaryotic family of signal transducers known as the two-component systems.
   This suggests that activation may require a transfer of a phosphate group between the transmitter
   domain and the receiver domain. One family member in Arabidopsis appears to be involved in
   ethylene (a plant hormone) signal transduction. Other proteins in this family appear to be
   involved in the regulation of gene transcription under conditions of environmental stress. Signal
   proteins can be exploited to affect plant growth and development and/or control plant responses
   to stress conditions such as cold, nutrient availability, etc. Ref: <ref type="npl">Chang et al. (1993) Science

  <p> V. vMSA </p>
  <p>[1712] vMSA proteins are major surface antigens presenting on the envelope of various
   retroviruses. Surface antigens of retroviruses are often involved in tropism of the virus. Plants
   contain retrovirus-like viruses such as pararetroviruses and retrotransposons (i.e. transposons
   having long terminal repeats). Plant retrotransposons in particular have been used to create
   mutants at various loci, thereby permitting gene isolation, gene tagging and the like.
   Manipulation of plant vMSA proteins enables control of tropism of plant retroviruses that might
   be used for genetic engineering tools, thus enabling targeting of the virus to particular species
   and/or tissues of plants. Ref: <ref type="npl">Okamoto et al. (1988) J Gen Virol 69: 2575-83</ref> <ref type="npl">Grandbastien et al.

  <p> W. zf-CCCH </p>
  <p>[1713] This family of proteins is defined by having two CX(8)CX(5)CX(3)H-type zinc finger
   domains. These proteins cover a broad range of functions. For example, the COP1 protein acts as a
   repressor of photomorphogenesis in darkness; light stimuli abolish this suppressive action. In
   addition, COP1 protein can function as a negative transcriptional regulator capable of direct
   interaction with components of the G-protein signaling pathway. As a second example, a zf-CCCH
   protein identified in Arabidopsis appears to be involved in the resistance to DNA damage induced
   by UV light and chemical DNA-damaging agents. Overexpression of this class of proteins permits
   production of plants that are better suited to adverse environments. Manipulation of expression
   of zf-CCCH proteins functioning as transcriptional regulators, such as COP1, enables manipulation
   of some signal transduction pathways. Ref: <ref type="npl">Pang et al. (1993) Nucleic Acids Res 21: 1647-53</ref> <ref type="npl">Deng

  <p> X. zf-RanBP </p>
  <p>[1714] Proteins falling within this category contain many X-X-F-G and X-F-X-F-G repeats, and
   may contain RANBP1-like or PPIase domains. Plant proteins having domains similar to these include
   PAS1 and GMSTI. PAS1 has been shown to have dramatic developmental affects that appear to be
   correlated with both cell division and cell wall elongation. GMSTI has high identity to the yeast
   STI stress-inducible gene and has been shown to be heat inducible. Proteins such as these may be
   useful for controlling growth and form of development. Ref: <ref type="npl">Vittorioso et al. (1998) Mol Cell

  <p> Y. Peptidase M48. </p>
  <p>[1715] Proteins belonging to this peptidase family are metalloproteases that bind zinc as a
   cofactor and are located in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. They function in
   NH2-terminal proteolytic processing, as shown for the yeast STE24 gene product. This gene is
   required for the correct processing of alpha -factor, a yeast pheromone. Family M48 peptidases
   also appear to be required for some prenylation reactions, mediating COOH-terminal CAAX
   processing. Prenylation reactions are believed to be involved in the regulation of
   protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions. As an example, RAS GTPase activity is
   regulated in part by localization to the inner side of the plasma membrane upon prenylation. In
   plants, proteins from this family could be involved in pollen-stigma interactions such as those
   mediating self-pollenation vs. outcrossing, or could be members of several secondary metabolism
   pathways. Ref: <ref type="npl">Fujimura-Kamada et al. (1997) J Cell Biol. 136: 271-85</ref>. <ref type="npl">Tam et al. (1998) J Cell

  <p> Z. DNA Pol Viral N </p>
  <p>[1716] The DNA pol Viral N domain is located at the N-terminal region of DNA polymerase
   isolated from several retroid viruses such as the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus. The domain motif has
   also been found in numerous other species from humans to cyanobacteria. In these organisms, this
   motif seems to be associated with two types of sequences; retrotransposons and mitochondrial
   genes. In the mitochondrial sequences this domain is potentially involved in the self-splicing
   conducted by group II introns. Various manipulations of this gene in plants allows control of the
   numerous retrotransposons endogenous to plant genomes or allows engineering of mitochondrial
   function, especially to increase efficiency of energy utilization by cells. REF: <ref type="npl">Chapdelaine and

  <p> Aa. Calpain_inhib </p>
  <p>[1717] This domain is found in calpastatin, an inhibitor protein specific for calpain. Calpain
   is a non-lysosomal calcium-dependent intracellular protease that appears to be involved in the
   dynamic changes of the cytoskeleton, especially actin-related structures, during early Drosophila
   embryogenesis [1]. Calpastatins co-exist in cells with calpains and the subcellular distribution
   of calpastatin is thought to be important to calpain regulation [2]. In plants calpains and
   calpastatins could be involved in embryogenesis and non-embryogenic organ reiteration. Mutations
   occurring in calpain inhibitor repeat domains would produce developmental abnormalities such as
   abnormal leaf, root or flower development. Refs 1 <ref type="npl">Emori Y and Saigo K (1994) J Biol Chem 269:

  <p> Ab. chorismate_bind </p>
  <p>[1718] Chorismate binding domains are present in plant anthranilate synthase (AS) genes. AS
   genes catalyze the first step in the biosynthesis of tryptophan by converting chorismate and
   L-glutamine to anthranilate, pyruvate and L-glutamate. Some of these genes are involved in
   feedback inhibition by tryptophan [1] while some are feedback insensitive [2]. In Arabidopsis,
   two AS genes have overlapping, but different distributions. One of these AS genes is induced by
   wounding and bacterial pathogen infiltration [1]. Mutations in the chorismate binding domain
   would affect the production of tryptophan and could influence the plant's defense system. AS gene
   products can be used for in vitro synthesis of tryptophan and tryptophan derivatives. Refs 1

  <p>[1719] Papillomaviruses are encapsulated double stranded DNA viruses. Plants are susceptible to

   proteins in these plant viruses are critical to the virus life cycle within the plant. For
   example, the coat protein of CaMV is thought to be involved in intra- and inter-cellular movement
   within the plant [1]. Engineering of proteins having similarity to papillomavirus coat proteins
   may enable the production of plants having better resistance to natural plant double stranded DNA
   viruses. Refs 1 <ref type="npl">Thompson SR, Melcher U (1993) J Gen Virol 74: 1141-8</ref>. </p>
  <p> Ad. Peptidase_M41 </p>
  <p>[1720] Proteins belonging to this peptidase family are metalloproteases that bind zinc as a
   cofactor and are integral membrane proteins. They seem to be involved in the degradation of
   carboxy-terminal-tagged cytoplasmic proteins. In plants, these proteins are located in the
   thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts, their expression is light regulated and they are thought
   to be involved in degradation of soluble stromal proteins and turn-over of thylkoid proteins [1].
   Manipulation of expression and structure of these proteins would have effects on the efficiency
   of photosynthesis and the development of chloroplasts. Refs 1 <ref type="npl">Lindahl M, Tabak s, Cseke L,

  <p>[1721] There is some evidence that, in plants, proteins in this family are involved in ATP

  <p> Af. E7 </p>
  <p>[1722] Papillomaviruses are encapsulated double stranded DNA viruses. The Papillomavirus early
   protein 7 (E7) is known as a potent immortalizing and transforming agent. Transformation by E7 is
   thought to be mediated by the physical association of E7 with cellular proteins regulating entry
   into the cell cycle [1]. The result is entry into the cell cycle and suppression of terminal
   differentiation in mammalian cells. Thus, engineering of proteins having similarity to
   papillomavirus E7 protein enables the production of plants having altered cellular proliferation
   characteristics and possibly altered morphology. For example, overexpression of E7-like proteins
   would be expected to result in proliferation of cells of the tissue in which the E7 protein is
   expressed, perhaps with suppression of differentiation events. Thus, for example, overexpression
   of E7-like proteins in meristem cells can result in taller plants and suppression of leafing
   and/or flowering. Refs 1 <ref type="npl">Zwerschke W, Jansen-Durr P Adv Cancer Res 2000;78:1-29</ref> </p>

  <p>[1723] This protein is known to be an integral membrane protein in the cyanobacterium
   Synechocystis where it functions to digest cleaved signal peptides [1]. This activity is
   necessary to maintain proper secretion of mature proteins across the membrane. In higher plants
   this protein may be present in the plastid or chloroplast membranes where it would function by
   enabling protein movement into and out of the chloroplasts. Mutations in this protein would be
   expected to affect the development of plastids, including chloroplasts, or alter the energy
   transfer system within the chloroplasts, thereby affecting growth and development. Refs 1 <ref type="npl">Kaneko

   also includes a domain that interacts with the mismatch repair protein MSH2. The 5'-3'
   exonuclease domain is also present in XPG DNA repair enzymes in humans and in yeast RAD9 protein.
   Defects in XPG proteins result in Xeroderma Pigmentosum. Thus defects in 5'-3' exonuclease

  <p> AA. Activities of Polypeptides Comprising Signal Peptides </p>
  <p>[1725] Polypeptides comprising signal peptides are a family of proteins that are typically
   targeted to (1) a particular organelle or intracellular compartment, (2) interact with a
   particular molecule or (3) for secretion outside of a host cell. Example of polypeptides
   comprising signal peptides include, without limitation, secreted proteins, soluble proteins,
   receptors, proteins retained in the ER, etc. </p>
  <p>[1726] These proteins comprising signal peptides are useful to modulate ligand-receptor
   interactions, cell-to-cell communication, signal transduction, intracellular communication, and
   activities and/or chemical cascades that take part in an organism outside or within of any
   particular cell. </p>
  <p>[1727] One class of such proteins are soluble proteins which are transported out of the cell.
   These proteins can act as ligands that bind to receptor to trigger signal transduction or to
   permit communication between cells. </p>
  <p>[1728] Another class is receptor proteins which also comprise a retention domain that lodges
   the receptor protein in the membrane when the cell transports the receptor to the surface of the
   cell. Like the soluble ligands, receptors can also modulate signal transduction and communication
   between cells. </p>
  <p>[1729] In addition the signal peptide itself can serve as a ligand for some receptors. An
   example is the interaction of the ER targeting signal peptide with the signal recognition
   particle (SRP). Here, the SRP binds to the signal peptide, halting translation, and the resulting
   SRP complex then binds to docking proteins located on the surface of the ER, prompting transfer
   of the protein into the ER. </p>
  <p>[1730] A description of signal peptide residue composition is described below in Subsection
   IV.C.1. </p>
  <p> III. Methods of Modulating Polypeptide Production </p>
  <p>[1731] It is contemplated that polynucleotides of the invention can be incorporated into a host
   cell or in-vitro system to modulate polypeptide production. For instance, the SDFs prepared as
   described herein can be used to prepare expression cassettes useful in a number of techniques for
   suppressing or enhancing expression. </p>
  <p>[1732] An example are polynucleotides comprising sequences to be transcribed, such as coding
   sequences, of the present invention can be inserted into nucleic acid constructs to modulate
   polypeptide production. Typically, such sequences to be transcribed are heterologous to at least
   one element of the nucleic acid construct to generate a chimeric gene or construct. </p>
  <p>[1733] Another example of useful polynucleotides are nucleic acid molecules comprising
   regulatory sequences of the present invention. Chimeric genes or constructs can be generated when
   the regulatory sequences of the invention linked to heterologous sequences in a vector construct.
   Within the scope of invention are such chimeric gene and/or constructs. </p>
  <p>[1734] Also within the scope of the invention are nucleic acid molecules, whereof at least a
   part or fragment of these DNA molecules are presented in TABLE 1 of the present application, and
   wherein the coding sequence is under the control of its own promoter and/or its own regulatory
   elements. Such molecules are useful for transforming the genome of a host cell or an organism
   regenerated from said host cell for modulating polypeptide production. </p>
  <p>[1735] Additionally, a vector capable of producing the oligonucleotide can be inserted into the
   host cell to deliver the oligonucleotide. </p>
  <p>[1736] More detailed description of components to be included in vector constructs are
   described both above and below. </p>
  <p>[1737] Whether the chimeric vectors or native nucleic acids are utilized, such polynucleotides
   can be incorporated into a host cell to modulate polypeptide production. Native genes and/or
   nucleic acid molecules can be effective when exogenous to the host cell. </p>
  <p>[1738] Methods of modulating polypeptide expression includes, without limitation: Suppression
   methods, such as Antisense Ribozymes Co-suppression Insertion of Sequences into the Gene to be
   Modulated Regulatory Sequence Modulation. as well as Methods for Enhancing Production, such as
   Insertion of Exogenous Sequences; and Regulatory Sequence Modulation. </p>
  <p> III.A. Suppression </p>
  <p>[1739] Expression cassettes of the invention can be used to suppress expression of endogenous
   genes which comprise the SDF sequence. Inhibiting expression can be useful, for instance, to
   tailor the ripening characteristics of a fruit (<ref type="npl">Oeller et al., Science 254:437 (1991)</ref>) or to
   influence seed size_(<ref type="pl">WO98/07842</ref>) or to provoke cell ablation (<ref type="npl">Mariani et
   al., Nature 357: 384-387 (1992)</ref>. </p>
  <p>[1740] As described above, a number of methods can be used to inhibit gene expression in
   plants, such as antisense, ribozyme, introduction of exogenous genes into a host cell, insertion
   of a polynucleotide sequence into the coding sequence and/or the promoter of the endogenous gene
   of interest, and the like. </p>
  <p> III.A.1. Antisense </p>
  <p>[1741] An expression cassette as described above can be transformed into host cell or plant to
   produce an antisense strand of RNA. For plant cells, antisense RNA inhibits gene expression by
   preventing the accumulation of mRNA which encodes the enzyme of interest, see, e.g., <ref type="npl">Sheehy et
   al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:8805 (1988)</ref>, and Hiatt et al., <ref type="pl">U.S. Patent No.
    4,801,340</ref>. </p>
  <p> III.A.2. Ribozymes </p>
  <p>[1742] Similarly, ribozyme constructs can be transformed into a plant to cleave mRNA and
   down-regulate translation. </p>
  <p> III.A.3. Co-Suppression </p>
  <p>[1743] Another method of suppression is by introducing an exogenous copy of the gene to be
   suppressed. Introduction of expression cassettes in which a nucleic acid is configured in the
   sense orientation with respect to the promoter has been shown to prevent the accumulation of
   mRNA. A detailed description of this method is described above. </p>
  <p> III.A.4. Insertion of Sequences into the Gene to be Modulated </p>
  <p>[1744] Yet another means of suppressing gene expression is to insert a polynucleotide into the
   gene of interest to disrupt transcription or translation of the gene. </p>
  <p>[1745] Homologous recombination could be used to target a polynucleotide insert to a gene using
   the Cre-Lox system (<ref type="npl">A.C. Vergunst et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 26:2729 (1998)</ref>, <ref type="npl">A.C. Vergunst et
   al., Plant Mol. Biol. 38:393 (1998)</ref>, <ref type="npl">H. Albert et al., Plant J. 7:649 (1995))</ref>. </p>
  <p>[1746] In addition, random insertion of polynucleotides into a host cell genome can also be
   used to disrupt the gene of interest. <ref type="npl">Azpiroz-Leehan et al., Trends in Genetics 13:152 (1997)</ref>. In
   this method, screening for clones from a library containing random insertions is preferred for
   identifying those that have polynucleotides inserted into the gene of interest. Such screening
   can be performed using probes and/or primers described above based on sequences from TABLE 1,
   fragments thereof, and substantially similar sequence thereto. The screening can also be
   performed by selecting clones or any transgenic plants having a desired phenotype. </p>
  <p> III.A.5. Regulatory SequenceModulation </p>
  <p>[1747] The SDFs described in Table 1, and fragments thereof are examples of nucleotides of the
   invention that contain regulatory sequences that can be used to suppress or inactivate
   transcription and/or translation from a gene of interest as discussed in I.C.5. </p>
  <p> III.A.6. Genes Comprising Dominant-Negative Mutations </p>
  <p>[1748] When suppression of production of the endogenous, native protein is desired it is often
   helpful to express a gene comprising a dominant negative mutation. Production of protein variants
   produced from genes comprising dominant negative mutations is a useful tool for research Genes
   comprising dominant negative mutations can produce a variant polypeptide which is capable of
   competing with the native polypeptide, but which does not produce the native result.
   Consequently, over expression of genes comprising these mutations can titrate out an undesired
   activity of the native protein. For example, The product from a gene comprising a dominant
   negative mutation of a receptor can be used to constitutively activate or suppress a signal
   transduction cascade, allowing examination of the phenotype and thus the trait(s) controlled by
   that receptor and pathway. Alternatively, the protein arising from the gene comprising a
   dominant-negative mutation can be an inactive enzyme still capable of binding to the same
   substrate as the native protein and therefore competes with such native protein. </p>
  <p>[1749] Products from genes comprising dominant-negative mutations can also act upon the native
   protein itself to prevent activity. For example, the native protein may be active only as a
   homo-multimer or as one subunit of a hetero-multimer. Incorporation of an inactive subunit into
   the multimer with native subunit(s) can inhibit activity. </p>
  <p>[1750] Thus, gene function can be modulated in host cells of interest by insertion into these
   cells vector constructs comprising a gene comprising a dominant-negative mutation. </p>
  <p> III.B. Enhanced Expression </p>
  <p>[1751] Enhanced expression of a gene of interest in a host cell can be accomplished by either
   (1) insertion of an exogenous gene; or (2) promoter modulation. </p>
  <p> III.B.1. Insertion of an Exogenous Gene </p>
  <p>[1752] Insertion of an expression construct encoding an exogenous gene can boost the number of
   gene copies expressed in a host cell. </p>
  <p>[1753] Such expression constructs can comprise genes that either encode the native protein that
   is of interest or that encode a variant that exhibits enhanced activity as compared to the native
   protein. Such genes encoding proteins of interest can be constructed from the sequences from
   TABLE 1, fragments thereof, and substantially similar sequence thereto. </p>
  <p>[1754] Such an exogenous gene can include either a constitutive promoter permitting expression
   in any cell in a host organism or a promoter that directs transcription only in particular cells
   or times during a host cell life cycle or in response to environmental stimuli. </p>
  <p> III.B.2. Regulatory Sequence Modulation </p>
  <p>[1755] The SDFs of Table 1, and fragments thereof, contain regulatory sequences that can be
   used to enhance expression of a gene of interest. For example, some of these sequences contain
   useful enhancer elements. In some cases, duplication of enhancer elements or insertion of
   exogenous enhancer elements will increase expression of a desired gene from a particular
   promoter. As other examples, all 11 promoters require binding of a regulatory protein to be
   activated, while some promoters may need a protein that signals a promoter binding protein to
   expose a polymerase binding site. In either case, over-production of such proteins can be used to
   enhance expression of a gene of interest by increasing the activation time of the promoter. </p>
  <p>[1756] Such regulatory proteins are encoded by some of the sequences in TABLE 1, fragments
   thereof, and substantially similar sequences thereto. </p>
  <p>[1757] Coding sequences for these proteins can be constructed as described above. </p>
  <p> IV. Gene Constructs and Vector Construction </p>
  <p>[1758] To use isolated SDFs of the present invention or a combination of them or parts and/or
   mutants and/or fusions of said SDFs in the above techniques, recombinant DNA vectors which
   comprise said SDFs and are suitable for transformation of cells, such as plant cells, are usually
   prepared. The SDF construct can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques (Sambrook et
   al. 1989) and can be introduced to the species of interest by Agrobacterium-mediated
   transformation or by other means of transformation (e.g., particle gun bombardment) as referenced
   below. </p>
  <p>[1759] The vector backbone can be any of those typical in the art such as plasmids, viruses,
   artificial chromosomes, BACs, YACs and PACs and vectors of the sort described by (a) BAC: <ref type="npl">Shizuya
   et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 8794-8797 (1992)</ref>; <ref type="npl">Hamilton et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
   USA 93: 9975-9979 (1996)</ref>; (b) YAC: <ref type="npl">Burke et al., Science 236:806-812 (1987)</ref>;. (c) PAC: <ref type="npl">Sternberg
   N. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. Jan;87(1):103-7 (1990)</ref>; (d) Bacteria-Yeast Shuttle Vectors:
   <ref type="npl">Bradshaw et al., Nucl Acids Res 23: 4850-4856 (1995)</ref>; (e) Lambda Phage Vectors: Replacement
   Vector, e.g., <ref type="npl">Frischauf et al., J. Mol Biol 170: 827-842 (1983)</ref>; or Insertion vector, e.g., <ref type="book">Huynh
   et al., In: Glover NM (ed) DNA Cloning: A practical Approach, Vol.1 Oxford: IRL Press (1985)</ref>; (f)
   T-DNA gene fusion vectors :<ref type="npl">Walden et al., Mol Cell Biol 1: 175-194 (1990)</ref>; and (g) Plasmid
   vectors: Sambrook et al., infra. </p>
  <p>[1760] Typically, a vector will comprise the exogenous gene, which in its turn comprises an SDF
   of the present invention to be introduced into the genome of a host cell, and which gene may be
   an antisense construct, a ribozyme construct chimeraplast, or a coding sequence with any desired
   transcriptional and/or translational regulatory sequences, such as promoters, UTRs, and 3' end
   termination sequences. Vectors of the invention can also include origins of replication, scaffold
   attachment regions (SARs), markers, homologous sequences, introns, etc. </p>
  <p>[1761] A DNA sequence coding for the desired polypeptide, for example a cDNA sequence encoding
   a full length protein, will preferably be combined with transcriptional and translational
   initiation regulatory sequences which will direct the transcription of the sequence from the gene
   in the intended tissues of the transformed plant. </p>
  <p>[1762] For example, for over-expression, a plant promoter fragment may be employed that will
   direct transcription of the gene in all tissues of a regenerated plant. Alternatively, the plant
   promoter may direct transcription of an SDF of the invention in a specific tissue
   (tissue-specific promoters) or may be otherwise under more precise environmental control
   (inducible promoters). </p>
  <p>*[1763] If proper polypeptide productionis desired, a polyadenylation region at the 3'-end of
   the coding region is typically included. The polyadenylation region can be derived from the
   natural gene, from a variety of other plant genes, or from T-DNA. </p>
  <p>[1764] The vector comprising the sequences from genes or SDF or the invention may comprise a
   marker gene that confers a selectable phenotype on plant cells. The vector can include promoter
   and coding sequence, for instance. For example, the marker may encode biocide resistance,
   particularly antibiotic resistance, such as resistance to kanamycin, G418, bleomycin, hygromycin,
   or herbicide resistance, such as resistance to chlorosulfuron or phosphinotricin. </p>
  <p> IV.A. Coding Sequences </p>
  <p>[1765] Generally, the sequence in the transformation vector and to be introduced into the
   genome of the host cell does not need to be absolutely identical to an SDF of the present
   invention. Also, it is not necessary for it to be full length, relative to either the primary
   transcription product or fully processed mRNA. Furthermore, the introduced sequence need not have
   the same intron or exon pattern as a native gene. Also, heterologous non-coding segments can be
   incorporated into the coding sequence without changing the desired amino acid sequence of the
   polypeptide to be produced </p>
  <p> IV.B. Promoters </p>
  <p>[1766] As explained above, introducing an exogenous SDF from the same species or an orthologous
   SDF from another species can modulate the expression of a native gene corresponding to that SDF
   of interest. Such an SDF construct can be under the control of either a constitutive promoter or
   a highly regulated inducible promoter (e.g., a copper inducible promoter). The promoter of
   interest can initially be either endogenous or heterologous to the species in question. When
   re-introduced into the genome of said species, such promoter becomes exogenous to said species.
   Over-expression of an SDF transgene can lead to co-suppression of the homologous endogeneous
   sequence thereby creating some alterations in the phenotypes of the transformed species as
   demonstrated by similar analysis of the chalcone synthase gene (<ref type="npl">Napoli et al., Plant Cell 2:279
   (1990)</ref> and <ref type="npl">van der Krol et al., Plant Cell 2:291 (1990)</ref>). If an SDF is found to encode a protein
   with desirable characteristics, its over-production can be controlled so that its accumulation
   can be manipulated in an organ- or tissue-specific manner utilizing a promoter having such
   specificity. </p>
  <p> [1767] Likewise, if the promoter of an SDF (or an SDF that includes a promoter) is found to be
   tissue-specific or developmentally regulated, such a promoter can be utilized to drive or
   facilitate the transcription of a specific gene of interest (e.g., seed storage protein or
   root-specific protein). Thus, the level of accumulation of a particular protein can be
   manipulated or its spatial localization in an organ- or tissue- specific manner can be altered. </p>
  <p> IV. C Signal Peptides </p>
  <p>[1768] SDFs of the present invention containing signal peptides are indicated in Table 1. In
   some cases it may be desirable for the protein encoded by an introduced exogenous or orthologous
   SDF to be targeted (1) to a particular organelle intracellular compartment, (2) to interact with
   a particular molecule such as a membrane molecule or (3) for secretion outside of the cell
   harboring the introduced SDF. This will be accomplished using a signal peptide. </p>
  <p>[1769] Signal peptides direct protein targeting, are involved in ligand-receptor interactions
   and act in cell to cell communication. Many proteins, especially soluble proteins, contain a
   signal peptide that targets the protein to one of several different intracellular compartments.
   In plants, these compartments include, but are not limited to, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
   mitochondria, plastids (such as chloroplasts), the vacuole, the Golgi apparatus, protein storage
   vessicles (PSV) and, in general, membranes. Some signal peptide sequences are conserved, such as
   the Asn-Pro-Ile-Arg amino acid motif found in the N-terminal propeptide signal that targets
   proteins to the vacuole (<ref type="npl">Marty (1999) The Plant Cell 11: 587-599</ref>). Other signal peptides do not
   have a consensus sequence per se, but are largely composed of hydrophobic amino acids, such as
   those signal peptides targeting proteins to the ER (<ref type="npl">Vitale and Denecke (1999) The Plant Cell 11:
   615-628</ref>). Still others do not appear to contain either a consensus sequence or an identified
   common secondary sequence, for instance the chloroplast stromal targeting signal peptides
   (<ref type="npl">Keegstra and Cline (1999) The Plant Cell 11: 557-570</ref>). Furthermore, some targeting peptides are
   bipartite, directing proteins first to an organelle and then to a membrane within the organelle
   (e.g. within the thylakoid lumen of the chloroplast; see <ref type="npl">Keegstra and Cline (1999) The Plant Cell
   11: 557-570</ref>). In addition to the diversity in sequence and secondary structure, placement of the
   signal peptide is also varied. Proteins destined for the vacuole, for example, have targeting
   signal peptides found at the N-terminus, at the C-terminus and at a surface location in mature,
   folded proteins. Signal peptides also serve as ligands for some receptors. </p>
  <p>[1770] These characteristics of signal proteins can be used to more tightly control the
   phenotypic expression of introduced SDFs. In particular, associating the appropriate signal
   sequence with a specific SDF can allow sequestering of the protein in specific organelles
   (plastids, as an example), secretion outside of the cell, targeting interaction with particular
   receptors, etc. Hence, the inclusion of signal proteins in constructs involving the SDFs of the
   invention increases the range of manipulation of SDF phenotypic expression. The nucleotide
   sequence of the signal peptide can be isolated from characterized genes using common molecular
   biological techniques or can be synthesized in vitro. </p>
  <p>[1771] In addition, the native signal peptide sequences, both amino acid and nucleotide,
   described in Table 1 can be used to modulate polypeptide transport. Further variants of the
   native signal peptides described in Table 1 are contemplated. Insertions, deletions, or
   substitutions can be made. Such variants will retain at least one of the functions of the native
   signal peptide as well as exhibiting some degree of sequence identity to the native sequence. </p>
  <p>[1772] Also, fragments of the signal peptides of the invention are useful and can be fused with
   other signal peptides of interest to modulate transport of a polypeptide. </p>
  <p> V. Transformation Techniques </p>
  <p>[1773] A wide range of techniques for inserting exogenous polynucleotides are known for a
   number of host cells, including, without limitation, bacterial, yeast, mammalian, insect and
   plant cells. </p>
  <p>[1774] Techniques for transforming a wide variety of higher plant species are well known and
   described in the technical and scientific literature. See, e.g. <ref type="npl">Weising et al., Ann. Rev. Genet.
   22:421 (1988)</ref>; and <ref type="npl">Christou, Euphytica, v. 85, n.1-3:13-27, (1995)</ref>. </p>
  <p>[1775] DNA constructs of the invention may be introduced into the genome of the desired plant
   host by a variety of conventional techniques. For example, the DNA construct may be introduced
   directly into the genomic DNA of the plant cell using techniques such as electroporation and
   microinjection of plant cell protoplasts, or the DNA constructs can be introduced directly to
   plant tissue using ballistic methods, such as DNA particle bombardment. Alternatively, the DNA
   constructs may be combined with suitable T-DNA flanking regions and introduced into a
   conventional Agrobacterium tumefaciens host vector. The virulence functions of the Agrobacterium
   tumefaciens host will direct the insertion of the construct and adjacent marker into the plant
   cell DNA when the cell is infected by the bacteria (<ref type="npl">McCormac et al., Mol. Biotechnol. 8:199
   (1997)</ref>; <ref type="npl">Hamilton, Gene 200:107 (1997)</ref>); <ref type="npl">Salomon et al. EMBO J. 3:141 (1984)</ref>; <ref type="npl">Herrera-Estrella et
   al. EMBO J. 2:987 (1983)</ref>. </p>
  <p>[1776] Microinjection techniques are known in the art and well described in the scientific and
   patent literature. The introduction of DNA constructs using polyethylene glycol precipitation is
   described in <ref type="npl">Paszkowski et al. EMBO J. 3:2717 (1984)</ref>. Electroporation techniques are described in
   <ref type="npl">Fromm et al. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 82:5824 (1985)</ref>. Ballistic transformation techniques are
   described in <ref type="npl">Klein et al. Nature 327:773 (1987)</ref>. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
   transformation techniques, including disarming and use of binary or cointegrate vectors, are well
   described in the scientific literature. See, for example <ref type="npl">Hamilton, CM, Gene 200:107 (1997)</ref>;
   <ref type="npl">Müller et al. Mol. Gen. Genet. 207:171 (1987)</ref>; <ref type="npl">Komari et al. Plant J. 10:165 (1996)</ref>;
   <ref type="npl">Venkateswarlu et al. Biotechnology 9:1103 (1991)</ref> and <ref type="npl">Gleave, AP., Plant Mol. Biol. 20:1203
   (1992)</ref>; <ref type="npl">Graves and Goldman, Plant Mol. Biol. 7:34 (1986</ref>) and <ref type="npl">Gould et al., Plant Physiology
   95:426 (1991)</ref>. </p>
  <p>[1777] Transformed plant cells which are derived by any of the above transformation techniques
   can be cultured to regenerate a whole plant that possesses the transformed genotype and thus the
   desired phenotype such as seedlessness. Such regeneration techniques rely on manipulation of
   certain phytohormones in a tissue culture growth medium, typically relying on a biocide and/or
   herbicide marker which has been introduced together with the desired nucleotide sequences. Plant
   regeneration from cultured protoplasts is described in <ref type="book">Evans et al., Protoplasts Isolation and
   Culture in &quot;Handbook of Plant Cell Culture,&quot; pp. 124-176, MacMillan Publishing Company,
   New York, 1983</ref>; and <ref type="book">Binding, Regeneration of Plants, Plant Protoplasts, pp. 21-73, CRC Press,
   Boca Raton, 1988</ref>. Regeneration can also be obtained from plant callus, explants, organs, or parts
   thereof. Such regeneration techniques are described generally in <ref type="npl">Klee et al. Ann. Rev. of Plant
   Phys. 38:467 (1987)</ref>. Regeneration of monocots (rice) is described by <ref type="npl">Hosoyama et al. (Biosci.
    Biotechnol. Biochem. 58:1500 (1994))</ref> and by <ref type="npl">Ghosh et al. (J. Biotechnol. 32:1 (1994))</ref>. The
   nucleic acids of the invention can be used to confer desired traits on essentially any plant. </p>
  <p>[1778] Thus, the invention has use over a broad range of plants, including species from the
   genera Anacardium, Arachis, Asparagus, Atropa, Avena, Brassica, Citrus, Citrullus, Capsicum,
   Carthamus, Cocos, Coffea, Cucumis, Cucurbita, Daucus, Elaeis, Fragaria, Glycine, Gossypium,

  <p>[1779] One of skill will recognize that after the expression cassette is stably incorporated in
   transgenic plants and confirmed to be operable, it can be introduced into other plants by sexual
   crossing. Any of a number of standard breeding techniques can be used, depending upon the species
   to be crossed. </p>
  <p>[1780] The particular sequences of SDFs identified are provided in the attached TABLE 1. One of
   ordinary skill in the art, having this data, can obtain cloned DNA fragments, synthetic DNA
   fragments or polypeptides constituting desired sequences by recombinant methodology known in the
   art or described herein. </p>
  <p> EXAMPLES </p>
  <p>[1781] The invention is illustrated by way of the following examples. The invention is not
   limited by these examples as the scope of the invention is defined solely by the claims
   following. </p>
  <p> EXAMPLE 1: cDNA PREPARATION </p>
  <p>[1782] A number of the nucleotide sequences disclosed in TABLE 1 herein as representative of
   the SDFs of the invention can be obtained by sequencing genomic DNA (gDNA) and/or cDNA from corn
   plants grown from HYBRID SEED # 35A19, purchased from Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., Supply
   Management, P.O. Box 256, Johnston, Iowa 50131-0256. </p>
  <p>[1783] A number of the nucleotide sequences disclosed in TABLE 1 herein as representative of
   the SDFs of the invention can also be obtained by sequencing genomic DNA from Arabidopsis
   thaliana, Wassilewskija ecotype or by sequencing cDNA obtained from mRNA from such plants as
   described below. This is a true breeding strain. Seeds of the plant are available from the
   Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at the Ohio State University, under the accession number
   CS2360. Seeds of this plant were deposited under the terms and conditions of the Budapest Treaty
   at the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA on August 31, 1999, and were assigned ATCC
   No. PTA-595. </p>
  <p>[1784] Other methods for cloning full-length cDNA are described, for example, by <ref type="npl">Seki et al.,
   Plant Journal 15:707-720 (1998)</ref> &quot;High-efficiency cloning of Arabidopsis full-length cDNA by
   biotinylated Cap trapper&quot;; <ref type="npl">Maruyama et al., Gene 138:171 (1994)</ref> &quot;Oligo-capping a simple
   method to replace the cap structure of eukaryotic mRNAs with oligoribonucleotides&quot;; and <ref
    type="pl">WO 96/34981</ref>. </p>
  <p>[1785] Tissues were, or each organ was, individually pulverized and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
   Next, the samples were homogenized in the presence of detergents and then centrifuged. The debris
   and nuclei were removed from the sample and more detergents were added to the sample. The sample
   was centrifuged and the debris was removed. Then the sample was applied to a 2M sucrose cushion
   to isolate polysomes. The RNA was isolated by treatment with detergents and proteinase K followed
   by ethanol precipitation and centrifugation. The polysomal RNA from the different tissues was
   pooled according to the following mass ratios: 15/15/1 for male inflorescences, female
   inflorescences and root, respectively. The pooled material was then used for cDNA synthesis by
   the methods described below. </p>
  <p>[1786] Starting material for cDNA synthesis for the exemplary corn cDNA clones with sequences
   presented in TABLE 1 was poly(A)-containing polysomal mRNAs from inflorescences and root tissues
   of corn plants grown from HYBRID SEED # 35A19. Male inflorescences and female (pre-and
   post-fertilization) inflorescences were isolated at various stages of development. Selection for
   poly(A) containing polysomal RNA was done using oligo d(T) cellulose columns, as described by <ref type="book">Cox
   and Goldberg, &quot;Plant Molecular Biology: A Practical Approach&quot;, pp. 1-35, Shaw ed., c.
   1988 by IRL, Oxford</ref>. The quality and the integrity of the polyA+ RNAs were evaluated. </p>
  <p>[1787] Starting material for cDNA synthesis for the exemplary Arabidopsis cDNA clones with
   sequences presented in TABLE 1 was polysomal RNA isolated from the topmost inflorescence tissues
   of Arabidopsis thaliana Wassilewskija (Ws.) and from roots of Arabidopsis thaliana Landsberg
   erecta (L. er.), also obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Nine parts
   inflorescence to every part root was used, as measured by wet mass. Tissue was pulverized and
   exposed to liquid nitrogen. Next, the sample was homogenized in the presence of detergents and
   then centrifuged. The debris and nuclei were removed from the sample and more detergents were
   added to the sample. The sample was centrifuged and the debris was removed and the sample was
   applied to a 2M sucrose cushion to isolate polysomal RNA. <ref type="book">Cox et al., &quot;Plant Molecular
   Biology: A Practical Approach&quot;, pp. 1-35, Shaw ed., c. 1988 by IRL, Oxford</ref>. The polysomal
   RNA was used for cDNA synthesis by the methods described below. Polysomal mRNA was then isolated
   as described above for corn cDNA. The quality of the RNA was assessed electrophoretically. </p>
  <p>[1788] Following preparation of the mRNAs from various tissues as described above, selection of
   mRNA with intact 5' ends and specific attachment of an oligonucleotide tag to the 5' end of such
   mRNA was performed using either a chemical or enzymatic approach. Both techniques take advantage
   of the presence of the &quot;cap&quot; structure, which characterizes the 5' end of most intact
   mRNAs and which comprises a guanosine generally methylated once, at the 7 position. </p>
  <p>[1789] The chemical modification approach involves the optional elimination of the 2', 3'-cis
   diol of the 3' terminal ribose, the oxidation of the 2', 3'-cis diol of the ribose linked to the
   cap of the 5' ends of the mRNAs into a dialdehyde, and the coupling of the such obtained
   dialdehyde to a derivatized oligonucleotide tag. Further detail regarding the chemical approaches
   for obtaining mRNAs having intact 5' ends are disclosed in International Application No. <ref
    type="pl">WO96/34981</ref> published November 7, 1996. </p>
  <p>[1790] The enzymatic approach for ligating the oligonucleotide tag to the intact 5' ends of
   mRNAs involves the removal of the phosphate groups present on the 5' ends of uncapped incomplete
   mRNAs, the subsequent decapping of mRNAs having intact 5' ends and the ligation of the phosphate
   present at the 5' end of the decapped mRNA to an oligonucleotide tag. Further detail regarding
   the enzymatic approaches for obtaining mRNAs having intact 5' ends are disclosed in Dumas Milne
   Edwards J.B. (Doctoral Thesis of Paris VI University, Le clonage des ADNc complets: difficultés
   et perspectives nouvelles. Apports pour l'étude de la régulation de l'expression de la
   tryptophane hydroxylase de rat, 20 Dec. 1993), <ref type="pl">EP0 625572</ref> and <ref type="npl">Kato et al., Gene 150:243-250
   (1994)</ref>. </p>
  <p>[1791] In both the chemical and the enzymatic approach, the oligonucleotide tag has a
   restriction enzyme site (e.g. an EcoRI site) therein to facilitate later cloning procedures.
   Following attachment of the oligonucleotide tag to the mRNA, the integrity of the mRNA is
   examined by performing a Northern blot using a probe complementary to the oligonucleotide tag. </p>
  <p>[1792] For the mRNAs joined to oligonucleotide tags using either the chemical or the enzymatic
   method, first strand cDNA synthesis is performed using an oligo-dT primer with reverse
   transcriptase. This oligo-dT primer can contain an internal tag of at least 4 nucleotides, which
   can be different from one mRNA preparation to another. Methylated dCTP is used for cDNA first
   strand synthesis to protect the internal EcoRI sites from digestion during subsequent steps. The
   first strand cDNA is precipitated using isopropanol after removal of RNA by alkaline hydrolysis
   to eliminate residual primers. </p>
  <p>[1793] Second strand cDNA synthesis is conducted using a DNA polymerase, such as Klenow
   fragment and a primer corresponding to the 5' end of the ligated oligonucleotide. The primer is
   typically 20-25 bases in length. Methylated dCTP is used for second strand synthesis in order to
   protect internal EcoRI sites in the cDNA from digestion during the cloning process. </p>
  <p>[1794] Following second strand synthesis, the full-length cDNAs are cloned into a phagemid
   vector, such as pBlueScript TM (Stratagene). The ends of the full-length cDNAs are blunted with
   T4 DNA polymerase (Biolabs) and the cDNA is digested with EcoRI. Since methylated dCTP is used
   during cDNA synthesis, the EcoRI site present in the tag is the only hemi-methylated site; hence
   the only site susceptible to EcoRI digestion. In some instances, to facilitate subcloning, an
   Hind III adapter is added to the 3' end of full-length cDNAs. </p>
  <p>[1795] The full-length cDNAs are then size fractionated using either exclusion chromatography
   (AcA, Biosepra) or electrophoretic separation which yields 3 to 6 different fractions. The
   full-length cDNAs are then directionally cloned either into pBlueScript TM using either the EcoRI
   and SmaI restriction sites or, when the Hind III adapter is present in the full-length cDNAs, the
   EcoRI and Hind III restriction sites. The ligation mixture is transformed, preferably by
   electroporation, into bacteria, which are then propagated under appropriate antibiotic selection. </p>
  <p>[1796] Clones containing the oligonucleotide tag attached to full-length cDNAs are selected as
   follows. </p>
  <p>[1797] The plasmid cDNA libraries made as described above are purified (e.g. by a column
   available from Qiagen). A positive selection of the tagged clones is performed as follows.
   Briefly, in this selection procedure, the plasmid DNA is converted to single stranded DNA using
   phage F1 gene II endonuclease in combination with an exonuclease (<ref type="npl">Chang et al., Gene 127:95
   (1993)</ref>) such as exonuclease III or T7 gene 6 exonuclease. The resulting single stranded DNA is
   then purified using paramagnetic beads as described by <ref type="npl">Fry et al., Biotechniques 13: 124 (1992)</ref>.
   Here the single stranded DNA is hybridized with a biotinylated oligonucleotide having a sequence
   corresponding to the 3' end of the oligonucleotide tag. Preferably, the primer has a length of
   20-25 bases. Clones including a sequence complementary to the biotinylated oligonucleotide are
   selected by incubation with streptavidin coated magnetic beads followed by magnetic capture.
   After capture of the positive clones, the plasmid DNA is released from the magnetic beads and
   converted into double stranded DNA using a DNA polymerase such as ThermoSequenase TM (obtained
   from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Alternatively, protocols such as the Gene Trapper TM kit (Gibco
   BRL) can be used. The double stranded DNA is then transformed, preferably by electroporation,
   into bacteria. The percentage of positive clones having the 5' tag oligonucleotide is typically
   estimated to be between 90 and 98% from dot blot analysis. </p>
  <p>[1798] Following transformation, the libraries are ordered in microtiter plates and sequenced.
   The Arabidopsis library was deposited at the American Type Culture Collection on January 7, 2000
   as &quot;E-coli liba 010600&quot; under the accession number PTA-1161. </p>
  <p> EXAMPLE 2: SOUTHERN HYBRIDIZATIONS </p>
  <p>[1799] The SDFs of the invention can be used in Southern hybridizations as described above. The
   following describes extraction of DNA from nuclei of plant cells, digestion of the nuclear DNA
   and separation by length, transfer of the separated fragments to membranes, preparation of probes
   for hybridization, hybridization and detection of the hybridized probe. </p>
  <p>[1800] The procedures described herein can be used to isolate related polynucleotides or for
   diagnostic purposes. Moderate stringency hybridization conditions, as defined above, are
   described in the present example. These conditions result in detection of hybridization between
   sequences having at least 70% sequence identity. As described above, the hybridization and wash
   conditions can be changed to reflect the desired percenatge of sequence identity between probe
   and target sequences that can be detected. </p>
  <p>[1801] In the following procedure, a probe for hybridization is produced from two PCR reactions
   using two primers from genomic sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana. As described above, the
   particular template for generating the probe can be any desired template. </p>
  <p>[1802] The first PCR product is assessed to validate the size of the primer to assure it is of
   the expected size. Then the product of the first PCR is used as a template, with the same pair of
   primers used in the first PCR, in a second PCR that produces a labeled product used as the probe. </p>
  <p>[1803] Fragments detected by hybridization, or other bands of interest, can be isolated from
   gels used to separate genomic DNA fragments by known methods for further purification and/or
   characterization. </p>

   (add 0.0875 g to 5 ml 100% ethanol) &lt;tb&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt; 2. Homogenize the tissue in a
   blender (use 300-400 ml of 1xHB per blender). Be sure that you use 5-10 ml of HB buffer per gram
   of tissue. Blenders generate heat so be sure to keep the homogenate cold. It is necessary to put
   the blenders in ice periodically. 3. Add the 20% Triton X-100 (25 ml per liter of homogenate) and
   gently stir on ice for 20 min. This lyses plastid, but not nuclear, membranes. 4. Filter the
   tissue suspension through several nylon filters into an ice-cold beaker. The first filtration is
   through a 250-micron membrane; the second is through an 85-micron membrane; the third is through
   a 50-micron membrane; and the fourth is through a 20-micron membrane. Use a large funnel to hold
   the filters. Filtration can be sped up by gently squeezing the liquid through the filters. 5.
   Centrifuge the filtrate at 1200 x g for 20 min. at 4 DEG C to pellet the nuclei. 6. Discard the
   dark green supernatant. The pellet will have several layers to it. One is starch; it is white and
   gritty. The nuclei are gray and soft. In the early steps, there may be a dark green and somewhat
   viscous layer of chloroplasts. Wash the pellets in about 25 ml cold H buffer (with Triton X-100)
   and resuspend by swirling gently and pipetting. After the pellets are resuspended. Pellet the
   nuclei again at 1200 - 1300 x g. Discard the supernatant. Repeat the wash 3-4 times until the
   supernatant has changed from a dark green to a pale green. This usually happens after 3 or 4
   resuspensions. At this point, the pellet is typically grayish white and very slippery. The Triton
   X-100 in these repeated steps helps to destroy the chloroplasts and mitochondria that contaminate
   the prep. Resuspend the nuclei for a final time in a total of 15 ml of H buffer and transfer the
   suspension to a sterile 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask. 7. Add 15 ml, dropwise, cold 2% Sarkosyl, 0.1 M
   Tris, 0.04 M EDTA solution (pH 9.5) while swirling gently. This lyses the nuclei. The solution
   will become very viscous. 8. Add 30 grams of CsCl and gently swirl at room temperature until the
   CsCl is in solution. The mixture will be gray, white and viscous. 9. Centrifuge the solution at
   11,400 x g at 4 DEG C for at least 30 min. The longer this spin is, the firmer the protein
   pellicle. 10. The result is typically a clear green supernatant over a white pellet, and
   (perhaps) under a protein pellicle. Carefully remove the solution under the protein pellicle and
   above the pellet. Determine the density of the solution by weighing 1 ml of solution and add CsCl
   if necessary to bring to 1.57 g/ml. The solution contains dissolved solids (sucrose etc) and the
   refractive index alone will not be an accurate guide to CsCl concentration. 11. Add 20 mu l of 10
   mg/ml EtBr per ml of solution. 12. Centrifuge at 184,000 x g for 16 to 20 hours in a fixed-angle
   rotor. 13. Remove the dark red supernatant that is at the top of the tube with a plastic transfer
   pipette and discard. Carefully remove the DNA band with another transfer pipette. The DNA band is
   usually visible in room light; otherwise, use a long wave UV light to locate the band. 14.
   Extract the ethidium bromide with isopropanol saturated with water and salt. Once the solution is
   clear, extract at least two more times to ensure that all of the EtBr is gone. Be very gentle, as
   it is very easy to shear the DNA at this step. This extraction may take a while because the DNA
   solution tends to be very viscous. If the solution is too viscous, dilute it with TE. 15. Dialyze
   the DNA for at least two days against several changes (at least three times) of TE (10 mM Tris,
   1mM EDTA, pH 8) to remove the cesium chloride. 16. Remove the dialyzed DNA from the tubing. If
   the dialyzed DNA solution contains a lot of debris, centrifuge the DNA solution at least at 2500
   x g for 10 min. and carefully transfer the clear supernatant to a new tube. Read the A260
   concentration of the DNA. 17. Assess the quality of the DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis (1%
   agarose gel) of the DNA. Load 50 ng and 100 ng (based on the OD reading) and compare it with
   known and good quality DNA. Undigested lambda DNA and a lambda-HindIII-digested DNA are good
   molecular weight makers. </p>
  <p> Protocol for Digestion of Genomic DNA </p>
  <p> Protocol: </p>
  <p> 1. The relative amounts of DNA for different crop plants that provide approximately a balanced
   number of genome equivalent is given in Table 3. Note that due to the size of the wheat genome,
   wheat DNA will be underrepresented. Lambda DNA provides a useful control for complete digestion.
   2. Precipitate the DNA by adding 3 volumes of 100% ethanol. Incubate at -20 DEG C for at least
   two hours. Yeast DNA can be purchased and made up at the necessary concentration, therefore no
   precipitation is necessary for yeast DNA. 3. Centrifuge the solution at 11,400 x g for 20 min.
   Decant the ethanol carefully (be careful not to disturb the pellet). Be sure that the residual
   ethanol is completely removed either by vacuum desiccation or by carefully wiping the sides of
   the tubes with a clean tissue. 4. Resuspend the pellet in an appropriate volume of water. Be sure
   the pellet is fully resuspended before proceeding to the next step. This may take about 30 min.
   5. Add the appropriate volume of 10X reaction buffer provided by the manufacturer of the
   restriction enzyme to the resuspended DNA followed by the appropriate volume of enzymes. Be sure
   to mix it properly by slowly swirling the tubes. 6. Set-up the lambda digestion-control for each
   DNA that you are digesting. 7. Incubate both the experimental and lambda digests overnight at 37
   DEG C. Spin down condensation in a microfuge before proceeding. 8. After digestion, add 2 mu l of
   loading dye (typically 0.25% bromophenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol in 15% Ficoll or 30% glycerol)
   to the lambda-control digests and load in 1% TPE-agarose gel (TPE is 90 mM Tris-phosphate, 2 mM
   EDTA, pH 8). If the lambda DNA in the lambda control digests are completely digested, proceed
   with the precipitation of the genomic DNA in the digests. 9. Precipitate the digested DNA by
   adding 3 volumes of 100% ethanol and incubating in -20 DEG C for at least 2 hours (preferably
   overnight). EXCEPTION: Arabidopsis and yeast DNA are digested in an appropriate volume; they
   don't have to be precipitated. 10. Resuspend the DNA in an appropriate volume of TE (e.g., 22 mu
   l x 50 blots = 1100 mu l) and an appropriate volume of 10X loading dye (e.g., 2.4 mu l x 50 blots
   = 120 mu l). Be careful in pipetting the loading dye - it is viscous. Be sure you are pipetting
   the correct volume. &lt;tb&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt; Id=Table 3 Columns=5 &lt;tb&gt;Title: Some guide

  <p> Protocol for Southern Blot Analysis </p>
  <p>[1807] The digested DNA samples are electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels in 1x TPE buffer. Low
   voltage; overnight separations are preferred. The gels are stained with EtBr and photographed. 1.
   For blotting the gels, first incubate the gel in 0.25 N HCl (with gentle shaking) for about 15
   min. 2. Then briefly rinse with water. The DNA is denatured by 2 incubations. Incubate (with
   shaking) in 0.5 M NaOH in 1.5 M NaCl for 15 min. 3. The gel is then briefly rinsed in water and
   neutralized by incubating twice (with shaking) in 1.5 M Tris pH 7.5 in 1.5 M NaCI for 15 min. 4.
   A nylon membrane is prepared by soaking it in water for at least 5 min, then in 6X SSC for at
   least 15 min. before use. (20x SSC is 175.3 g NaCI, 88.2 g sodium citrate per liter, adjusted to
   pH 7.0.) 5. The nylon membrane is placed on top of the gel and all bubbles in between are
   removed. The DNA is blotted from the gel to the membrane using an absorbent medium, such as paper
   toweling and 6x SCC buffer. After the transfer, the membrane may be lightly brushed with a gloved
   hand to remove any agarose sticking to the surface. 6. The DNA is then fixed to the membrane by
   UV crosslinking and baking at 80 DEG C. The membrane is stored at 4 DEG C until use. </p>

   DEG C. </p>
  <p>[1809] The procedure can be adapted to a multi-well format if necessary. </p>
  <p> Quantification and Dilution of PCR Products: </p>
  <p> 1. The product of the PCR is analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. A linearized
   plasmid DNA can be used as a quantification standard (usually at 50, 100, 200, and 400 ng). These
   will be used as references to approximate the amount of PCR products. HindIII-digested Lambda DNA
   is useful as a molecular weight marker. The gel can be run fairly quickly; e.g., at 100 volts.
   The standard gel is examined to determine that the size of the PCR products is consistent with
   the expected size and if there are significant extra bands or smeary products in the PCR
   reactions. 2. The amounts of PCR products can be estimated on the basis of the plasmid standard.
   3. For the small number of reactions that produce extraneous bands, a small amount of DNA from
   bands with the correct size can be isolated by dipping a sterile 10- mu l tip into the band while
   viewing though a UV Transilluminator. The small amount of agarose gel (with the DNA fragment) is
   used in the labeling reaction. </p>

   dilution. b. Serial dilutions (e.g., 1:50, 1:2500, 1:10,000) of the newly labeled DNA probe are
   spotted. c. The membrane is fixed by UV crosslinking. d. The membrane is wetted with a small
   amount of maleate buffer and then incubated in 1% blocking solution for 15 min at room temp. e.
   The labeled DNA is then detected using alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-DIG antibody
   (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, cat. no. 1093274) and an NBT substrate according to the
   manufacture's instruction. f. Spot intensities of the control and experimental dilutions are then
   compared to estimate the concentration of the PCR-DIG-labeled probe. </p>

   &lt;tb&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt; </p>
  <p> General Procedures: </p>
  <p> 1. Place the blot in a heat-sealable plastic bag and add an appropriate volume of
   prehybridization solution (30 ml/100cm&lt;2&gt;) at room temperature. Seal the bag with a heat
   sealer, avoiding bubbles as much as possible. Lay down the bags in a large plastic tray (one tray
   can accommodate at least 4-5 bags). Ensure that the bags are lying flat in the tray so that the
   prehybridization solution is evenly distributed throughout the bag. Incubate the blot for at
   least 2 hours with gentle agitation using a waver shaker. 2. Denature DIG-labeled DNA probe by
   incubating for 10 min. at 98 DEG C using the PCR machine and immediately cool it to 4 DEG C. 3.
   Add probe to prehybridization solution (25 ng/ml; 30 ml = 750 ng total probe) and mix well but
   avoid foaming. Bubbles may lead to background. 4. Pour off the prehybridization solution from the
   hybridization bags and add new prehybridization and probe solution mixture to the bags containing
   the membrane. 5. Incubate with gentle agitation for at least 16 hours. 6. Proceed to medium
   stringency post-hybridization wash: Three times for 20 min. each with gentle agitation using 1X
   SSC, 1% SDS at 60 DEG C. All wash solutions must be prewarmed to 60 DEG C. Use about 100 ml of
   wash solution per membrane. To avoid background keep the membranes fully submerged to avoid
   drying in spots; agitate sufficiently to avoid having membranes stick to one another. 7. After
   the wash, proceed to immunological detection and CSPD development. </p>
  <p> E. Procedure for Immunological Detection with CSPD </p>

   &lt;tb&gt; &lt;tb&gt;Washing buffer&lt;SEP&gt;Maleic acid buffer with 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20.
   &lt;tb&gt; &lt;tb&gt;Blocking stock solution&lt;SEP&gt;10% blocking reagent in buffer 1. Dissolve
   (10X concentration): blocking reagent powder (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, cat. no.
   1096176) by constantly stirring on a 65 DEG C heating block or heat in a microwave, autoclave and
   store at 4 DEG C. &lt;tb&gt; &lt;tb&gt;Buffer 2 (1X blocking solution)&lt;SEP&gt;Dilute the stock
   solution 1:10 in Buffer 1. &lt;tb&gt; &lt;tb&gt;Detection buffer&lt;SEP&gt;0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M
   NaCl, pH 9.5 &lt;tb&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt; </p>
  <p> Procedure: </p>
  <p> 1. After the post-hybridization wash the blots are briefly rinsed (1-5 min.) in the maleate
   washing buffer with gentle shaking. 2. Then the membranes are incubated for 30 min. in Buffer 2
   with gentle shaking. 3. Anti-DIG-AP conjugate (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, cat. no.
   1093274) at 75 mU/ml (1:10,000) in Buffer 2 is used for detection. 75 ml of solution can be used
   for 3 blots. 4. The membrane is incubated for 30 min. in the antibody solution with gentle
   shaking. 5. The membrane are washed twice in washing buffer with gentle shaking. About 250 mls is
   used per wash for 3 blots. 6. The blots are equilibrated for 2-5 min in 60 ml detection buffer.
   7. Dilute CSPD (1:200) in detection buffer. (This can be prepared ahead of time and stored in the
   dark at 4 DEG C). The following steps must be done individually. Bags (one for detection and one
   for exposure) are generally cut and ready before doing the following steps. 8. The blot is
   carefully removed from the detection buffer and excess liquid removed without drying the
   membrane. The blot is immediately placed in a bag and 1.5 ml of CSPD solution is added. The CSPD
   solution can be spread over the membrane. Bubbles present at the edge and on the surface of the
   blot are typically removed by gentle rubbing. The membrane is incubated for 5 min. in CSPD
   solution. 9. Excess liquid is removed and the membrane is blotted briefly (DNA side up) on
   Whatman 3MM paper. Do not let the membrane dry completely. 10. Seal the damp membrane in a
   hybridization bag and incubate for 10 min at 37 DEG C to enhance the luminescent reaction. 11.
   Expose for 2 hours at room temperature to X-ray film. Multiple exposures can be taken.
   Luminescence continues for at least 24 hours and signal intensity increases during the first
   hours. </p>
  <p> Example 3: Transformation of Carrot Cells </p>
  <p>[1825] Transformation of plant cells can be accomplished by a number of methods, as described
   above. Similarly, a number of plant genera can be regenerated from tissue culture following
   transformation. Transformation and regeneration of carrot cells as described herein is
   illustrative. </p>
  <p>[1826] Single cell suspension cultures of carrot (Daucus carota) cells are established from
   hypocotyls of cultivar Early Nantes in B5 growth medium (O.L. <ref type="npl">Gamborg et al., Plant Physiol.
   45:372 (1970)</ref>) plus 2,4-D and 15 mM CaCl2 (B5-44 medium) by methods known in the art. The
   suspension cultures are subcultured by adding 10 ml of the suspension culture to 40 ml of B5-44
   medium in 250 ml flasks every 7 days and are maintained in a shaker at 150 rpm at 27 DEG C in the
   dark. </p>
  <p>[1827] The suspension culture cells are transformed with exogenous DNA as described by <ref type="npl">Z. Chen
   et al. Plant Mol. Bio. 36:163 (1998)</ref>. Briefly, 4-days post-subculture cells are incubated with
   cell wall digestion solution containing 0.4 M sorbitol, 2% driselase, 5mM MES (2-[N-Morpholino]
   ethanesulfonic acid) pH 5.0 for 5 hours. The digested cells are pelleted gently at 60 xg for 5
   min. and washed twice in W5 solution containing 154 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCI, 125 mM CaCl2 and 5mM
   glucose, pH 6.0. The protoplasts are suspended in MC solution containing 5 mM MES, 20 mM CaCl2,
   0.5 M mannitol, pH 5.7 and the protoplast density is adjusted to about 4 x 10&lt;6&gt;
   protoplasts per ml. </p>
  <p>[1828] 15-60 mu g of plasmid DNA is mixed with 0.9 ml of protoplasts. The resulting suspension
   is mixed with 40% polyethylene glycol (MW 8000, PEG 8000), by gentle inversion a few times at
   room temperature for 5 to 25 min. Protoplast culture medium known in the art is added into the
   PEG-DNA-protoplast mixture. Protoplasts are incubated in the culture medium for 24 hour to 5 days
   and cell extracts can be used for assay of transient expression of the introduced gene.
   Alternatively, transformed cells can be used to produce transgenic callus, which in turn can be
   used to produce transgenic plants, by methods known in the art. See, for example, <ref type="npl">Nomura and
   Komamine, Plt. Phys. 79:988-991 (1985)</ref>, Identification and Isolation of Single Cells that Produce
   Somatic Embryos in Carrot Suspension Cultures. </p>
  <p>[1829] An additional deposit, PTA-1411, of an E. coli Library, E. coli LibA021800, was made at
   the American Type Culture Collection in Manassas, Virginia, USA on February 22, 2000 to meet the
   requirements of Budapest Treaty for the international recognition of the deposit of
   microorganisms. This deposit was assigned ATCC accession no. PTA-1411. </p>
  <p>[1830] The invention being thus described, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the
   art that various modifications of the materials and methods for practicing the invention can be
   made. Such modifications are to be considered within the scope of the invention as defined by the
   following claims. </p>
