    <p n="0003" xml:id="_2ff0350035">A cadherin is a super family of the trans-membrane glycoprotein which controls the cell adhesion between generation|occurrence|production and a structure|tissue homeostasis (Gumbiner, J.Cell.Biol., 148:399-404(2000);Yagi et al., Genes Dev., 14:1169-1180(2000)).<lb>
        </lb>The intracellular domain of a cadherin is interacted with cytoplasm proteins, such as a catenin and p120, and the foundation of a coupling|bonding with a cadherin and an actin cytoskeleton is formed of it.<lb>
        </lb>A cadherin has five extracellular Ca&lt;2+&gt; binding domains and the small cytosolic domain highly preserve|saved between classic cadherins.<lb>
        </lb>P-cadherin, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin is contained in the component of a classic cadherin family.<lb>
        </lb>It is thought that cell adhesion molecules, such as a cadherin, play the serious|significant role for the cell junction of a cancer cell and a transfer cell (Furukawa et al., Microscopy Res.Technique, 38(4):343-352(1997)).<lb>
        </lb>P-cadherin expression in a normal adult tissue is low, and is restrict|limited mainly to the base layer of a myoepithelial cell and the stratified epithelium (Shimoyama et al., Cancer Res., 49:2128-33(1989)).<lb>
        </lb>P-cadherin is upregulated by inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and colitis (Hardy et al., Gut, 50:513-519(2002)).<lb>
        </lb>It is clear from a series of extensive proof now that abnormal P-cadherin expression is also related to the tumor of cell growth, the colon, a breast, a lung, a thyroid gland, and a uterine cervix (Gamallo, Modern Pathology, 14:650-654 (2001);, Stefansson et al., J.Clin.Oncol.,<lb>
        </lb>22 (7) :1242-1252 (2004)).<lb>
        </lb>It was reported that antigen recognition of the human P-cadherin is carried out by the NCC-CAD-299 monoclonal antibody produced with respect to the vulva epidermoid carcinoma (Shimoyama et al., Cancer Res., 49:2128-2133(1989)).<lb>
        </lb>When the adhesion|attachment and intracellular signal transduction which P-cadherin carries are adjusted, it will estimate|forecast that the proliferation and survival of the tumor cells in in vivo fall.</p>
    <head xml:id="_2ff0350046">PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</head>
    <p n="0004" xml:id="_2ff0350047">Therefore, when the central role considered that P-cadherin has in cell growth and advancing of a solid tumor is considered, it is desirable to produce|generate the antibody with respect to P-cadherin which can bring the patient of various cancers remedial profits.</p>
    <head xml:id="_2ff0350048">MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM</head>

    <p n="0006" xml:id="_2ff0350050">A) For example, in one Embodiment, an antibody or its antigen binding part has a large binding affinity with respect to P-cadherin (KD(P)) from E-cadherin (KD (E)).<lb>
        </lb>In one Embodiment, the antibody of this invention or its antigen binding part has 1.5 or more KD(E)/KD(P).<lb>
        </lb>In the further embodiment, the antibody of this invention or its antigen binding part has 500 or more [ 200 or more / 100 or more / 50 or more / 20 or more / 10 or more / 5 or more / 3 or more / 2 or more ] or 1000 or more KD(E)/KD(P).<lb>
        </lb>Since KD (E) value can become [ 0 ] very small, it is usually infinite to the value of KD(E)/KD(P).<lb>
        </lb>However, the upper limit of KD(E)/KD(P) can become 1x10&lt;6&gt; for the practical objective.<lb>

        </lb>Usually, there is no minimum in the value of IC50 measured by P-cadherin dependence cell-adhesion assay.<lb>
        </lb>However, it can be assumed for the practical objective that a minimum is about 1 pM.</p>
    <p n="0010" xml:id="_2ff0350071">E) In other embodiment, P-cadherin antibody or its part has IC50 100 nM or less measured by P-cadherin dependence cell aggregation assay.<lb>
        </lb>In the further embodiment, said IC50 is less than 50 nM, less than 40 nM, less than 20 nM, less than 10 nM, less than 1 nM, less than 500 pM, less than 200 pM, less than 100 pM, or less than 1 pM and it is measured by P-cadherin dependence cell aggregation assay.<lb>
        </lb>Usually, there is no minimum in the value of IC50 measured by P-cadherin dependence cell aggregation assay.<lb>

    <p n="0056" xml:id="_2ff0350248">It is known that the structural unit of a fundamental antibody contains a tetramer.<lb>
        </lb>Each tetramer consists of the two same pairs of a polypeptide chain|strand, and each pair has one "light" chain|strand (about 25 kDa) and one "heavy" chain|strand (about 50-70 kDa).<lb>
        </lb>The amino terminal part of each chain|strand contains the variable region which is mainly concerned in antigen recognition and which consists of about 100 - a 120 or more amino acid.<lb>
        </lb>The carboxy terminal|end part of each chain|strand prescribes|regulates the constant region which is mainly concerned in an effector function.<lb>
        </lb>A human light chain is classified into (kappa) and (lambda) light chain.<lb>
        </lb>The heavy chain is classified into (micro|micron|mu), (delta), (gamma), and (alpha) or (epsilon), and defines the isotype of an antibody as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively.<lb>
        </lb>A variable region and a constant region are couple|bonded within the heavy chain and a light chain by the "J" area|region which consists of about 12 or more amino acid, and the heavy chain also includes the "D" area|region which consists of about 3 or more amino acid.<lb>
        </lb>Generally, please refer (The whole is integrated in this specification by the reference for all the objective.) Fundamental Immunology and Chapter 7 (Paul, W. knitting|edition, the 2nd edition, Raven Press, New York state (1989)).<lb>
        </lb>Variable-region (VH and VL) of each pair of the heavy chain/light chain forms an antibody combining site.<lb>
        </lb>Therefore, for example, a perfect IgG antibody has two coupling|bond-regions.<lb>
        </lb>Two coupling|bond-regions are the same except bifunctionality or a bispecific antibody.</p>
    <p n="0057" xml:id="_2ff0350259">The variable region of the heavy chain and a light chain shows the same general structure of the framework region (FR) which is couple|bonded by three hypervariable regions called a complementarity determining region or CDR and which is preserve|saved comparatively.<lb>
        </lb>The term "variable" points out the arrangement|sequence of the specific part of a variable domain being large between antibodies, and differing, and it is used in the coupling|bonding and specificity with respect to the specific antigen of specific each antibody.<lb>
        </lb>However, the variability is not necessarily uniformly distributed over the whole variable domain of an antibody, and is concentrated in CDR isolate|separated by FR preserve|saved more highly.<lb>
        </lb>CDR of two chain|strands of each pair aligns by FR, and becomes combinable with a specific epitope by it.<lb>
