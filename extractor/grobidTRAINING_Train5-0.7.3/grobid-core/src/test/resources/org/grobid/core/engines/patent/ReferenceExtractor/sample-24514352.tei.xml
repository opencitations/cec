							The present invention relates to an improved fiber drafting
							assembly, and more particularly, relates to a novel housing
							member which is suitable for use in a fiber drafting assembly.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							Fiber drafting assemblies are known in the art and are employed for
							the purpose of rendering a source of fibrous material into finite
							fiber lengths. Generally, such a fiber drafting assembly includes
							means for feeding fibrous material to an opening roll which combs
							and drafts the fibrous material to form fibers of a finite
							length.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							Such fiber drafting assemblies are generally employed in the
							manufacture of a yarn. Besides combing and drafting the fibers
							from the fibrous material, the assembly may also achieve a
							substantial parallelization of the fibers. These fibers may then
							be twisted into a yarn material (with or without the addition of
							further fibers) or be utilized as a source of fibers for the
							manufacture of a composite yarn such as is shown in copending
							U.S. patent applications, Ser. Nos. 515,407 and 507,054. Both of
							these aforesaid copending applications teach compact apparatuses
							for the formation of composite yarns from particulated fibrous
							material -- i.e. fibers. Although the improved assembly of the
							present invention is applicable to such apparatuses, the
							invention may also be utilized in any fiber drafting assembly,
							irrespective of its use.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							Generally, the present invention provides a housing member suitable for use
							in a fiber drafting assembly and which housing member is adapted
							to receive and direct fibers doffed from an opening roll in a
							desired path.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							According to one aspect of the present invention, in a fiber drafting
							assembly having an opening roll, there is provided the
							improvement wherein the assembly includes a housing member
							extending about at least a portion of the circumference of said
							opening roll, said member having a groove located interiorly
							thereof to receive fibers doffed from said opening roll and to
							direct the fibers in a desired path.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
							fiber drafting assembly comprising a source of fibrous material,
							a rotatable opening roll, means for rotatably driving said
							opening roll, means for advancing said source of fibrous material
							to said opening roll, and a housing member extending about at
							least a portion of the circumference of said opening roll, said
							housing member having a groove located interiorly thereof adapted
							to receive fibers doffed from said opening roll, said groove
							being further characterized by having an initial relatively
							shallow and relatively wide portion tapering to a relatively deep
							and relatively narrow discharge portion in the direction of fiber
							advancement.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							In preferred aspects of the present invention, said groove has an
							increasing cross-sectional area in the direction of fiber
							advancement.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							In a still further aspect of the present invention, there is
							provided a housing member for placement about a portion of the
							circumference of an opening roll in a fiber drafting assembly,
							the surface of said housing member adjacent the circumferential
							surface of said opening roll having, in the direction of fiber
							advancement, a first groove formed therein, said first groove
							tapering to a non-grooved portion, and a further groove in said
							surface adapted to receive fibers doffed from said opening roll.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							In a still further aspect of the present invention, in a method of
							drafting fibrous material to form fibers, there is provided the
							improvement comprising the steps of supplying an assembly
							comprising an opening roll having a housing member with a groove
							located interiorly thereof placed circumferentially of said
							opening roll, feeding fibrous material to said opening roll,
							rotating said opening roll to have a peripheral velocity
							sufficiently high to draft said fibrous material and to doff the
							drafted fibers into said groove, and withdrawing said fibers from
							a discharge end of said groove.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							In the disclosure and claims of the present application, it will be
							understood that the term "opening roll" is meant to be generic to
							any roll or roller which functions to comb or draft fibers from a
							source of fibrous material. Synonymous terms employed in the art
							include, for example, lickerin rolls, drafting rolls, combing
							rolls, particulating rolls, needle rolls, etc.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							Generally, in an assembly wherein non-particulate fibrous material is
							combed or drafted and wherein a substantial parallelization of
							the fibers is achieved, there is included means for advancing the
							fibrous material to an opening roll. Such means may be any
							suitable and can include, for example, a first feed-in roll
							advancing a source of fibrous material to the opening roll.
							Normally, the opening roll is rotating at a substantially higher
							peripheral speed than the peripheral speed of the first or
							feed-in roll such that a combing and drafting action and
							parallelization of the fibers occurs upon the transfer of the
							fibers from the feed-in roll to the opening roll.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							After being completely transferred to the opening roll, the fibers
							have a tendency to be thrown off the roll due to the centrifugal
							force involved at the high rotational speed at which it is
							rotatably driven. In this respect, as will be appreciated, the
							centrifugal force can be substantial and will be sufficient to
							overcome the frictional force between the fibers and the teeth or
							needles of the opening roll which would normally tend to retain
							the fibers on the roll.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							The housing member of the present invention is adapted to act as a
							fiber receiving and directing means for the opening roll when
							they are "thrown off" or doffed therefrom. The housing member is
							held in a "fixed" position in the sense that it does not rotate
							with the opening roll. To this end, the member may be secured to
							any suitable non-movable portion of the apparatus such as the
							frame thereof by conventional means. However, it will be
							understood that the housing member may be movable or adjustable
							in that its position with respect to the opening roll may be
							changed. Furthermore, the assembly employing the housing member
							may have "universal" means for securing the member thereto
							whereby different sized housing members may be employed for
							different applications as will be discussed in greater detail
							hereinafter.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							The material of which the cover member is formed is substantially
							irrelevant to the invention; suitable metallic or plastic
							materials well known to those skilled in the art may be utilized.
							However, in this respect, it will be appreciated that the grooved
							portion which receive the doffed fibers should be of a
							substantially smooth finish to minimize friction and prevent any
							"snagging" of the fibers which are doffed from the opening roll.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							As aforementioned, the groove which receives the doffed fibers
							commences with a relatively shallow and wide portion and tapers
							to form a relatively deep and relatively narrow discharge or exit
							portion at one end thereof. In one embodiment, the
							cross-sectional area of the groove increases in the direction of
							fiber advancement and furthermore, the cross-sectional area may
							increase in a substantially linear relationship with respect to
							the arc of the groove for at least a substantial portion of the
							length thereof.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							In one particular aspect of the invention, there is provided a
							further groove within the surface of the housing member located
							adjacent to the circumferential surface of the opening roll.
							Details of this further groove will be described in greater
							detail in the illustrated embodiment; it suffices to say that
							such a further groove aids in the drafting of the fibers when a
							feed-in roll is employed as the means to advance the fibrous
							material to the opening roll.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							In a further aspect of the present invention, there may be provided
							air bleed means associated with the housing member and more
							particularly, with the first mentioned groove which receives the
							doffed fibers from the opening roll. In conjunction with the air
							bleed, there may be employed a source of pressurized fluidic
							material; this is not essential to the practice of the present
							invention and further details are evident in the description of
							the illustrated embodiment.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							The method of the invention, as aforementioned, comprises feeding
							fibrous material to the opening roll having the above described
							housing associated therewith, rotating the opening roll to have a
							high peripheral velocity whereby the fibers will be doffed into
							the groove of the housing member, and withdrawing said fibers
							from a discharge end of said groove. These fibers may then be
							employed in the manufacture of a yarn or for any desired purpose.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							As will be appreciated from the above description, the housing
							member provides substantial advantages in the drafting and
							combing of fibrous material. It is believed that these objects
							and advantages will become clear from the following detailed
							description of preferred embodiments in conjunction with the
							accompanying drawings, in which:

						<p xml:lang="en">
							The details of opening roll 18 are not illustrated since this roll
							may, if desired, be of any conventional construction such as
							shown in copending application Ser. No. 507,054.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							The fibrous material is fed to opening roll 18 by feed-in roll 10
							and a drafting and combing action of the material is achieved due
							to the higher peripheral velocity (with respect to feed-in roll
							10) at which opening roll 18 is driven. For example, while
							feed-in roll may have a peripheral velocity of between 2 and 40
							feet per minute, the peripheral velocity of opening roll 18 would
							be in the range of 4,000 and 8,000 feet per minute. Naturally,
							these peripheral velocities may be varied according to the
							desired results and operating parameters of the apparatus.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							As the fibrous material reaches the nip of rolls 10 and 18, the
							fibrous material is combed and drafted by the action of the fiber
							drafting means -- i.e. the needles or teeth, to form a plurality
							of finite fibers which are retained on opening roll 18. The
							fibers are also generally parallelized in the circumferential
							direction of the roll.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							As may be seen from the Figures, a housing member 24 is
							circumferentially located for a portion of the circumference of
							opening roll 18. This housing member extends for the width of the
							opening roll and it will now be described in greater detail.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							Housing member 24 preferably comprises an integral one-piece structure
							formed of a suitable material such as a metallic or plastics
							material which has the necessary strength -- e.g. aluminum or the
							like. Means for mounting housing member 24 may comprise those
							such as shown in the drawings wherein a plurality of threaded
							apertures such as designated by reference numeral 26 will be
							employed to mate with correspondingly threaded bolts or screws.
							In this respect, any means for mounting the same in a fixed
							relationship with respect to opening roll 18 may be employed.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							Housing member 24, as shown in the Figures, is of an overall arcuate
							configuration having a top surface 28, one end wall 30 arcuately
							merging with top surface 28 and a further end wall 32. The
							interior surface opposed to top surface 28 is configurated to
							operate in conjunction with opening roll 18 during various phases
							of the operation of the apparatus and will now be discussed.
							Initially, it will be noted that commencing at end wall 30, there
							is provided a channel 44 which is of decreasing dimensions
							(depthwise) to smoothly merge with a further portion 34 of the
							interior surface. As will be seen in the drawings, portion 34
							represents that portion of the interior surface most closely
							spaced to the opening roll.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							Following portion 34, there is formed a second groove having an initial
							portion 36 which is relatively wide -- i.e. it extends a
							substantial width of member 24. The groove has side walls 38 and
							40 which then taper inwardly to form a more narrow groove portion
							42. In the illustrated embodiment, the decreasing width of the
							groove proceeds contemporaneously with an increased depth
							thereof. In the preferred aspect, the decrease in width and
							increase in depth is such so that the cross-sectional area of the
							groove is increasing in the direction of fiber advancement or
							opening roll rotation.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							As the fibers are fed by feed-in roll 10, an initial combing or
							drafting action is performed which, as aforementioned, is due to
							the high rotational velocity of opening roll 18 vis-a-vis the
							rotational velocity of feed-in roll 10. This drafting or combing
							action is performed during the period of rotation of opening roll
							18 which is substantially coextensive with the length of first
							groove 44. Subsequently, the opening roll performs a straight
							transportation function for a portion of its rotation and this
							function is substantially coextensive with portion 34 of the
							housing member.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							As may be appreciated, the high peripheral velocity of opening roll
							18 will tend to throw off or doff the fibers due to a high
							centrifugal force. This force is sufficient to overcome the
							frictional force between the fibers and fiber drafting means and
							generally, the fibers commence to be doffed thereat. The fibers
							thus doffed from opening roll 18 into the groove are directed
							thereby and ejected or discharged onto a central collecting roll
							50 as will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							The fibrous material advanced by feed-in roll 12 rotating in the
							direction of arrow 16 is fed to a further opening roll 18'. Roll
							18' may be substantially identical in construction to opening
							roll 18 and for this reason, is not discussed in great detail
							herein. Similarly, a cover or housing member 24' is provided
							which is also substantially identical with respect to the housing
							member 24 and thus, need not be elaborated on; similar reference
							numerals with a prime are employed for similar components.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							The parallelized fibers from opening roll 18' are ejected onto the
							central collecting roll 50 which is journalled on a shaft 52
							whereby it is suitably rotated in the direction of arrow 54 by
							conventional means (not shown). Collecting roll 50 may be of the
							type described in copending patent application Ser. No. 507,054,
							i.e. it includes a central collecting trough for receiving the
							fibers from opening roll 18'. The fibers thus transferred thereon
							are transported and combined with fibers from opening roll 18 and
							a composite yarn form as described in the aforementioned
							copending application is formed.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							As will be seen from FIG. 1, a further cover member 56 of a
							one-piece structure is provided for a portion of the periphery of
							both opening roll 18' and collecting roll 50. The purpose of
							cover member 56 is to aerodynamically direct the fibers which
							have been transferred from opening roll 18' in their proper
							direction. Thus, as aforementioned, the rolls are operating at
							extremely high peripheral velocities and during the transfer of
							the fiber from opening roll 18', there is the tendency for the
							fibers to "bounce" from the central collecting trough onto which
							they are directed and up in the air. As will be seen from the
							Figures, cover member 56 has a first portion 58 about a portion
							of the periphery of roll 18' and a further portion 60 about the
							periphery of roll 50 with the junction point 62 being in a
							closely spaced relationship to the surface of roll 18'. As the
							fibers are doffed from the groove in member 24' due to
							centrifugal force, member 60 will aerodynamically direct the
							fibers onto the central collecting channel or trough of roll 50
							and tend to retain them in their proper position in the channel.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							It will also be noted that a housing member 70 is provided about
							the bottom periphery of roll 18. End wall 72 of member 70 is of
							an angled construction to also assist in the aerodynamic
							functioning of the doffing of the fibers onto the central
							collecting roll 50.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							In one embodiment of the present invention, there may be provided
							pneumatic means to maintain the speed of the fibers which are
							travelling in the grooved housing member. To this end one or more
							air jets may be employed directing a source of pressurized air to
							the groove in the direction of travel of the fibers; the
							necessity and desirability of having such air jets depends on
							factors known to those skilled in the art -- i.e. the type of
							fiber and length thereof.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							Due to the high velocity at which the opening rolls are travelling,
							there is created a reduced pressure area proximate to portion 36
							of the groove. This aids in the doffing of the fibers from the
							opening roll.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							A further embodiment is illustrated in FIGS. 5 to 7 and reference
							will now be made thereto. In this respect, these Figures
							illustrate a housing member similar to that illustrated in FIGS.
							2 to 4 and similar reference numerals with a prime are employed
							for identical components.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							In greater detail, the housing member 24' illustrated in FIGS. 5 to
							7 employs an air bleed 80. Air bleed 80 may be any suitable
							conduit or aperture in the housing and preferably communicates
							with the relatively shallow and wide portion 36' of the groove.
							Even more preferably, air bleed 80 is positioned substantially
							tangentially to the groove.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							As aforementioned, pneumatic means may be employed to maintain or
							boost the speed of the fibers which are doffed into the groove.
							Thus, a source of pressurized gaseous material may be fed through
							air bleed 80 to achieve this end. The source of pressurized
							gaseous material such as air may be any suitable; it will be
							understood that the pressure at which the gaseous material is fed
							will be relatively low so as to not interfere or prevent the
							doffing of the fibers from the opening roll into the groove.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							In the design of a housing member such as is designated by
							reference numeral 24 or 24', portion 34 or 34' must be of a
							sufficient length to permit a sufficient combing and drafting
							action on the fibrous material. As will be appreciated, if the
							front end of a fiber has commenced being doffed into the groove
							while the tail end is still being fed in, a "tumbling" action
							will occur at the front end of the fiber. This is undesirable and
							accordingly, portion 34 of the housing member is of a sufficient
							length to prevent this tumbling action from occurring.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							As previously discussed, the overall length of a housing member as
							taught by the present invention may be variable depending on the
							type of fibers and length of fibers employed. To this end,
							preferably universal mounting means are employed whereby the
							apparatus may receive various different cover members by their
							universal mounting means. This would be particularly the case for
							longer fibers wherein the take off point would be more to the
							right of roll 18 as shown in FIG. 1.
						</p>
						<p xml:lang="en">
							It will be obvious from the above description that many changes and
							modifications may be made to the above described embodiment
							without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention
							which is not limited thereby, but rather by the claims appended
							hereto.
