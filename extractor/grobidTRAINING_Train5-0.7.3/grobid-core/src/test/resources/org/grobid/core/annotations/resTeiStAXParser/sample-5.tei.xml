								<p xml:id="_65348a">BACKGROUND</p>
								<p xml:id="_77bf76" n="0006">Paper is widely used to display and record information. Printed information is easier to read than information displayed on a computer screen. Hand-drawing and
									handwriting afford greater richness of expression than input via a computer keyboard and mouse. Moreover, paper doesn't run on batteries, can be read in bright light, more robustly accepts
									coffee spills, and is portable and disposable.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_968fa0" n="0007">Online publication has many advantages over traditional paper-based publication. From a consumer's point of view, information is available on demand, information can be
									navigated via hypertext links, searched and automatically personalized.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0ac795" n="0008">From the publisher's point of view, the costs of printing and physical distribution are eliminated, and the publication becomes more attractive to the advertisers who
									pay for it because it can be targeted to specific demographics and linked to product sites.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d9c9ce" n="0009">Online publication also has disadvantages. Computer screens are inferior to paper. At the same quality as a magazine page, an SVGA computer screen displays only about a
									fifth as much information. Both CRTs and LCDs have brightness and contrast problems, particularly when ambient light is strong, while ink on paper, being reflective rather than emissive, is
									both bright and sharp in ambient light.

								<p xml:id="_bbe9b1" n="0010">In accordance with the invention, there is provided a method of selecting and delivering a greeting card, including:</p>
								<p xml:id="_044878" n="0011">providing a document with details of a selection of available greeting cards, the document having at least one user-interactive element with which a user interacts to
									select a card using a sensing device adapted to transmit interaction data to a computer system;
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f7e034" n="0012">indicating selection of a card using the sensing device;</p>
								<p xml:id="_aad45b" n="0013">including a message using the sensing device; and</p>
								<p xml:id="_2bdaec" n="0014">sending the card to a recipient address via the computer system.</p>
								<p xml:id="_4414a2" n="0015">In another aspect, there is provided a method of enabling selection and delivery of a greeting card, including:</p>
								<p xml:id="_738ba2" n="0016">obtaining a document with details of a selection of available greeting cards, the document having at least one user-interactive element with which a user interacts to
									select a card using a sensing device adapted to transmit interaction data to a computer system;
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_178aae" n="0017">receiving, in the computer system, data indicating selection of a card including a message in the selected card, the message being user specified using the sensing
									device; and
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5ebfdf" n="0018">sending the card to a recipient address via the computer system.</p>
								<p xml:id="_67d0ec" n="0019">Preferably, the details are presented as a list of card categories and images of the greeting cards of each category are printed for viewing in a further document by
									selecting the respective category using the sensing device.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_31ac5e" n="0020">Preferably, the step of including a message comprises selecting a message from a list of messages and the list is preferably provided in a further document which is
									printed after the card is selected, the further document having associated user-interactive elements for selection of the message. Alternatively or additionally, the step of including a
									message comprises recording a customised message applied with the device to a message region of the document by capturing associated interaction data transmitted during movement of the
									device.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f7e4ea" n="0021">Preferably, the step of sending the card includes selecting the recipient address, using the device, from an address list provided with user-interactive elements.
									Alternatively, the step of sending the card includes writing the recipient address in an address field of a form using the sensing device and capturing the writing by recording the associated
									interaction data.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d05433" n="0022">The recipient address may correspond to a printer address and the card is delivered by printing at that address. Alternatively, the recipient address corresponds to an
									electronic mail address and an image of the card is delivered to that address. As a further alternative the recipient address corresponds to a street address and the card is sent to a
									proximate mail service for printing and delivery to the street address.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_af8a4e" n="0023">Preferably, a preview of the card and message is provided in a further document for review prior to sending.</p>
								<p xml:id="_e0c86b" n="0024">Preferably, the document includes coded data indicative of an identity of the document and of the at least one interactive element, and wherein the method includes
									receiving, in the computer system, indicating data from the sensing device regarding the identity of the document and a position of the sensing device relative to the document in order to
									identify the document and determine when the sensing device is used to interact with the element. The method may further include receiving, in the computer system, movement data regarding
									movement of the sensing device relative to the document with the sensing device preferably sensing its movement relative to the document using the coded data, and identifying the request in
									the computer system from the movement being at least partially within a zone associated with the interactive element. The coded data is preferably substantially invisible in the visible
									spectrum.

									references to a map of the surface maintained in a computer system. The map references can be queried by an appropriate sensing device. Depending upon the specific implementation, the map
									references may be encoded visibly or invisibly, and defined in such a way that a local query on the mapped surface yields an unambiguous map reference both within the map and among different
									maps. The computer system can contain information about features on the mapped surface, and such information can be retrieved based on map references supplied by a sensing device used with
									the mapped surface. The information thus retrieved can take the form of actions which are initiated by the computer system on behalf of the operator in response to the operator's interaction
									with the surface features.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1709a2" n="0105">In its preferred form, the netpage system relies on the production of, and human interaction with, netpages. These are pages of text, graphics and images printed on
									ordinary paper, but which work like interactive web pages. Information is encoded on each page using ink which is substantially invisible to the unaided human eye. The ink, however, and
									thereby the coded data, can be sensed by an optically imaging pen and transmitted to the netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f8217" n="0106">In the preferred form, active buttons and hyperlinks on each page can be clicked with the pen to request information from the network or to signal preferences to a
									network server. In one embodiment, text written by hand on a netpage is automatically recognized and converted to computer text in the netpage system, allowing forms to be filled in. In other
									embodiments, signatures recorded on a netpage are automatically verified, allowing e-commerce transactions to be securely authorized.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0c3540" n="0107">As illustrated in FIG. 1, a printed netpage 1 can represent a interactive form which can be filled in by the user both physically, on the printed page, and
									&quot;electronically&quot;, via communication between the pen and the netpage system. The example shows a &quot;Request&quot; form containing name and address fields and a submit button. The
									netpage consists of graphic data 2 printed using visible ink, and coded data 3 printed as a collection of tags 4 using invisible ink. The corresponding page description 5, stored on the
									netpage network, describes the individual elements of the netpage. In particular it describes the type and spatial extent (zone) of each interactive element (i.e. text field or button in the
									example), to allow the netpage system to correctly interpret input via the netpage. The submit button 6, for example, has a zone 7 which corresponds to the spatial extent of the corresponding
									graphic 8.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4b690e" n="0108">As illustrated in FIG. 2, the netpage pen 101, a preferred form of which is shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 and described in more detail below, works in conjunction with a
									netpage printer 601, an Internet-connected printing appliance for home, office or mobile use. The pen is wireless and communicates securely with the netpage printer via a short-range radio
									link 9.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7d3801" n="0109">The netpage printer 601, a preferred form of which is shown in FIGS. 11 to 13 and described in more detail below, is able to deliver, periodically or on demand,
									personalized newspapers, magazines, catalogs, greeting cards and other publications, all printed at high quality as interactive netpages. Unlike a personal computer, the netpage printer is an
									appliance which can be, for example, wall-mounted adjacent to an area where the morning news is first consumed, such as in a user's kitchen, near a breakfast table, or near the household's
									point of departure for the day. It also comes in tabletop, desktop, portable and miniature versions.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_62a805" n="0110">Netpages printed at their point of consumption combine the ease-of-use of paper with the timeliness and interactivity of an interactive medium.</p>
								<p xml:id="_44d96c" n="0111">As shown in FIG. 2, the netpage pen 101 interacts with the coded data on a printed netpage 1 and communicates, via a short-range radio link 9, the interaction to a
									netpage printer. The printer 601 sends the interaction to the relevant netpage page server 10 for interpretation. In appropriate circumstances, the page server sends a corresponding message
									to application computer software running on a netpage application server 13. The application server may in turn send a response which is printed on the originating printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d68ffb" n="0112">The netpage system is made considerably more convenient in the preferred embodiment by being used in conjunction with high-speed microelectromechanical system (MEMS)
									based inkjet (Memjet(TM)) printers. In the preferred form of this technology, relatively high-speed and high-quality printing is made more affordable to consumers. In its preferred form, a
									netpage publication has the physical characteristics of a traditional newsmagazine, such as a set of letter-size glossy pages printed in full color on both sides, bound together for easy
									navigation and comfortable handling.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7574e0" n="0113">The netpage printer exploits the growing availability of broadband Internet access. Cable service is available to 95% of households in the United States, and cable
									modem service offering broadband Internet access is already available to 20% of these. The netpage printer can also operate with slower connections, but with longer delivery times and lower
									image quality. Indeed, the netpage system can be enabled using existing consumer inkjet and laser printers, although the system will operate more slowly and will therefore be less acceptable
									from a consumer's point of view. In other embodiments, the netpage system is hosted on a private intranet. In still other embodiments, the netpage system is hosted on a single computer or
									computer-enabled device, such as a printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbdc6f" n="0114">Netpage publication servers 14 on the netpage network are configured to deliver print-quality publications to netpage printers. Periodical publications are delivered
									automatically to subscribing netpage printers via pointcasting and multicasting Internet protocols. Personalized publications are filtered and formatted according to individual user profiles.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c1de77" n="0115">A netpage printer can be configured to support any number of pens, and a pen can work with any number of netpage printers. In the preferred implementation, each netpage
									pen has a unique identifier. A household may have a collection of colored netpage pens, one assigned to each member of the family. This allows each user to maintain a distinct profile with
									respect to a netpage publication server or application server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_478f3f" n="0116">A netpage pen can also be registered with a netpage registration server 11 and linked to one or more payment card accounts. This allows e-commerce payments to be
									securely authorized using the netpage pen. The netpage registration server compares the signature captured by the netpage pen with a previously registered signature, allowing it to
									authenticate the user's identity to an e-commerce server. Other biometrics can also be used to verify identity. A version of the netpage pen includes fingerprint scanning, verified in a
									similar way by the netpage registration server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4617cb" n="0117">Although a netpage printer may deliver periodicals such as the morning newspaper without user intervention, it can be configured never to deliver unsolicited junk mail.
									In its preferred form, it only delivers periodicals from subscribed or otherwise authorized sources. In this respect, the netpage printer is unlike a fax machine or e-mail account which is
									visible to any junk mailer who knows the telephone number or email address.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_75e850">1 Netpage System Architecture</p>
								<p xml:id="_d269d9" n="0118">Each object model in the system is described using a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram. A class diagram consists of a set of object classes connected by
									relationships, and two kinds of relationships are of interest here: associations and generalizations. An association represents some kind of relationship between objects, i.e. between
									instances of classes. A generalization relates actual classes, and can be understood in the following way: if a class is thought of as the set of all objects of that class, and class A is a
									generalization of class B, then B is simply a subset of A. The UML does not directly support second-order modelling-i.e. classes of classes.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fcc8c4" n="0119">Each class is drawn as a rectangle labelled with the name of the class. It contains a list of the attributes of the class, separated from the name by a horizontal line,
									and a list of the operations of the class, separated from the attribute list by a horizontal line. In the class diagrams which follow, however, operations are never modelled.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_930450" n="0120">An association is drawn as a line joining two classes, optionally labelled at either end with the multiplicity of the association. The default multiplicity is one. An
									asterisk (*) indicates a multiplicity of &quot;many&quot;, i.e. zero or more. Each association is optionally labelled with its name, and is also optionally labelled at either end with the
									role of the corresponding class. An open diamond indicates an aggregation association (&quot;is-part-of&quot;), and is drawn at the aggregator end of the association line.</p>
								<p xml:id="_65d51d" n="0121">A generalization relationship (&quot;is-a&quot;) is drawn as a solid line joining two classes, with an arrow (in the form of an open triangle) at the generalization
									end.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9a7424" n="0122">When a class diagram is broken up into multiple diagrams, any class which is duplicated is shown with a dashed outline in all but the main diagram which defines it. It
									is shown with attributes only where it is defined.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a08e0">1.1 Netpages</p>
								<p xml:id="_81174a" n="0123">Netpages are the foundation on which a netpage network is built. They provide a paper-based user interface to published information and interactive services.</p>
								<p xml:id="_94b170" n="0124">A netpage consists of a printed page (or other surface region) invisibly tagged with references to an online description of the page. The online page description is
									maintained persistently by a netpage page server. The page description describes the visible layout and content of the page, including text, graphics and images. It also describes the input
									elements on the page, including buttons, hyperlinks, and input fields. A netpage allows markings made with a netpage pen on its surface to be simultaneously captured and processed by the
									netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b6bc7b" n="0125">Multiple netpages can share the same page description. However, to allow input through otherwise identical pages to be distinguished, each netpage is assigned a unique
									page identifier. This page ID has sufficient precision to distinguish between a very large number of netpages.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5634bd" n="0126">Each reference to the page description is encoded in a printed tag. The tag identifies the unique page on which it appears, and thereby indirectly identifies the page
									description. The tag also identifies its own position on the page. Characteristics of the tags are described in more detail below.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_8caa37" n="0127">Tags are printed in infrared-absorptive ink on any substrate which is infrared-reflective, such as ordinary paper. Near-infrared wavelengths are invisible to the human
									eye but are easily sensed by a solid-state image sensor with an appropriate filter.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_27362c" n="0128">A tag is sensed by an area image sensor in the netpage pen, and the tag data is transmitted to the netpage system via the nearest netpage printer. The pen is wireless
									and communicates with the netpage printer via a short-range radio link. Tags are sufficiently small and densely arranged that the pen can reliably image at least one tag even on a single
									click on the page. It is important that the pen recognize the page ID and position on every interaction with the page, since the interaction is stateless. Tags are error-correctably encoded
									to make them partially tolerant to surface damage.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_972a8e" n="0129">The netpage page server maintains a unique page instance for each printed netpage, allowing it to maintain a distinct set of user-supplied values for input fields in
									the page description for each printed netpage.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c68ff4" n="0130">The relationship between the page description, the page instance, and the printed netpage is shown in FIG. 4. The page instance is associated with both the netpage
									printer which printed it and, if known, the netpage user who requested it.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f4c7d7">1.2 Netpage Tags</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbf070">1.2.1 Tag Data Content</p>
								<p xml:id="_a44ff8" n="0131">In a preferred form, each tag identifies the region in which it appears, and the location of that tag within the region. A tag may also contain flags which relate to
									the region as a whole or to the tag. One or more flag bits may, for example, signal a tag sensing device to provide feedback indicative of a function associated with the immediate area of the
									tag, without the sensing device having to refer to a description of the region. A netpage pen may, for example, illuminate an &quot;active area&quot; LED when in the zone of a hyperlink.</p>
								<p xml:id="_25fa3a" n="0132">As will be more clearly explained below, in a preferred embodiment, each tag contains an easily recognized invariant structure which aids initial detection, and which
									assists in minimizing the effect of any warp induced by the surface or by the sensing process. The tags preferably tile the entire page, and are sufficiently small and densely arranged that
									the pen can reliably image at least one tag even on a single click on the page. It is important that the pen recognize the page ID and position on every interaction with the page, since the
									interaction is stateless.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c5c2c2" n="0133">
									In a preferred embodiment, the region to which a tag refers coincides with an entire page, and the region ID encoded in the tag is therefore synonomous with the page ID of the page on which
									the tag appears. In other embodiments, the region to which a tag refers can be an arbitrary subregion of a page or other surface. For example, it can coincide with the zone of an interactive
									element, in which case the region ID can directly identify the interactive element.

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_976706" n="0134">Each tag contains 120 bits of information, typically allocated as shown in Table 1. Assuming a maximum tag density of 64 per square inch, a 16-bit tag ID supports a
									region size of up to 1024 square inches. Larger regions can be mapped continuously without increasing the tag ID precision simply by using abutting regions and maps. The 100-bit region ID
									allows 2&lt;100 &gt; (10&lt;30 &gt; or a million trillion trillion) different regions to be uniquely identified.</p>
								<p xml:id="_2600b9">1.2.2 Tag Data Encoding</p>
								<p xml:id="_e12e82" n="0135">The 120 bits of tag data are redundantly encoded using a (15, 5) Reed-Solomon code. This yields 360 encoded bits consisting of 6 codewords of 15 4-bit symbols each. The
									(15, 5) code allows up to 5 symbol errors to be corrected per codeword, i.e. it is tolerant of a symbol error rate of up to 33% per codeword.</p>
								<p xml:id="_f58fe6" n="0136">Each 4-bit symbol is represented in a spatially coherent way in the tag, and the symbols of the six codewords are interleaved spatially within the tag. This ensures
									that a burst error (an error affecting multiple spatially adjacent bits) damages a minimum number of symbols overall and a minimum number of symbols in any one codeword, thus maximising the
									likelihood that the burst error can be fully corrected.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d28cd0">1.2.3 Physical Tag Structure</p>
								<p xml:id="_f3859a" n="0137">The physical representation of the tag, shown in FIG. 5, includes fixed target structures 15, 16, 17 and variable data areas 18. The fixed target structures allow a
									sensing device such as the netpage pen to detect the tag and infer its three-dimensional orientation relative to the sensor. The data areas contain representations of the individual bits of
									the encoded tag data.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f78258" n="0138">To achieve proper tag reproduction, the tag is rendered at a resolution of 256*256 dots. When printed at 1600 dots per inch this yields a tag with a diameter of about 4
									mm. At this resolution the tag is designed to be surrounded by a &quot;quiet area&quot; of radius 16 dots. Since the quiet area is also contributed by adjacent tags, it only adds 16 dots to
									the effective diameter of the tag.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3530a4" n="0139">The tag includes six target structures. A detection ring 15 allows the sensing device to initially detect the tag. The ring is easy to detect because it is rotationally
									invariant and because a simple correction of its aspect ratio removes most of the effects of perspective distortion. An orientation axis 16 allows the sensing device to determine the
									approximate planar orientation of the tag due to the yaw of the sensor. The orientation axis is skewed to yield a unique orientation. Four perspective targets 17 allow the sensing device to
									infer an accurate two-dimensional perspective transform of the tag and hence an accurate three-dimensional position and orientation of the tag relative to the sensor.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_42fc4f" n="0140">All target structures are redundantly large to improve their immunity to noise.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0f502a" n="0141">The overall tag shape is circular. This supports, amongst other things, optimal tag packing on an irregular triangular grid. In combination with the circular detection
									ring, this makes a circular arrangement of data bits within the tag optimal. To maximise its size, each data bit is represented by a radial wedge in the form of an area bounded by two radial
									lines and two concentric circular arcs. Each wedge has a minimum dimension of 8 dots at 1600 dpi and is designed so that its base (its inner arc), is at least equal to this minimum dimension.
									The height of the wedge in the radial direction is always equal to the minimum dimension. Each 4-bit data symbol is represented by an array of 2*2 wedges.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_48ab70" n="0142">The 15 4-bit data symbols of each of the six codewords are allocated to the four concentric symbol rings 18a to 18d in interleaved fashion. Symbols are allocated
									alternately in circular progression around the tag.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3eaec5" n="0143">The interleaving is designed to maximise the average spatial distance between any two symbols of the same codeword.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a4e322" n="0144">In order to support &quot;single-click&quot; interaction with a tagged region via a sensing device, the sensing device must be able to see at least one entire tag in
									its field of view no matter where in the region or at what orientation it is positioned. The required diameter of the field of view of the sensing device is therefore a function of the size
									and spacing of the tags.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a1f9a0" n="0145">Assuming a circular tag shape, the minimum diameter of the sensor field of view is obtained when the tags are tiled on a equilateral triangular grid, as shown in FIG.
									6.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6cfff7">1.2.5 Tag Image Processing and Decoding</p>
								<p xml:id="_e64847" n="0146">The tag image processing and decoding performed by a sensing device such as the netpage pen is shown in FIG. 7. While a captured image is being acquired from the image
									sensor, the dynamic range of the image is determined (at 20). The center of the range is then chosen as the binary threshold for the image 21. The image is then thresholded and segmented into
									connected pixel regions (i.e. shapes 23) (at 22). Shapes which are too small to represent tag target structures are discarded. The size and centroid of each shape is also computed.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_52f6a9" n="0147">Binary shape moments 25 are then computed (at 24) for each shape, and these provide the basis for subsequently locating target structures. Central shape moments are by
									their nature invariant of position, and can be easily made invariant of scale, aspect ratio and rotation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1f4c58" n="0148">The ring target structure 15 is the first to be located (at 26). A ring has the advantage of being very well behaved when perspective-distorted. Matching proceeds by
									aspect-normalizing and rotation-normalizing each shape's moments. Once its second-order moments are normalized the ring is easy to recognize even if the perspective distortion was
									significant. The ring's original aspect and rotation 27 together provide a useful approximation of the perspective transform.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_91d2ca" n="0149">The axis target structure 16 is the next to be located (at 28). Matching proceeds by applying the ring's normalizations to each shape's moments, and
									rotation-normalizing the resulting moments. Once its second-order moments are normalized the axis target is easily recognized. Note that one third order moment is required to disambiguate the
									two possible orientations of the axis. The shape is deliberately skewed to one side to make this possible. Note also that it is only possible to rotation-normalize the axis target after it
									has had the ring's normalizations applied, since the perspective distortion can hide the axis target's axis. The axis target's original rotation provides a useful approximation of the tag's
									rotation due to pen yaw 29.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b02ffc" n="0150">The four perspective target structures 17 are the last to be located (at 30). Good estimates of their positions are computed based on their known spatial relationships
									to the ring and axis targets, the aspect and rotation of the ring, and the rotation of the axis. Matching proceeds by applying the ring's normalizations to each shape's moments. Once their
									second-order moments are normalized the circular perspective targets are easy to recognize, and the target closest to each estimated position is taken as a match. The original centroids of
									the four perspective targets are then taken to be the perspective-distorted corners 31 of a square of known size in tag space, and an eight-degree-of-freedom perspective transform 33 is
									inferred (at 32) based on solving the well-understood equations relating the four tag-space and image-space point pairs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a57fb8" n="0151">The inferred tag-space to image-space perspective transform is used to project (at 36) each known data bit position in tag space into image space where the real-valued
									position is used to bilinearly interpolate (at 36) the four relevant adjacent pixels in the input image. The previously computed image threshold 21 is used to threshold the result to produce
									the final bit value 37.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_94ece3" n="0152">Once all 360 data bits 37 have been obtained in this way, each of the six 60-bit Reed-Solomon codewords is decoded (at 38) to yield 20 decoded bits 39, or 120 decoded
									bits in total. Note that the codeword symbols are sampled in codeword order, so that codewords are implicitly de-interleaved during the sampling process.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7b4194" n="0153">The ring target 15 is only sought in a subarea of the image whose relationship to the image guarantees that the ring, if found, is part of a complete tag. If a complete
									tag is not found and successfully decoded, then no pen position is recorded for the current frame. Given adequate processing power and ideally a non-minimal field of view 193, an alternative
									strategy involves seeking another tag in the current image.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7c1be3" n="0154">The obtained tag data indicates the identity of the region containing the tag and the position of the tag within the region. An accurate position 35 of the pen nib in
									the region, as well as the overall orientation 35 of the pen, is then inferred (at 34) from the perspective transform 33 observed on the tag and the known spatial relationship between the
									pen's physical axis and the pen's optical axis.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d3d0f6">1.2.6 Tag Map</p>
								<p xml:id="_b62d2b" n="0155">Decoding a tag results in a region ID, a tag ID, and a tag-relative pen transform. Before the tag ID and the tag-relative pen location can be translated into an
									absolute location within the tagged region, the location of the tag within the region must be known. This is given by a tag map, a function which maps each tag ID in a tagged region to a
									corresponding location. The tag map class diagram is shown in FIG. 22, as part of the netpage printer class diagram.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a93dcc" n="0156">A tag map reflects the scheme used to tile the surface region with tags, and this can vary according to surface type. When multiple tagged regions share the same tiling
									scheme and the same tag numbering scheme, they can also share the same tag map.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_98e76d" n="0157">The tag map for a region must be retrievable via the region ID. Thus, given a region ID, a tag ID and a pen transform, the tag map can be retrieved, the tag ID can be
									translated into an absolute tag location within the region, and the tag-relative pen location can be added to the tag location to yield an absolute pen location within the region.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d3a358">1.2.7 Tagging Schemes</p>
								<p xml:id="_fdf6d4" n="0158">Two distinct surface coding schemes are of interest, both of which use the tag structure described earlier in this section. The preferred coding scheme uses
									&quot;location-indicating&quot; tags as already discussed. An alternative coding scheme uses object-indicating tags.</p>
								<p xml:id="_51a5ad" n="0159">A location-indicating tag contains a tag ID which, when translated through the tag map associated with the tagged region, yields a unique tag location within the
									region. The tag-relative location of the pen is added to this tag location to yield the location of the pen within the region. This in turn is used to determine the location of the pen
									relative to a user interface element in the page description associated with the region. Not only is the user interface element itself identified, but a location relative to the user
									interface element is identified. Location-indicating tags therefore trivially support the capture of an absolute pen path in the zone of a particular user interface element.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f4c689" n="0160">An object-indicating tag contains a tag ID which directly identifies a user interface element in the page description associated with the region. All the tags in the
									zone of the user interface element identify the user interface element, making them all identical and therefore indistinguishable. Object-indicating tags do not, therefore, support the
									capture of an absolute pen path. They do, however, support the capture of a relative pen path. So long as the position sampling frequency exceeds twice the encountered tag frequency, the
									displacement from one sampled pen position to the next within a stroke can be unambiguously determined.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6c5b5e" n="0161">With either tagging scheme, the tags function in cooperation with associated visual elements on the netpage as user interactive elements in that a user can interact
									with the printed page using an appropriate sensing device in order for tag data to be read by the sensing device and for an appropriate response to be generated in the netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b4ecf6">1.3 Document and Page Descriptions</p>
								<p xml:id="_48642d" n="0162">A preferred embodiment of a document and page description class diagram is shown in FIGS. 25 and 26.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdb489" n="0163">In the netpage system a document is described at three levels. At the most abstract level the document 836 has a hierarchical structure whose terminal elements 839 are
									associated with content objects 840 such as text objects, text style objects, image objects, etc. Once the document is printed on a printer with a particular page size and according to a
									particular user's scale factor preference, the document is paginated and otherwise formatted. Formatted terminal elements 835 will in some cases be associated with content objects which are
									different from those associated with their corresponding terminal elements, particularly where the content objects are style-related. Each printed instance of a document and page is also
									described separately, to allow input captured through a particular page instance 830 to be recorded separately from input captured through other instances of the same page description.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bcbdba" n="0164">The presence of the most abstract document description on the page server allows a user to request a copy of a document without being forced to accept the source
									document's specific format. The user may be requesting a copy through a printer with a different page size, for example. Conversely, the presence of the formatted document description on the
									page server allows the page server to efficiently interpret user actions on a particular printed page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_912ca5" n="0165">A formatted document 834 consists of a set of formatted page descriptions 5, each of which consists of a set of formatted terminal elements 835. Each formatted element
									has a spatial extent or zone 58 on the page. This defines the active area of input elements such as hyperlinks and input fields.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_64ee08" n="0166">A document instance 831 corresponds to a formatted document 834. It consists of a set of page instances 830, each of which corresponds to a page description 5 of the
									formatted document. Each page instance 830 describes a single unique printed netpage 1, and records the page ID 50 of the netpage. A page instance is not part of a document instance if it
									represents a copy of a page requested in isolation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f487a6" n="0167">A page instance consists of a set of terminal element instances 832. An element instance only exists if it records instance-specific information. Thus, a hyperlink
									instance exists for a hyperlink element because it records a transaction ID 55 which is specific to the page instance, and a field instance exists for a field element because it records input
									specific to the page instance. An element instance does not exist, however, for static elements such as textflows.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a3b41f" n="0168">A terminal element can be a static element 843, a hyperlink element 844, a field element 845 or a page server command element 846, as shown in FIG. 27. A static element
									843 can be a style element 847 with an associated style object 854, a textflow element 848 with an associated styled text object 855, an image element 849 with an associated image element
									856, a graphic element 850 with an associated graphic object 857, a video clip element 851 with an associated video clip object 858, an audio clip element 852 with an associated audio clip
									object 859, or a script element 853 with an associated script object 860, as shown in FIG. 28.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2f3fa3" n="0169">A page instance has a background field 833 which is used to record any digital ink captured on the page which does not apply to a specific input element.</p>
								<p xml:id="_3fc7fa" n="0170">In the preferred form of the invention, a tag map 811 is associated with each page instance to allow tags on the page to be translated into locations on the page.</p>
								<p xml:id="_69f129">1.4 The Netpage Network</p>
								<p xml:id="_249bce" n="0171">In a preferred embodiment, a netpage network consists of a distributed set of netpage page servers 10, netpage registration servers 11, netpage ID servers 12, netpage
									application servers 13, netpage publication servers 14, and netpage printers 601 connected via a network 19 such as the Internet, as shown in FIG. 3.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_790974" n="0172">The netpage registration server 11 is a server which records relationships between users, pens, printers, applications and publications, and thereby authorizes various
									network activities. It authenticates users and acts as a signing proxy on behalf of authenticated users in application transactions. It also provides handwriting recognition services. As
									described above, a netpage page server 10 maintains persistent information about page descriptions and page instances. The netpage network includes any number of page servers, each handling a
									subset of page instances. Since a page server also maintains user input values for each page instance, clients such as netpage printers send netpage input directly to the appropriate page
									server. The page server interprets any such input relative to the description of the corresponding page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_edf5ce" n="0173">A netpage ID server 12 allocates document IDs 51 on demand, and provides load-balancing of page servers via its ID allocation scheme.</p>
								<p xml:id="_2a852c" n="0174">A netpage printer uses the Internet Distributed Name System (DNS), or similar, to resolve a netpage page ID 50 into the network address of the netpage page server
									handling the corresponding page instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a0ef5c" n="0175">A netpage application server 13 is a server which hosts interactive netpage applications. A netpage publication server 14 is an application server which publishes
									netpage documents to netpage printers. They are described in detail in Section 2.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_949c58" n="0176">Netpage servers can be hosted on a variety of network server platforms from manufacturers such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun. Multiple netpage servers can run
									concurrently on a single host, and a single server can be distributed over a number of hosts. Some or all of the functionality provided by netpage servers, and in particular the functionality
									provided by the ID server and the page server, can also be provided directly in a netpage appliance such as a netpage printer, in a computer workstation, or on a local network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f7e6a2">1.5 The Netpage Printer</p>
								<p xml:id="_2809c7" n="0177">The netpage printer 601 is an appliance which is registered with the netpage system and prints netpage documents on demand and via subscription. Each printer has a
									unique printer ID 62, and is connected to the netpage network via a network such as the Internet, ideally via a broadband connection.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bd64ff" n="0178">Apart from identity and security settings in non-volatile memory, the netpage printer contains no persistent storage. As far as a user is concerned, &quot;the network
									is the computer&quot;. Netpages function interactively across space and time with the help of the distributed netpage page servers 10, independently of particular netpage printers.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b08b66" n="0179">The netpage printer receives subscribed netpage documents from netpage publication servers 14. Each document is distributed in two parts: the page layouts, and the
									actual text and image objects which populate the pages. Because of personalization, page layouts are typically specific to a particular subscriber and so are pointcast to the subscriber's
									printer via the appropriate page server. Text and image objects, on the other hand, are typically shared with other subscribers, and so are multicast to all subscribers' printers and the
									appropriate page servers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_cfb3ae" n="0180">The netpage publication server optimizes the segmentation of document content into pointcasts and multicasts. After receiving the pointcast of a document's page
									layouts, the printer knows which multicasts, if any, to listen to.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3015f" n="0181">Once the printer has received the complete page layouts and objects that define the document to be printed, it can print the document.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdf74a" n="0182">The printer rasterizes and prints odd and even pages simultaneously on both sides of the sheet. It contains duplexed print engine controllers 760 and print engines
									utilizing Memjet(TM) printheads 350 for this purpose.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4e28fe" n="0183">The printing process consists of two decoupled stages: rasterization of page descriptions, and expansion and printing of page images. The raster image processor (RIP)
									consists of one or more standard DSPs 757 running in parallel. The duplexed print engine controllers consist of custom processors which expand, dither and print page images in real time,
									synchronized with the operation of the printheads in the print engines.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5ab78b" n="0184">Printers not enabled for IR printing have the option to print tags using IR-absorptive black ink, although this restricts tags to otherwise empty areas of the page.
									Although such pages have more limited functionality than IR-printed pages, they are still classed as netpages.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4c7803" n="0185">A normal netpage printer prints netpages on sheets of paper. More specialised netpage printers may print onto more specialised surfaces, such as globes. Each printer
									supports at least one surface type, and supports at least one tag tiling scheme, and hence tag map, for each surface type. The tag map 811 which describes the tag tiling scheme actually used
									to print a document becomes associated with that document so that the document's tags can be correctly interpreted.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_908dcb" n="0186">FIG. 2 shows the netpage printer class diagram, reflecting printer-related information maintained by a registration server 11 on the netpage network.</p>
								<p xml:id="_74433e" n="0187">A preferred embodiment of the netpage printer is described in greater detail in Section 6 below, with reference to FIGS. 11 to 16.</p>
								<p xml:id="_64f05f">1.5.1 Memjet(TM) Printheads</p>
								<p xml:id="_aaa37c" n="0188">The netpage system can operate using printers made with a wide range of digital printing technologies, including thermal inkjet, piezoelectric inkjet, laser
									electrophotographic, and others. However, for wide consumer acceptance, it is desirable that a netpage printer have the following characteristics:
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9c9df3" n="0189">photographic quality color printing</p>
								<p xml:id="_de638c" n="0190">high quality text printing</p>

								<p xml:id="_d52171" n="0198">simultaneous double sided printing</p>
								<p xml:id="_724e3a" n="0199">compact form factor</p>
								<p xml:id="_84b34d" n="0200">low power consumption</p>
								<p xml:id="_3721af" n="0201">No commercially available printing technology has all of these characteristics.</p>
								<p xml:id="_da3a69" n="0202">To enable to production of printers with these characteristics, the present applicant has invented a new print technology, referred to as Memjet(TM) technology.
									Memjet(TM) is a drop-on-demand inkjet technology that incorporates pagewidth printheads fabricated using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. FIG. 17 shows a single printing
									element 300 of a Memjet(TM) printhead. The netpage wallprinter incorporates 168960 printing elements 300 to form a 1600 dpi pagewidth duplex printer. This printer simultaneously prints cyan,
									magenta, yellow, black, and infrared inks as well as paper conditioner and ink fixative.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_dcc13b" n="0203">The printing element 300 is approximately 110 microns long by 32 microns wide. Arrays of these printing elements are formed on a silicon substrate 301 that incorporates
									CMOS logic, data transfer, timing, and drive circuits (not shown).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4edc8c" n="0204">Major elements of the printing element 300 are the nozzle 302, the nozzle rim 303, the nozzle chamber 304, the fluidic seal 305, the ink channel rim 306, the lever arm
									307, the active actuator beam pair 308, the passive actuator beam pair 309, the active actuator anchor 310, the passive actuator anchor 311, and the ink inlet 312.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5bc951" n="0205">The active actuator beam pair 308 is mechanically joined to the passive actuator beam pair 309 at the join 319. Both beams pairs are anchored at their respective anchor
									points 310 and 311. The combination of elements 308, 309, 310, 311, and 319 form a cantilevered electrothermal bend actuator 320.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9cee8e" n="0206">FIG. 18 shows a small part of an array of printing elements 300, including a cross section 315 of a printing element 300. The cross section 315 is shown without ink, to
									clearly show the ink inlet 312 that passes through the silicon wafer 301.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ba5627" n="0207">FIGS. 19(a), 19(b) and 19(c) show the operating cycle of a Memjet(TM) printing element 300.</p>
								<p xml:id="_ac1f17" n="0208">FIG. 19(a) shows the quiescent position of the ink meniscus 316 prior to printing an ink droplet. Ink is retained in the nozzle chamber by surface tension at the ink
									meniscus 316 and at the fluidic seal 305 formed between the nozzle chamber 304 and the ink channel rim 306.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_321381" n="0209">While printing, the printhead CMOS circuitry distributes data from the print engine controller to the correct printing element, latches the data, and buffers the data
									to drive the electrodes 318 of the active actuator beam pair 308. This causes an electrical current to pass through the beam pair 308 for about one microsecond, resulting in Joule heating.
									The temperature increase resulting from Joule heating causes the beam pair 308 to expand. As the passive actuator beam pair 309 is not heated, it does not expand, resulting in a stress
									difference between the two beam pairs. This stress difference is partially resolved by the cantilevered end of the electrothermal bend actuator 320 bending towards the substrate 301. The
									lever arm 307 transmits this movement to the nozzle chamber 304. The nozzle chamber 304 moves about two microns to the position shown in FIG. 19(b). This increases the ink pressure, forcing
									ink 321 out of the nozzle 302, and causing the ink meniscus 316 to bulge. The nozzle rim 303 prevents the ink meniscus 316 from spreading across the surface of the nozzle chamber 304.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_af9781" n="0210">As the temperature of the beam pairs 308 and 309 equalizes, the actuator 320 returns to its original position. This aids in the break-off of the ink droplet 317 from
									the ink 321 in the nozzle chamber, as shown in FIG. 19(c). The nozzle chamber is refilled by the action of the surface tension at the meniscus 316.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e3d44e" n="0211">FIG. 20 shows a segment of a printhead 350. In a netpage printer, the length of the printhead is the full width of the paper (typically 210 mm) in the direction 351.
									The segment shown is 0.4 mm long (about 0.2% of a complete printhead). When printing, the paper is moved past the fixed printhead in the direction 352. The printhead has 6 rows of
									interdigitated printing elements 300, printing the six colors or types of ink supplied by the ink inlets 312.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_36bf38" n="0212">To protect the fragile surface of the printhead during operation, a nozzle guard wafer 330 is attached to the printhead substrate 301. For each nozzle 302 there is a
									corresponding nozzle guard hole 331 through which the ink droplets are fired. To prevent the nozzle guard holes 331 from becoming blocked by paper fibers or other debris, filtered air is
									pumped through the air inlets 332 and out of the nozzle guard holes during printing. To prevent ink 321 from drying, the nozzle guard is sealed while the printer is idle.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a978a3">1.6 The Netpage Pen</p>
								<p xml:id="_684f09" n="0213">The active sensing device of the netpage system is typically a pen 101, which, using its embedded controller 134, is able to capture and decode IR position tags from a
									page via an image sensor. The image sensor is a solid-state device provided with an appropriate filter to permit sensing at only near-infrared wavelengths. As described in more detail below,
									the system is able to sense when the nib is in contact with the surface, and the pen is able to sense tags at a sufficient rate to capture human handwriting (i.e. at 200 dpi or greater and
									100 Hz or faster). Information captured by the pen is encrypted and wirelessly transmitted to the printer (or base station), the printer or base station interpreting the data with respect to
									the (known) page structure.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_58aba1" n="0214">The preferred embodiment of the netpage pen operates both as a normal marking ink pen and as a non-marking stylus. The marking aspect, however, is not necessary for
									using the netpage system as a browsing system, such as when it is used as an Internet interface. Each netpage pen is registered with the netpage system and has a unique pen ID 61. FIG. 23
									shows the netpage pen class diagram, reflecting pen-related information maintained by a registration server 11 on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b37548" n="0215">When either nib is in contact with a netpage, the pen determines its position and orientation relative to the page. The nib is attached to a force sensor, and the force
									on the nib is interpreted relative to a threshold to indicate whether the pen is &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;. This allows a interactive element on the page to be 'clicked' by pressing
									with the pen nib, in order to request, say, information from a network. Furthermore, the force is captured as a continuous value to allow, say, the full dynamics of a signature to be
									verified.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1b87a8" n="0216">The pen determines the position and orientation of its nib on the netpage by imaging, in the infrared spectrum, an area 193of the page in the vicinity of the nib. It
									decodes the nearest tag and computes the position of the nib relative to the tag from the observed perspective distortion on the imaged tag and the known geometry of the pen optics. Although
									the position resolution of the tag may be low, because the tag density on the page is inversely proportional to the tag size, the adjusted position resolution is quite high, exceeding the
									minimum resolution required for accurate handwriting recognition.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef1a67" n="0217">Pen actions relative to a netpage are captured as a series of strokes. A stroke consists of a sequence of time-stamped pen positions on the page, initiated by a
									pen-down event and completed by the subsequent pen-up event. A stroke is also tagged with the page ID 50 of the netpage whenever the page ID changes, which, under normal circumstances, is at
									the commencement of the stroke.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c5550c" n="0218">Each netpage pen has a current selection 826 associated with it, allowing the user to perform copy and paste operations etc. The selection is timestamped to allow the
									system to discard it after a defined time period. The current selection describes a region of a page instance. It consists of the most recent digital ink stroke captured through the pen
									relative to the background area of the page. It is interpreted in an application-specific manner once it is submitted to an application via a selection hyperlink activation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fb5101" n="0219">Each pen has a current nib 824. This is the nib last notified by the pen to the system. In the case of the default netpage pen described above, either the marking black
									ink nib or the non-marking stylus nib is current. Each pen also has a current nib style 825. This is the nib style last associated with the pen by an application, e.g. in response to the user
									selecting a color from a palette. The default nib style is the nib style associated with the current nib. Strokes captured through a pen are tagged with the current nib style. When the
									strokes are subsequently reproduced, they are reproduced in the nib style with which they are tagged.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_idP" n="0220">Whenever the pen is within range of a printer with which it can communicate, the pen slowly flashes its &quot;online&quot; LED. When the pen fails to decode a stroke
									relative to the page, it momentarily activates its &quot;error&quot; LED. When the pen succeeds in decoding a stroke relative to the page, it momentarily activates its &quot;ok&quot; LED.</p>
								<p xml:id="_014257" n="0221">A sequence of captured strokes is referred to as digital ink. Digital ink forms the basis for the digital exchange of drawings and handwriting, for online recognition
									of handwriting, and for online verification of signatures.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0eaf8f" n="0222">The pen is wireless and transmits digital ink to the netpage printer via a short-range radio link. The transmitted digital ink is encrypted for privacy and security and
									packetized for efficient transmission, but is always flushed on a pen-up event to ensure timely handling in the printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_93dd9e" n="0223">When the pen is out-of-range of a printer it buffers digital ink in internal memory, which has a capacity of over ten minutes of continuous handwriting. When the pen is
									once again within range of a printer, it transfers any buffered digital ink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_355431" n="0224">A pen can be registered with any number of printers, but because all state data resides in netpages both on paper and on the network, it is largely immaterial which
									printer a pen is communicating with at any particular time.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_986091" n="0225">A preferred embodiment of the pen is described in greater detail in Section 6 below, with reference to FIGS. 8 to 10.</p>
								<p xml:id="_82b677">1.7 Netpage Interaction</p>
								<p xml:id="_82b094" n="0226">The netpage printer 601 receives data relating to a stroke from the pen 101 when the pen is used to interact with a netpage 1. The coded data 3 of the tags 4 is read by
									the pen when it is used to execute a movement, such as a stroke. The data allows the identity of the particular page and associated interactive element to be determined and an indication of
									the relative positioning of the pen relative to the page to be obtained. The indicating data is transmitted to the printer, where it resolves, via the DNS, the page ID 50 of the stroke into
									the network address of the netpage page server 10 which maintains the corresponding page instance 830. It then transmits the stroke to the page server. If the page was recently identified in
									an earlier stroke, then the printer may already have the address of the relevant page server in its cache. Each netpage consists of a compact page layout maintained persistently by a netpage
									page server (see below). The page layout refers to objects such as images, fonts and pieces of text, typically stored elsewhere on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e508c2" n="0227">When the page server receives the stroke from the pen, it retrieves the page description to which the stroke applies, and determines which element of the page
									description the stroke intersects. It is then able to interpret the stroke in the context of the type of the relevant element.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3537c4" n="0228">A &quot;click&quot; is a stroke where the distance and time between the pen down position and the subsequent pen up position are both less than some small maximum. An
									object which is activated by a click typically requires a click to be activated, and accordingly, a longer stroke is ignored. The failure of a pen action, such as a &quot;sloppy&quot; click,
									to register is indicated by the lack of response from the pen's &quot;ok&quot; LED.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0c0f0e" n="0229">There are two kinds of input elements in a netpage page description: hyperlinks and form fields. Input through a form field can also trigger the activation of an
									associated hyperlink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c22301">1.7.1 Hyperlinks</p>
								<p xml:id="_c2352b" n="0230">A hyperlink is a means of sending a message to a remote application, and typically elicits a printed response in the netpage system.</p>
								<p xml:id="_d9af7e" n="0231">A hyperlink element 844 identifies the application 71 which handles activation of the hyperlink, a link ID 54 which identifies the hyperlink to the application, an
									&quot;alias required&quot; flag which asks the system to include the user's application alias ID 65 in the hyperlink activation, and a description which is used when the hyperlink is recorded
									as a favorite or appears in the user's history. The hyperlink element class diagram is shown in FIG. 29.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_621612" n="0232">When a hyperlink is activated, the page server sends a request to an application somewhere on the network. The application is identified by an application ID 64, and
									the application ID is resolved in the normal way via the DNS. There are three types of hyperlinks: general hyperlinks 863, form hyperlinks 865, and selection hyperlinks 864, as shown in FIG.
									30. A general hyperlink can implement a request for a linked document, or may simply signal a preference to a server. A form hyperlink submits the corresponding form to the application. A
									selection hyperlink submits the current selection to the application. If the current selection contains a single-word piece of text, for example, the application may return a single-page
									document giving the word's meaning within the context in which it appears, or a translation into a different language. Each hyperlink type is characterized by what information is submitted to
									the application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_de6e28" n="0233">The corresponding hyperlink instance 862 records a transaction ID 55 which can be specific to the page instance on which the hyperlink instance appears. The transaction
									ID can identify user-specific data to the application, for example a &quot;shopping cart&quot; of pending purchases maintained by a purchasing application on behalf of the user.</p>
								<p xml:id="_3ad090" n="0234">The system includes the pen's current selection 826 in a selection hyperlink activation. The system includes the content of the associated form instance 868 in a form
									hyperlink activation, although if the hyperlink has its &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute set, only input since the last form submission is included. The system includes an effective return
									path in all hyperlink activations.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_050424" n="0235">A hyperlinked group 866 is a group element 838 which has an associated hyperlink, as shown in FIG. 31. When input occurs through any field element in the group, the
									hyperlink 844 associated with the group is activated. A hyperlinked group can be used to associate hyperlink behavior with a field such as a checkbox. It can also be used, in conjunction with
									the &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute of a form hyperlink, to provide continuous input to an application. It can therefore be used to support a &quot;blackboard&quot; interaction model, i.e.
									where input is captured and therefore shared as soon as it occurs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_444c19">1.7.2 Forms</p>
								<p xml:id="_09c48e" n="0236">A form defines a collection of related input fields used to capture a related set of inputs through a printed netpage. A form allows a user to submit one or more
									parameters to an application software program running on a server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_19d361" n="0237">A form 867 is a group element 838 in the document hierarchy. It ultimately contains a set of terminal field elements 839. A form instance 868 represents a printed
									instance of a form. It consists of a set of field instances 870 which correspond to the field elements 845 of the form. Each field instance has an associated value 871, whose type depends on
									the type of the corresponding field element. Each field value records input through a particular printed form instance, i.e. through one or more printed netpages. The form class diagram is
									shown in FIG. 32.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_220200" n="0238">Each form instance has a status 872 which indicates whether the form is active, frozen, submitted, void or expired. A form is active when first printed. A form becomes
									frozen once it is signed. A form becomes submitted once one of its submission hyperlinks has been activated, unless the hyperlink has its &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute set. A form
									becomes void when the user invokes a void form, reset form or duplicate form page command. A form expires when the time the form has been active exceeds the form's specified lifetime. While
									the form is active, form input is allowed. Input through a form which is not active is instead captured in the background field 833 of the relevant page instance. When the form is active or
									frozen, form submission is allowed. Any attempt to submit a form when the form is not active or frozen is rejected, and instead elicits an form status report.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a1292" n="0239">Each form instance is associated (at 59) with any form instances derived from it, thus providing a version history. This allows all but the latest version of a form in
									a particular time period to be excluded from a search.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d65d72" n="0240">All input is captured as digital ink. Digital ink 873 consists of a set of timestamped stroke groups 874, each of which consists of a set of styled strokes 875. Each
									stroke consists of a set of timestamped pen positions 876, each of which also includes pen orientation and nib force. The digital ink class diagram is shown in FIG. 33.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdee2f" n="0241">A field element 845 can be a checkbox field 877, a text field 878, a drawing field 879, or a signature field 880. The field element class diagram is shown in FIG. 34.
									Any digital ink captured in a field's zone 58 is assigned to the field.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef2dad" n="0242">A checkbox field has an associated boolean value 881, as shown in FIG. 35. Any mark (a tick, a cross, a stroke, a fill zigzag, etc.) captured in a checkbox field's zone
									causes a true value to be assigned to the field's value.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d19e45" n="0243">A text field has an associated text value 882, as shown in FIG. 36. Any digital ink captured in a text field's zone is automatically converted to text via online
									handwriting recognition, and the text is assigned to the field's value. Online handwriting recognition is well-understood (see for example Tappert, C., C. Y. Suen and T. Wakahara, &quot;The
									State of the Art in On-Line Handwriting Recognition&quot;, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 12, No. 8, August 1990).</p>
								<p xml:id="_be4a8f" n="0244">A signature field has an associated digital signature value 883, as shown in FIG. 37. Any digital ink captured in a signature field's zone is automatically verified
									with respect to the identity of the owner of the pen, and a digital signature of the content of the form of which the field is part is generated and assigned to the field's value. The digital
									signature is generated using the pen user's private signature key specific to the application which owns the form. Online signature verification is well-understood (see for example Plamondon,
									R. and G. Lorette, &quot;Automatic Signature Verification and Writer Identification-The State of the Art&quot;, Pattern Recognition, Vol. 22, No. 2, 1989).</p>
								<p xml:id="_d88b12" n="0245">A field element is hidden if its &quot;hidden&quot; attribute is set. A hidden field element does not have an input zone on a page and does not accept input. It can
									have an associated field value which is included in the form data when the form containing the field is submitted.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c4e519" n="0246">&quot;Editing&quot; commands, such as strike-throughs indicating deletion, can also be recognized in form fields.</p>
								<p xml:id="_c6456f" n="0247">Because the handwriting recognition algorithm works &quot;online&quot; (i.e. with access to the dynamics of the pen movement), rather than &quot;offline&quot; (i.e.
									with access only to a bitmap of pen markings), it can recognize run-on discretely-written characters with relatively high accuracy, without a writer-dependent training phase. A
									writer-dependent model of handwriting is automatically generated over time, however, and can be generated up-front if necessary,
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ae0bb7" n="0248">Digital ink, as already stated, consists of a sequence of strokes. Any stroke which starts in a particular element's zone is appended to that element's digital ink
									stream, ready for interpretation. Any stroke not appended to an object's digital ink stream is appended to the background field's digital ink stream.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_62ea2e" n="0249">Digital ink captured in the background field is interpreted as a selection gesture. Circumscription of one or more objects is generally interpreted as a selection of
									the circumscribed objects, although the actual interpretation is application-specific.

								<p xml:id="_461fe9" n="0252">The raw digital ink captured in every field is retained on the netpage page server and is optionally transmitted with the form data when the form is submitted to the
									application. This allows the application to interrogate the raw digital ink should it suspect the original conversion, such as the conversion of handwritten text. This can, for example,
									involve human intervention at the application level for forms which fail certain application-specific consistency checks. As an extension to this, the entire background area of a form can be
									designated as a drawing field. The application can then decide, on the basis of the presence of digital ink outside the explicit fields of the form, to route the form to a human operator, on
									the assumption that the user may have indicated amendments to the filled-in fields outside of those fields.

								<p xml:id="_9850ad" n="0253">FIG. 38 shows a flowchart of the process of handling pen input relative to a netpage. The process consists of receiving (at 884) a stroke from the pen; identifying (at
									885) the page instance 830 to which the page ID 50 in the stroke refers; retrieving (at 886) the page description 5; identifying (at 887) a formatted element 839 whose zone 58 the stroke
									intersects; determining (at 888) whether the formatted element corresponds to a field element, and if so appending (at 892) the received stroke to the digital ink of the field value 871,
									interpreting (at 893) the accumulated digital ink of the field, and determining (at 894) whether the field is part of a hyperlinked group 866 and if so activating (at 895) the associated
									hyperlink; alternatively determining (at 889) whether the formatted element corresponds to a hyperlink element and if so activating (at 895) the corresponding hyperlink; alternatively, in the
									absence of an input field or hyperlink, appending (at 890) the received stroke to the digital ink of the background field 833; and copying (at 891) the received stroke to the current
									selection 826 of the current pen, as maintained by the registration server.

									to the field value; alternatively determining (at 899) whether the field is a text field and if so converting (at 900) the digital ink to computer text, with the help of the appropriate
									registration server, and assigning (at 901) the converted computer text to the field value; alternatively determining (at 902) whether the field is a signature field and if so verifying (at
									903) the digital ink as the signature of the pen's owner, with the help of the appropriate registration server, creating (at 904) a digital signature of the contents of the corresponding
									form, also with the help of the registration server and using the pen owner's private signature key relating to the corresponding application, and assigning (at 905) the digital signature to

								<p xml:id="_eba98a">1.7.3 Page Server Commands</p>
								<p xml:id="_a73a04" n="0255">A page server command is a command which is handled locally by the page server. It operates directly on form, page and document instances.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bc0b68" n="0256">A page server command 907 can be a void form command 908, a duplicate form command 909, a reset form command 910, a get form status command 911, a duplicate page
									command 912, a reset page command 913, a get page status command 914, a duplicate document command 915, a reset document command 916, or a get document status command 917, as shown in FIG.
									39.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_16a8fc" n="0257">A void form command voids the corresponding form instance. A duplicate form command voids the corresponding form instance and then produces an active printed copy of
									the current form instance with field values preserved. The copy contains the same hyperlink transaction IDs as the original, and so is indistinguishable from the original to an application. A
									reset form command voids the corresponding form instance and then produces an active printed copy of the form instance with field values discarded. A get form status command produces a
									printed report on the status of the corresponding form instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the form status of the form instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_59e27a" n="0258">Since a form hyperlink instance contains a transaction ID, the application has to be involved in producing a new form instance. A button requesting a new form instance
									is therefore typically implemented as a hyperlink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7c20e9" n="0259">A duplicate page command produces a printed copy of the corresponding page instance with the background field value preserved. If the page contains a form or is part of
									a form, then the duplicate page command is interpreted as a duplicate form command. A reset page command produces a printed copy of the corresponding page instance with the background field
									value discarded. If the page contains a form or is part of a form, then the reset page command is interpreted as a reset form command. A get page status command produces a printed report on
									the status of the corresponding page instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the status of any forms it contains or is part of.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f4659b" n="0260">The netpage logo which appears on every netpage is usually associated with a duplicate page element.</p>
								<p xml:id="_1d8f0e" n="0261">When a page instance is duplicated with field values preserved, field values are printed in their native form, i.e. a checkmark appears as a standard checkmark graphic,
									and text appears as typeset text. Only drawings and signatures appear in their original form, with a signature accompanied by a standard graphic indicating successful signature verification.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_896c70" n="0262">A duplicate document command produces a printed copy of the corresponding document instance with background field values preserved. If the document contains any forms,
									then the duplicate document command duplicates the forms in the same way a duplicate form command does. A reset document command produces a printed copy of the corresponding document instance
									with background field values discarded. If the document contains any forms, then the reset document command resets the forms in the same way a reset form command does. A get document status
									command produces a printed report on the status of the corresponding document instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the status of any forms
									it contains.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0ebce0" n="0263">If the page server command's &quot;on selected&quot; attribute is set, then the command operates on the page identified by the pen's current selection rather than on
									the page containing the command. This allows a menu of page server commands to be printed. If the target page doesn't contain a page server command element for the designated page server
									command, then the command is ignored.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_66c0d8" n="0264">An application can provide application-specific handling by embedding the relevant page server command element in a hyperlinked group. The page server activates the
									hyperlink associated with the hyperlinked group rather than executing the page server command.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c9cb3f" n="0265">A page server command element is hidden if its &quot;hidden&quot; attribute is set. A hidden command element does not have an input zone on a page and so cannot be
									activated directly by a user. It can, however, be activated via a page server command embedded in a different page, if that page server command has its &quot;on selected&quot; attribute set.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f228a6">1.8 Standard Features of Netpages</p>
								<p xml:id="_cdf0dc" n="0266">In the preferred form, each netpage is printed with the netpage logo at the bottom to indicate that it is a netpage and therefore has interactive properties. The logo
									also acts as a copy button. In most cases pressing the logo produces a copy of the page. In the case of a form, the button produces a copy of the entire form. And in the case of a secure
									document, such as a ticket or coupon, the button elicits an explanatory note or advertising page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1e47cf" n="0267">The default single-page copy function is handled directly by the relevant netpage page server. Special copy functions are handled by linking the logo button to an
									application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9f1c5c">1.9 User Help System</p>
								<p xml:id="_5da2f9" n="0268">In a preferred embodiment, the netpage printer has a single button labelled &quot;Help&quot;. When pressed it elicits a single page of information, including:</p>

								<p xml:id="_0807ff" n="0279">A document function is initiated by simply pressing the button and then touching any page of the document. The status of a document indicates who published it and when,
									to whom it was delivered, and to whom and when it was subsequently submitted as a form.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b44807" n="0280">The netpage network directory allows the user to navigate the hierarchy of publications and services on the network. As an alternative, the user can call the netpage
									network &quot;900&quot; number &quot;yellow pages&quot; and speak to a human operator. The operator can locate the desired document and route it to the user's printer. Depending on the
									document type, the publisher or the user pays the small &quot;yellow pages&quot; service fee.</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a7bad" n="0281">The help page is obviously unavailable if the printer is unable to print. In this case the &quot;error&quot; light is lit and the user can request remote diagnosis over
									the network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d62616">2 Personalized Publication Model</p>
								<p xml:id="_af575a" n="0282">In the following description, news is used as a canonical publication example to illustrate personalization mechanisms in the netpage system. Although news is often
									used in the limited sense of newspaper and newsmagazine news, the intended scope in the present context is wider.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_77e429" n="0283">In the netpage system, the editorial content and the advertising content of a news publication are personalized using different mechanisms. The editorial content is
									personalized according to the reader's explicitly stated and implicitly captured interest profile. The advertising content is personalized according to the reader's locality and demographic.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_654b2a">2.1 Editorial Personalization</p>
								<p xml:id="_fe217d" n="0284">A subscriber can draw on two kinds of news sources: those that deliver news publications, and those that deliver news streams. While news publications are aggregated
									and edited by the publisher, news streams are aggregated either by a news publisher or by a specialized news aggregator. News publications typically correspond to traditional newspapers and
									newsmagazines, while news streams can be many and varied: a &quot;raw&quot; news feed from a news service, a cartoon strip, a freelance writer's column, a friend's bulletin board, or the
									reader's own e-mail.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_630e53" n="0285">The netpage publication server supports the publication of edited news publications as well as the aggregation of multiple news streams. By handling the aggregation and
									hence the formatting of news streams selected directly by the reader, the server is able to place advertising on pages over which it otherwise has no editorial control.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1592d2" n="0286">The subscriber builds a daily newspaper by selecting one or more contributing news publications, and creating a personalized version of each. The resulting daily
									editions are printed and bound together into a single newspaper. The various members of a household typically express their different interests and tastes by selecting different daily
									publications and then customizing them.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aecce0" n="0287">For each publication, the reader optionally selects specific sections. Some sections appear daily, while others appear weekly. The daily sections available from The New
									York Times online, for example, include &quot;Page One Plus&quot;, &quot;National&quot;, &quot;International&quot;, &quot;Opinion&quot;, &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Arts/Living&quot;,
									&quot;Technology&quot;, and &quot;Sports&quot;. The set of available sections is specific to a publication, as is the default subset.</p>
								<p xml:id="_051aca" n="0288">The reader can extend the daily newspaper by creating custom sections, each one drawing on any number of news streams. Custom sections might be created for e-mail and
									friends' announcements (&quot;Personal&quot;), or for monitoring news feeds for specific topics (&quot;Alerts&quot; or &quot;Clippings&quot;).</p>
								<p xml:id="_92c533" n="0289">For each section, the reader optionally specifies its size, either qualitatively (e.g. short, medium, or long), or numerically (i.e. as a limit on its number of pages),
									and the desired proportion of advertising, either qualitatively (e.g. high, normal, low, none), or numerically (i.e. as a percentage).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_becd46" n="0290">The reader also optionally expresses a preference for a large number of shorter articles or a small number of longer articles. Each article is ideally written (or
									edited) in both short and long forms to support this preference.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_14698a" n="0291">An article may also be written (or edited) in different versions to match the expected sophistication of the reader, for example to provide children's and adults'
									versions. The appropriate version is selected according to the reader's age. The reader can specify a &quot;reading age&quot; which takes precedence over their biological age.</p>
								<p xml:id="_98e608" n="0292">The articles which make up each section are selected and prioritized by the editors, and each is assigned a useful lifetime. By default they are delivered to all
									relevant subscribers, in priority order, subject to space constraints in the subscribers' editions.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f5a9f6" n="0293">In sections where it is appropriate, the reader may optionally enable collaborative filtering. This is then applied to articles which have a sufficiently long lifetime.
									Each article which qualifies for collaborative filtering is printed with rating buttons at the end of the article. The buttons can provide an easy choice (e.g. &quot;liked&quot; and
									&quot;disliked&quot;), making it more likely that readers will bother to rate the article.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b171b9" n="0294">Articles with high priorities and short lifetimes are therefore effectively considered essential reading by the editors and are delivered to most relevant subscribers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1bc0ef" n="0295">The reader optionally specifies a serendipity factor, either qualitatively (e.g. do or don't surprise me), or numerically. A high serendipity factor lowers the
									threshold used for matching during collaborative filtering. A high factor makes it more likely that the corresponding section will be filled to the reader's specified capacity. A different
									serendipity factor can be specified for different days of the week.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d4fe85" n="0296">The reader also optionally specifies topics of particular interest within a section, and this modifies the priorities assigned by the editors.</p>
								<p xml:id="_430936" n="0297">The speed of the reader's Internet connection affects the quality at which images can be delivered. The reader optionally specifies a preference for fewer images or
									smaller images or both. If the number or size of images is not reduced, then images may be delivered at lower quality (i.e. at lower resolution or with greater compression).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d65e25" n="0298">At a global level, the reader specifies how quantities, dates, times and monetary values are localized. This involves specifying whether units are imperial or metric, a
									local timezone and time format, and a local currency, and whether the localization consist of in situ translation or annotation. These preferences are derived from the reader's locality by
									default.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fede65" n="0299">To reduce reading difficulties caused by poor eyesight, the reader optionally specifies a global preference for a larger presentation. Both text and images are scaled
									accordingly, and less information is accommodated on each page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a51deb" n="0300">The language in which a news publication is published, and its corresponding text encoding, is a property of the publication and not a preference expressed by the user.
									However, the netpage system can be configured to provide automatic translation services in various guises.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d24b52">2.2 Advertising Localization and Targeting</p>
								<p xml:id="_5448c6" n="0301">The personalization of the editorial content directly affects the advertising content, because advertising is typically placed to exploit the editorial context. Travel
									ads, for example, are more likely to appear in a travel section than elsewhere. The value of the editorial content to an advertiser (and therefore to the publisher) lies in its ability to
									attract large numbers of readers with the right demographics.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ceadcc" n="0302">Effective advertising is placed on the basis of locality and demographics. Locality determines proximity to particular services, retailers etc., and particular
									interests and concerns associated with the local community and environment. Demographics determine general interests and preoccupations as well as likely spending patterns.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f1a62a" n="0303">A news publisher's most profitable product is advertising &quot;space&quot;, a multi-dimensional entity determined by the publication's geographic coverage, the size of
									its readership, its readership demographics, and the page area available for advertising.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3ab7ba" n="0304">In the netpage system, the netpage publication server computes the approximate multi-dimensional size of a publication's saleable advertising space on a per-section
									basis, taking into account the publication's geographic coverage, the section's readership, the size of each reader's section edition, each reader's advertising proportion, and each reader's
									demographic.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_865bf3" n="0305">In comparison with other media, the netpage system allows the advertising space to be defined in greater detail, and allows smaller pieces of it to be sold separately.
									It therefore allows it to be sold at closer to its true value.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f59bb5" n="0306">For example, the same advertising &quot;slot&quot; can be sold in varying proportions to several advertisers, with individual readers' pages randomly receiving the
									advertisement of one advertiser or another, overall preserving the proportion of space sold to each advertiser.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_11b57f" n="0307">The netpage system allows advertising to be linked directly to detailed product information and online purchasing. It therefore raises the intrinsic value of the
									advertising space.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbc07b" n="0308">Because personalization and localization are handled automatically by netpage publication servers, an advertising aggregator can provide arbitrarily broad coverage of
									both geography and demographics. The subsequent disaggregation is efficient because it is automatic. This makes it more cost-effective for publishers to deal with advertising aggregators than
									to directly capture advertising. Even though the advertising aggregator is taking a proportion of advertising revenue, publishers may find the change profit-neutral because of the greater
									efficiency of aggregation. The advertising aggregator acts as an intermediary between advertisers and publishers, and may place the same advertisement in multiple publications.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9ef994" n="0309">It is worth noting that ad placement in a netpage publication can be more complex than ad placement in the publication's traditional counterpart, because the
									publication's advertising space is more complex. While ignoring the full complexities of negotiations between advertisers, advertising aggregators and publishers, the preferred form of the
									netpage system provides some automated support for these negotiations, including support for automated auctions of advertising space. Automation is particularly desirable for the placement of
									advertisements which generate small amounts of income, such as small or highly localized advertisements.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ed91b3" n="0310">Once placement has been negotiated, the aggregator captures and edits the advertisement and records it on a netpage ad server. Correspondingly, the publisher records
									the ad placement on the relevant netpage publication server. When the netpage publication server lays out each user's personalized publication, it picks the relevant advertisements from the
									netpage ad server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_23ae19">2.3 User Profiles</p>
								<p xml:id="_dcf36d">2.3.1 Information Filtering</p>
								<p xml:id="_3a8999" n="0311">The personalization of news and other publications relies on an assortment of user-specific profile information, including:</p>
								<p xml:id="_78c0ea" n="0312">publication customizations</p>
								<p xml:id="_b529c2" n="0313">collaborative filtering vectors</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f5aee" n="0314">contact details</p>
								<p xml:id="_edd7e4" n="0315">presentation preferences</p>
								<p xml:id="_0adfd4" n="0316">The customization of a publication is typically publication-specific, and so the customization information is maintained by the relevant netpage publication server.</p>
								<p xml:id="_fcbd92" n="0317">A collaborative filtering vector consists of the user's ratings of a number of news items. It is used to correlate different users' interests for the purposes of making
									recommendations. Although there are benefits to maintaining a single collaborative filtering vector independently of any particular publication, there are two reasons why it is more practical
									to maintain a separate vector for each publication: there is likely to be more overlap between the vectors of subscribers to the same publication than between those of subscribers to
									different publications; and a publication is likely to want to present its users' collaborative filtering vectors as part of the value of its brand, not to be found elsewhere. Collaborative
									filtering vectors are therefore also maintained by the relevant netpage publication server.
								</p>

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_92e641" n="0323">Each user 800 may be authorized to use any number of printers 802, and each printer may allow any number of users to use it. Each user has a single default printer (at
									66), to which periodical publications are delivered by default, whilst pages printed on demand are delivered to the printer through which the user is interacting. The server keeps track of
									which publishers a user has authorized to print to the user's default printer. A publisher does not record the ID of any particular printer, but instead resolves the ID when it is required.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4c5140" n="0324">When a user subscribes 808 to a publication 807, the publisher 806 (i.e. application provider 803) is authorized to print to a specified printer or the user's default
									printer. This authorization can be revoked at any time by the user. Each user may have several pens 801, but a pen is specific to a single user. If a user is authorized to use a particular

								<p xml:id="_09a75f">2.4 Intelligent Page Layout</p>
								<p xml:id="_76f517" n="0331">The netpage publication server automatically lays out the pages of each user's personalized publication on a section-by-section basis. Since most advertisements are in
									the form of pre-formatted rectangles, they are placed on the page before the editorial content.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0260b6" n="0332">The advertising ratio for a section can be achieved with wildly varying advertising ratios on individual pages within the section, and the ad layout algorithm exploits
									this. The algorithm is configured to attempt to co-locate closely tied editorial and advertising content, such as placing ads for roofing material specifically within the publication because
									of a special feature on do-it-yourself roofing repairs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0017eb" n="0333">The editorial content selected for the user, including text and associated images and graphics, is then laid out according to various aesthetic rules.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a374c1" n="0334">The entire process, including the selection of ads and the selection of editorial content, must be iterated once the layout has converged, to attempt to more closely

								<p xml:id="_fd2c88" n="0336">The primary efficiency mechanism is the separation of information specific to a single user's edition and information shared between multiple users' editions. The
									specific information consists of the page layout. The shared information consists of the objects to which the page layout refers, including images, graphics, and pieces of text.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b9becf" n="0337">A text object contains fully-formatted text represented in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) using the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). XSL provides precise
									control over text formatting independently of the region into which the text is being set, which in this case is being provided by the layout. The text object contains embedded language codes
									to enable automatic translation, and embedded hyphenation hints to aid with paragraph formatting.

								<p xml:id="_9d4aad">2.6 Document Distribution</p>
								<p xml:id="_c99a91" n="0340">As described above, for purposes of efficient distribution and persistent storage on the netpage network, a user-specific page layout is separated from the shared
									objects to which it refers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_756bee" n="0341">When a subscribed publication is ready to be distributed, the netpage publication server allocates, with the help of the netpage ID server 12, a unique ID for each
									page, page instance, document, and document instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bee7a6" n="0342">The server computes a set of optimized subsets of the shared content and creates a multicast channel for each subset, and then tags each user-specific layout with the
									names of the multicast channels which will carry the shared content used by that layout. The server then pointcasts each user's layouts to that user's printer via the appropriate page server,
									and when the pointcasting is complete, multicasts the shared content on the specified channels. After receiving its pointcast, each page server and printer subscribes to the multicast
									channels specified in the page layouts. During the multicasts, each page server and printer extracts from the multicast streams those objects referred to by its page layouts. The page servers
									persistently archive the received page layouts and shared content.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b33be1" n="0343">Once a printer has received all the objects to which its page layouts refer, the printer re-creates the fully-populated layout and then rasterizes and prints it.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0415eb" n="0344">Under normal circumstances, the printer prints pages faster than they can be delivered. Assuming a quarter of each page is covered with images, the average page has a
									size of less than 400 KB. The printer can therefore hold in excess of 100 such pages in its internal 64 MB memory, allowing for temporary buffers etc. The printer prints at a rate of one page
									per second. This is equivalent to 400 KB or about 3 Mbit of page data per second, which is similar to the highest expected rate of page data delivery over a broadband network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f93fa9" n="0345">Even under abnormal circumstances, such as when the printer runs out of paper, it is likely that the user will be able to replenish the paper supply before the
									printer's 100-page internal storage capacity is exhausted.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_41a7a0" n="0346">However, if the printer's internal memory does fill up, then the printer will be unable to make use of a multicast when it first occurs. The netpage publication server
									therefore allows printers to submit requests for re-multicasts. When a critical number of requests is received or a timeout occurs, the server re-multicasts the corresponding shared objects.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_883f94" n="0347">Once a document is printed, a printer can produce an exact duplicate at any time by retrieving its page layouts and contents from the relevant page server.</p>
								<p xml:id="_eb9e70">2.7 On-Demand Documents</p>
								<p xml:id="_df43b3" n="0348">When a netpage document is requested on demand, it can be personalized and delivered in much the same way as a periodical. However, since there is no shared content,
									delivery is made directly to the requesting printer without the use of multicast.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1588c9" n="0349">When a non-netpage document is requested on demand, it is not personalized, and it is delivered via a designated netpage formatting server which reformats it as a
									netpage document. A netpage formatting server is a special instance of a netpage publication server. The netpage formatting server has knowledge of various Internet document formats,
									including Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In the case of HTML, it can make use of the higher resolution of the printed page to present Web pages
									in a multi-column format, with a table of contents. It can automatically include all Web pages directly linked to the requested page. The user can tune this behavior via a preference.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_17dd33" n="0350">The netpage formatting server makes standard netpage behavior, including interactivity and persistence, available on any Internet document, no matter what its origin
									and format. It hides knowledge of different document formats from both the netpage printer and the netpage page server, and hides knowledge of the netpage system from Web servers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_864685">3 Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_6bda41">3.1 Cryptography</p>
								<p xml:id="_955228" n="0351">Cryptography is used to protect sensitive information, both in storage and in transit, and to authenticate parties to a transaction. There are two classes of
									cryptography in widespread use: secret-key cryptography and public-key cryptography. The netpage network uses both classes of cryptography.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_86f37d" n="0352">Secret-key cryptography, also referred to as symmetric cryptography, uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. Two parties wishing to exchange messages must
									first arrange to securely exchange the secret key.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_cd6a32" n="0353">Public-key cryptography, also referred to as asymmetric cryptography, uses two encryption keys. The two keys are mathematically related in such a way that any message
									encrypted using one key can only be decrypted using the other key. One of these keys is then published, while the other is kept private. The public key is used to encrypt any message intended
									for the holder of the private key. Once encrypted using the public key, a message can only be decrypted using the private key. Thus two parties can securely exchange messages without first
									having to exchange a secret key. To ensure that the private key is secure, it is normal for the holder of the private key to generate the key pair.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e2acc3" n="0354">Public-key cryptography can be used to create a digital signature. The holder of the private key can create a known hash of a message and then encrypt the hash using
									the private key. Anyone can then verify that the encrypted hash constitutes the &quot;signature&quot; of the holder of the private key with respect to that particular message by decrypting
									the encrypted hash using the public key and verifying the hash against the message. If the signature is appended to the message, then the recipient of the message can verify both that the
									message is genuine and that it has not been altered in transit.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_12c197" n="0355">To make public-key cryptography work, there has to be a way to distribute public keys which prevents impersonation. This is normally done using certificates and
									certificate authorities. A certificate authority is a trusted third party which authenticates the connection between a public key and someone's identity. The certificate authority verifies
									the person's identity by examining identity documents, and then creates and signs a digital certificate containing the person's identity details and public key. Anyone who trusts the
									certificate authority can use the public key in the certificate with a high degree of certainty that it is genuine. They just have to verify that the certificate has indeed been signed by the
									certificate authority, whose public key is well-known.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_de9df7" n="0356">In most transaction environments, public-key cryptography is only used to create digital signatures and to securely exchange secret session keys. Secret-key
									cryptography is used for all other purposes.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_32fdfa" n="0357">In the following discussion, when reference is made to the secure transmission of information between a netpage printer and a server, what actually happens is that the
									printer obtains the server's certificate, authenticates it with reference to the certificate authority, uses the public key-exchange key in the certificate to exchange a secret session key
									with the server, and then uses the secret session key to encrypt the message data. A session key, by definition, can have an arbitrarily short lifetime.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_828eee">3.2 Netpage Printer Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_00b2d4" n="0358">Each netpage printer is assigned a pair of unique identifiers at time of manufacture which are stored in read-only memory in the printer and in the netpage registration
									server database. The first ID 62 is public and uniquely identifies the printer on the netpage network. The second ID is secret and is used when the printer is first registered on the network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_611ce4" n="0359">When the printer connects to the netpage network for the first time after installation, it creates a signature public/private key pair. It transmits the secret ID and
									the public key securely to the netpage registration server. The server compares the secret ID against the printer's secret ID recorded in its database, and accepts the registration if the IDs
									match. It then creates and signs a certificate containing the printer's public ID and public signature key, and stores the certificate in the registration database.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_00599b" n="0360">The netpage registration server acts as a certificate authority for netpage printers, since it has access to secret information allowing it to verify printer identity.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bb2c91" n="0361">When a user subscribes to a publication, a record is created in the netpage registration server database authorizing the publisher to print the publication to the
									user's default printer or a specified printer. Every document sent to a printer via a page server is addressed to a particular user and is signed by the publisher using the publisher's
									private signature key. The page server verifies, via the registration database, that the publisher is authorized to deliver the publication to the specified user. The page server verifies the
									signature using the publisher's public key, obtained from the publisher's certificate stored in the registration database.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b55ed1" n="0362">The netpage registration server accepts requests to add printing authorizations to the database, so long as those requests are initiated via a pen registered to the
									printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d522d5">3.3 Netpage Pen Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_9df129" n="0363">Each netpage pen is assigned a unique identifier at time of manufacture which is stored in read-only memory in the pen and in the netpage registration server database.
									The pen ID 61 uniquely identifies the pen on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_8618a7" n="0364">A netpage pen can &quot;know&quot; a number of netpage printers, and a printer can &quot;know&quot; a number of pens. A pen communicates with a printer via a radio
									frequency signal whenever it is within range of the printer. Once a pen and printer are registered, they regularly exchange session keys. Whenever the pen transmits digital ink to the
									printer, the digital ink is always encrypted using the appropriate session key. Digital ink is never transmitted in the clear.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_437f13" n="0365">A pen stores a session key for every printer it knows, indexed by printer ID, and a printer stores a session key for every pen it knows, indexed by pen ID. Both have a
									large but finite storage capacity for session keys, and will forget a session key on a least-recently-used basis if necessary.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6ab0ca" n="0366">When a pen comes within range of a printer, the pen and printer discover whether they know each other. If they don't know each other, then the printer determines
									whether it is supposed to know the pen. This might be, for example, because the pen belongs to a user who is registered to use the printer. If the printer is meant to know the pen but
									doesn't, then it initiates the automatic pen registration procedure. If the printer isn't meant to know the pen, then it agrees with the pen to ignore it until the pen is placed in a charging
									cup, at which time it initiates the registration procedure.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ac78cc" n="0367">In addition to its public ID, the pen contains a secret key-exchange key. The key-exchange key is also recorded in the netpage registration server database at time of
									manufacture. During registration, the pen transmits its pen ID to the printer, and the printer transmits the pen ID to the netpage registration server. The server generates a session key for
									the printer and pen to use, and securely transmits the session key to the printer. It also transmits a copy of the session key encrypted with the pen's key-exchange key. The printer stores
									the session key internally, indexed by the pen ID, and transmits the encrypted session key to the pen. The pen stores the session key internally, indexed by the printer ID.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbb1a9" n="0368">Although a fake pen can impersonate a pen in the pen registration protocol, only a real pen can decrypt the session key transmitted by the printer.</p>
								<p xml:id="_00c8c3" n="0369">When a previously unregistered pen is first registered, it is of limited use until it is linked to a user. A registered but &quot;un-owned&quot; pen is only allowed to
									be used to request and fill in netpage user and pen registration forms, to register a new user to which the new pen is automatically linked, or to add a new pen to an existing user.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aded2d" n="0370">The pen uses secret-key rather than public-key encryption because of hardware performance constraints in the pen.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b3884a">3.4 Secure Documents</p>
								<p xml:id="_309d1f" n="0371">The netpage system supports the delivery of secure documents such as tickets and coupons. The netpage printer includes a facility to print watermarks, but will only do
									so on request from publishers who are suitably authorized. The publisher indicates its authority to print watermarks in its certificate, which the printer is able to authenticate.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_42a976" n="0372">The &quot;watermark&quot; printing process uses an alternative dither matrix in specified &quot;watermark&quot; regions of the page. Back-to-back pages contain
									mirror-image watermark regions which coincide when printed. The dither matrices used in odd and even pages' watermark regions are designed to produce an interference effect when the regions
									are viewed together, achieved by looking through the printed sheet.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f77b5" n="0373">The effect is similar to a watermark in that it is not visible when looking at only one side of the page, and is lost when the page is copied by normal means.</p>
								<p xml:id="_751db9" n="0374">Pages of secure documents cannot be copied using the built-in netpage copy mechanism described in Section 1.9 above. This extends to copying netpages on netpage-aware
									photocopiers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aacd95" n="0375">Secure documents are typically generated as part of e-commerce transactions. They can therefore include the user's photograph which was captured when the user
									registered biometric information with the netpage registration server, as described in Section 2.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2babaf" n="0376">When presented with a secure netpage document, the recipient can verify its authenticity by requesting its status in the usual way. The unique ID of a secure document
									is only valid for the lifetime of the document, and secure document IDs are allocated non-contiguously to prevent their prediction by opportunistic forgers. A secure document verification pen
									can be developed with built-in feedback on verification failure, to support easy point-of-presentation document verification.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_781be1" n="0377">Clearly neither the watermark nor the user's photograph are secure in a cryptographic sense. They simply provide a significant obstacle to casual forgery. Online
									document verification, particularly using a verification pen, provides an added level of security where it is needed, but is still not entirely immune to forgeries.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3c755">3.5 Non-Repudiation</p>
								<p xml:id="_9a52f7" n="0378">In the netpage system, forms submitted by users are delivered reliably to forms handlers and are persistently archived on netpage page servers. It is therefore
									impossible for recipients to repudiate delivery.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef4877" n="0379">E-commerce payments made through the system, as described in Section 4, are also impossible for the payee to repudiate.</p>
								<p xml:id="_4547f2">4 Electronic Commerce Model</p>
								<p xml:id="_97497f">4.1 Secure Electronic Transaction (SET)</p>
								<p xml:id="_b57fbd" n="0380">The netpage system uses the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) system as one of its payment systems. SET, having been developed by MasterCard and Visa, is organized
									around payment cards, and this is reflected in the terminology. However, much of the system is independent of the type of accounts being used.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_602f7d" n="0381">In SET, cardholders and merchants register with a certificate authority and are issued with certificates containing their public signature keys. The certificate
									authority verifies a cardholder's registration details with the card issuer as appropriate, and verifies a merchant's registration details with the acquirer as appropriate. Cardholders and
									merchants store their respective private signature keys securely on their computers. During the payment process, these certificates are used to mutually authenticate a merchant and
									cardholder, and to authenticate them both to the payment gateway.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_33f4a2" n="0382">SET has not yet been adopted widely, partly because cardholder maintenance of keys and certificates is considered burdensome. Interim solutions which maintain
									cardholder keys and certificates on a server and give the cardholder access via a password have met with some success.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e63d1b">4.2 Set Payments</p>
								<p xml:id="_d72dd6" n="0383">In the netpage system the netpage registration server acts as a proxy for the netpage user (i.e. the cardholder) in SET payment transactions.</p>
								<p xml:id="_32b39e" n="0384">The netpage system uses biometrics to authenticate the user and authorize SET payments. Because the system is pen-based, the biometric used is the user's on-line
									signature, consisting of time-varying pen position and pressure. A fingerprint biometric can also be used by designing a fingerprint sensor into the pen, although at a higher cost. The type
									of biometric used only affects the capture of the biometric, not the authorization aspects of the system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_da1d61" n="0385">The first step to being able to make SET payments is to register the user's biometric with the netpage registration server. This is done in a controlled environment,
									for example a bank, where the biometric can be captured at the same time as the user's identity is verified. The biometric is captured and stored in the registration database, linked to the
									user's record. The user's photograph is also optionally captured and linked to the record. The SET cardholder registration process is completed, and the resulting private signature key and
									certificate are stored in the database. The user's payment card information is also stored, giving the netpage registration server enough information to act as the user's proxy in any SET
									payment transaction.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a372ac" n="0386">When the user eventually supplies the biometric to complete a payment, for example by signing a netpage order form, the printer securely transmits the order
									information, the pen ID and the biometric data to the netpage registration server. The server verifies the biometric with respect to the user identified by the pen ID, and from then on acts
									as the user's proxy in completing the SET payment transaction.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3e7c95">4.3 Micro-Payments</p>
								<p xml:id="_89891f" n="0387">The netpage system includes a mechanism for micro-payments, to allow the user to be conveniently charged for printing low-cost documents on demand and for copying
									copyright documents, and possibly also to allow the user to be reimbursed for expenses incurred in printing advertising material. The latter depends on the level of subsidy already provided

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_754f91" n="0391">When input occurs through a page which is not user-specific, however, the application must use the user's unique identity to establish a context. A typical example
									involves adding items from a pre-printed catalog page to the user's virtual &quot;shopping cart&quot;. To protect the user's privacy, however, the unique user ID 60 known to the netpage
									system is not divulged to applications. This is to prevent different application providers from easily correlating independently accumulated behavioral data.

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_55776f" n="0407">The application's certificate allows the page server to verify the message signature. The page server's request to the registration server fails if the application ID

									engines 602 and 603, as shown in FIGS. 12 and 12a. It uses a straight paper path with the paper 604 passing through the duplexed print engines 602 and 603 which print both sides of a sheet
									simultaneously, in full color and with full bleed.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b5acfa" n="0462">An integral binding assembly 605 applies a strip of glue along one edge of each printed sheet, allowing it to adhere to the previous sheet when pressed against it. This
									creates a final bound document 618 which can range in thickness from one sheet to several hundred sheets.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_211a84" n="0463">The replaceable ink cartridge 627, shown in FIG. 13 coupled with the duplexed print engines, has bladders or chambers for storing fixative, adhesive, and cyan, magenta,
									yellow, black and infrared inks. The cartridge also contains a micro air filter in a base molding. The micro air filter interfaces with an air pump 638 inside the printer via a hose 639. This
									provides filtered air to the printheads to prevent ingress of micro particles into the Memjet(TM) printheads 350 which might otherwise clog the printhead nozzles. By incorporating the air
									filter within the cartridge, the operational life of the filter is effectively linked to the life of the cartridge. The ink cartridge is a fully recyclable product with a capacity for
									printing and gluing 3000 pages (1500 sheets).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_dd8894" n="0464">Referring to FIG. 12, the motorized media pick-up roller assembly 626 pushes the top sheet directly from the media tray past a paper sensor on the first print engine
									602 into the duplexed Memjet(TM) printhead assembly. The two Memjet(TM) print engines 602 and 603 are mounted in an opposing in-line sequential configuration along the straight paper path.
									The paper 604is drawn into the first print engine 602 by integral, powered pick-up rollers 626. The position and size of the paper 604 is sensed and full bleed printing commences. Fixative is
									printed simultaneously to aid drying in the shortest possible time.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1aba14" n="0465">The paper exits the first Memjet(TM) print engine 602 through a set of powered exit spike wheels (aligned along the straight paper path), which act against a rubberized
									roller. These spike wheels contact the 'wet' printed surface and continue to feed the sheet 604 into the second Memjet(TM) print engine 603.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ee467e" n="0466">Referring to FIGS. 12 and 12a, the paper 604 passes from the duplexed print engines 602 and 603 into the binder assembly 605. The printed page passes between a powered
									spike wheel axle 670 with a fibrous support roller and another movable axle with spike wheels and a momentary action glue wheel. The movable axle/glue assembly 673 is mounted to a metal
									support bracket and it is transported forward to interface with the powered axle 670 via gears by action of a camshaft. A separate motor powers this camshaft.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a0aac0" n="0467">The glue wheel assembly 673 consists of a partially hollow axle 679 with a rotating coupling for the glue supply hose 641 from the ink cartridge 627. This axle 679
									connects to a glue wheel, which absorbs adhesive by capillary action through radial holes. A molded housing 682 surrounds the glue wheel, with an opening at the front. Pivoting side moldings
									and sprung outer doors are attached to the metal bracket and hinge out sideways when the rest of the assembly 673 is thrust forward. This action exposes the glue wheel through the front of
									the molded housing 682. Tension springs close the assembly and effectively cap the glue wheel during periods of inactivity.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_549170" n="0468">As the sheet 604 passes into the glue wheel assembly 673, adhesive is applied to one vertical edge on the front side (apart from the first sheet of a document) as it is
									transported down into the binding assembly 605.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_99fa4e">7.2 Printer Controller Architecture</p>
								<p xml:id="_1d3137" n="0469">The netpage printer controller consists of a controlling processor 750, a factory-installed or field-installed network interface module 625, a radio transceiver
									(transceiver controller 753, baseband circuit 754, RF circuit 755, and RF resonators and inductors 756), dual raster image processor (RIP) DSPs 757, duplexed print engine controllers 760a and
									760b, flash memory 658, and 64 MB of DRAM 657, as illustrated in FIG. 14.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5f3119" n="0470">The controlling processor handles communication with the network 19 and with local wireless netpage pens 101, senses the help button 617, controls the user interface
									LEDs 613-616, and feeds and synchronizes the RIP DSPs 757 and print engine controllers 760. It consists of a medium-performance general-purpose microprocessor. The controlling processor 750
									communicates with the print engine controllers 760 via a high-speed serial bus 659.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_27ecc3" n="0471">The RIP DSPs rasterize and compress page descriptions to the netpage printer's compressed page format. Each print engine controller expands, dithers and prints page
									images to its associated Memjet(TM) printhead 350 in real time (i.e. at over 30 pages per minute). The duplexed print engine controllers print both sides of a sheet simultaneously.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_102bd8" n="0472">The master print engine controller 760a controls the paper transport and monitors ink usage in conjunction with the master QA chip 665 and the ink cartridge QA chip
									761.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_47b692" n="0473">The printer controller's flash memory 658 holds the software for both the processor 750 and the DSPs 757, as well as configuration data. This is copied to main memory
									657 at boot time.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7369b5" n="0474">The processor 750, DSPs 757, and digital transceiver components (transceiver controller 753 and baseband circuit 754) are integrated in a single controller ASIC 656.
									Analog RF components (RF circuit 755 and RF resonators and inductors 756) are provided in a separate RF chip 762. The network interface module 625 is separate, since netpage printers allow
									the network connection to be factory-selected or field-selected. Flash memory 658 and the 2*256 Mbit (64 MB) DRAM 657 is also off-chip. The print engine controllers 760 are provided in
									separate ASICs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b494c0" n="0475">A variety of network interface modules 625 are provided, each providing a netpage network interface 751 and optionally a local computer or network interface 752.
									Netpage network Internet interfaces include POTS modems, Hybrid Fiber-Coax (HFC) cable modems, ISDN modems, DSL modems, satellite transceivers, current and next-generation cellular telephone
									transceivers, and wireless local loop (WLL) transceivers. Local interfaces include IEEE 1284 (parallel port), 10Base-T and 100Base-T Ethernet, USB and USB 2.0, IEEE 1394 (Firewire), and
									various emerging home networking interfaces. If an Internet connection is available on the local network, then the local network interface can be used as the netpage network interface.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7d3149" n="0476">The radio transceiver 753 communicates in the unlicensed 900 MHz band normally used by cordless telephones, or alternatively in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz industrial,
									scientific and medical (ISM) band, and uses frequency hopping and collision detection to provide interference-free communication.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_400e2b" n="0477">The printer controller optionally incorporates an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) interface for receiving data &quot;squirted&quot; from devices such as netpage
									cameras. In an alternative embodiment, the printer uses the IrDA interface for short-range communication with suitably configured netpage pens.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_41ac97">7.2.1 Rasterization and Printing</p>
								<p xml:id="_e28d78" n="0478">Once the main processor 750 has received and verified the document's page layouts and page objects, it runs the appropriate RIP software on the DSPs 757.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0b9ed8" n="0479">The DSPs 757 rasterize each page description and compress the rasterized page image. The main processor stores each compressed page image in memory. The simplest way to
									load-balance multiple DSPs is to let each DSP rasterize a separate page. The DSPs can always be kept busy since an arbitrary number of rasterized pages can, in general, be stored in memory.
									This strategy only leads to potentially poor DSP utilization when rasterizing short documents.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_8741ee" n="0480">Watermark regions in the page description are rasterized to a contone-resolution bi-level bitmap which is losslessly compressed to negligible size and which forms part
									of the compressed page image.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_151583" n="0481">The infrared (IR) layer of the printed page contains coded netpage tags at a density of about six per inch. Each tag encodes the page ID, tag ID, and control bits, and
									the data content of each tag is generated during rasterization and stored in the compressed page image.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_50665c" n="0482">The main processor 750 passes back-to-back page images to the duplexed print engine controllers 760. Each print engine controller 760 stores the compressed page image
									in its local memory, and starts the page expansion and printing pipeline. Page expansion and printing is pipelined because it is impractical to store an entire 114 MB bi-level CMYK+IR page
									image in memory.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4beca4">7.2.2 Print Engine Controller</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a910d" n="0483">The page expansion and printing pipeline of the print engine controller 760 consists of a high speed IEEE 1394 serial interface 659, a standard JPEG decoder 763, a
									standard Group 4 Fax decoder 764, a custom halftoner/compositor unit 765, a custom tag encoder 766, a line loader/formatter unit 767, and a custom interface 768 to the Memjet(TM) printhead
									350.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_92194b" n="0484">The print engine controller 360 operates in a double buffered manner. While one page is loaded into DRAM 769 via the high speed serial interface 659, the previously
									loaded page is read from DRAM 769 and passed through the print engine controller pipeline. Once the page has finished printing, the page just loaded is printed while another page is loaded.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a2a53f" n="0485">The first stage of the pipeline expands (at 763) the JPEG-compressed contone CMYK layer, expands (at 764) the Group 4 Fax-compressed bi-level black layer, and renders
									(at 766) the bi-level netpage tag layer according to the tag format defined in section 1.2, all in parallel. The second stage dithers (at 765) the contone CMYK layer and composites (at 765)
									the bi-level black layer over the resulting bi-level CMYK layer. The resultant bi-level CMYK+IR dot data is buffered and formatted (at 767) for printing on the Memjet(TM) printhead 350 via a
									set of line buffers. Most of these line buffers are stored in the off-chip DRAM. The final stage prints the six channels of bi-level dot data (including fixative) to the Memjet(TM) printhead
									350 via the printhead interface 768.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_147f8e" n="0486">When several print engine controllers 760 are used in unison, such as in a duplexed configuration, they are synchronized via a shared line sync signal 770. Only one
									print engine 760, selected via the external master/slave pin 771, generates the line sync signal 770 onto the shared line.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_65d171" n="0487">The print engine controller 760 contains a low-speed processor 772 for synchronizing the page expansion and rendering pipeline, configuring the printhead 350 via a
									low-speed serial bus 773, and controlling the stepper motors 675, 676.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_06eadc" n="0488">In the 8[1/2]'' versions of the netpage printer, the two print engines each prints 30 Letter pages per minute along the long dimension of the page (11''), giving a line
									rate of 8.8 kHz at 1600 dpi. In the 12'' versions of the netpage printer, the two print engines each prints 45 Letter pages per minute along the short dimension of the page (8[1/2]''), giving
									a line rate of 10.2 kHz. These line rates are well within the operating frequency of the Memjet(TM) printhead, which in the current design exceeds 30 kHz.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1de07c">8 Netpage Greeting Cards</p>
								<p xml:id="_b5e28e" n="0489">The netpage system provides an application whereby a user can create a customised greeting card by selecting an image and a greeting message, and adding a handwritten
									message. The card can be sent to the recipient either directly to their default netpage printer, or to their postal address.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_29565f" n="0490">A user can select a greeting card from an on-line catalogue, add a handwritten message, and dispatch it via the netpage network. Cards can be addressed to other netpage
									users, and to normal postal addresses. In the latter case the card is printed at the service centre closest to the recipient, automatically placed in an envelope, and mailed through the local
									mail system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bae99f" n="0491">Netpage users can choose to receive cards from anyone, or only from authorised friends.</p>
								<p xml:id="_ee165f">8.1 Application Diagram Notation</p>
								<p xml:id="_6ad290" n="0492">Each application user interface flow is illustrated as a collection of documents linked by command arrows. A command arrow indicates that the target document is printed
									as a result of the user pressing the corresponding command button on the source page. Some command arrows are labelled with multiple commands separated by slashes ('/'s), indicating that any
									one of the specified commands causes the target document to be printed. Although multiple commands may label the same command arrow, they typically have different side-effects.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdbea7" n="0493">In application terms, it is important to distinguish between netpage documents and netpage forms. Documents contain printed information, as well as command buttons
									which can be pressed by the user to request further information or some other action. Forms, in addition to behaving like normal documents, also contain input fields which can be filled in by
									the user. They provide the system with a data input mechanism. It is also useful to distinguish between documents which contain generic information and documents which contain information
									specific to a particular interaction between the user and an application. Generic documents may be pre-printed publications such as magazines sold at news stands or advertising posters
									encountered in public places. Forms may also be pre-printed, including, for example, subscription forms encountered in pre-printed publications. They may, of course, also be generated
									on-the-fly by a netpage printer in response to user requests. User-specific documents and forms are normally generated on the fly by a netpage printer in response to user requests. FIG. 48
									shows a generic document 990, a generic form 991, a user-specific document 992, and a user-specific form 993.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e403d1" n="0494">Netpages which participate in a user interface flow are further described by abstract page layouts. A page layout may contain various kinds of elements, each of which
									has a unique style to differentiate it from the others. As shown in FIG. 49, these include fixed information 994, variable information 995, input fields 996, command buttons 997, and
									draggable commands 998.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f986c3" n="0495">When a user interface flow is broken up into multiple diagrams, any document which is duplicated is shown with dashed outlines in all but the main diagram which defines
									it.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2ea954">8.2 Greeting Cards Object Model</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a790c" n="0496">The greeting cards object model revolves around a greeting card supplier, customers and customised greeting cards. The Greeting Cards class diagram 500 is shown in FIG.
									50.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_47a122" n="0497">Each supplier 501 has a unique identifier and a name 501a. Each customer 502 is related to a particular supplier, and has an identifier 503 which is unique within the
									scope of the particular supplier.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_39f47a" n="0498">Each customer 502 represents a particular netpage user 800 to the supplier. A netpage user, on the other hand, can be the customer of any number of suppliers.</p>
								<p xml:id="_10aaf6" n="0499">The name and description of a customer 502 derive by default from the details of the corresponding netpage user 800.</p>
								<p xml:id="_abf375" n="0500">Each supplier 501 has a number of categories 505 of greeting cards. Each category has a number of card images 525 and a number of card messages 507.</p>
								<p xml:id="_110df7" n="0501">A customer 502 can create a customised card 508. Each customised card has a unique identifier 509, the date and time the card was created, the custom message
									handwritten by the user (stored as digital ink), and a fee. Each customised card has a recipient 510. If the recipient is another netpage user, the card is delivered directly to their default
									netpage printer. If the recipient is not a netpage user, the customer specifies the name and postal address for delivery of the card. The Card Recipient class diagram 511 is shown in FIG. 52.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5964bc" n="0502">Each customer 502 has an account 512 with the supplier 501, with a running balance 513. Account payments 547 are associated directly with the customer account. The
									payments class diagram 514 is shown in FIG. 51. Each customer has a history of payment methods 515 with the supplier. The set of payment methods 516 to 519 supported by a particular supplier
									will be specific to that supplier, and may be different for different customers depending on their credit ratings etc.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b3353c" n="0503">When the netpage account payment method 516 is used, the user's netpage account 820 is debited, and the transaction appears on the user's netpage account statement.</p>
								<p xml:id="_74259f" n="0504">When the customer account payment method 517 is used, the user is invoiced for payment.</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3216e" n="0505">When the SET payment method 519 is used, the corresponding SET payment card 821 linked to the user is used to make payment according to the normal SET protocol.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a9c087" n="0506">When the payment card payment method 518 is used, the specified payment card is used to make payment according to the normal protocol between the provider and their
									acquiring bank or institution which handles the particular payment card type.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0e0291" n="0507">Each payment has a unique payment number, the date and time of the payment, the amount paid, and a receipt number.</p>
								<p xml:id="_9dfc53" n="0508">Netpage users may receive cards from anyone, or only from authorized friends, depending on their netpage e-mail settings. If the user's e-mail privacy setting is such
									that e-mails may only be received from members of their contact list, then greeting cards may also only be received from members of the same contact list.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4b1bb7">8.3 Greeting Cards User Interface</p>
								<p xml:id="_4d1694" n="0509">The user may obtain the Netpage Greeting Cards main page 522 from a variety of links including:</p>

								<p xml:id="_65348a">BACKGROUND</p>
								<p xml:id="_77bf76" n="0006">Paper is widely used to display and record information. Printed information is easier to read than information displayed on a computer screen. Hand-drawing and
									handwriting afford greater richness of expression than input via a computer keyboard and mouse. Moreover, paper doesn't run on batteries, can be read in bright light, more robustly accepts
									coffee spills, and is portable and disposable.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_968fa0" n="0007">Online publication has many advantages over traditional paper-based publication. From a consumer's point of view, information is available on demand, information can be
									navigated via hypertext links, searched and automatically personalized.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0ac795" n="0008">From the publisher's point of view, the costs of printing and physical distribution are eliminated, and the publication becomes more attractive to the advertisers who
									pay for it because it can be targeted to specific demographics and linked to product sites.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d9c9ce" n="0009">Online publication also has disadvantages. Computer screens are inferior to paper. At the same quality as a magazine page, an SVGA computer screen displays only about a
									fifth as much information. Both CRTs and LCDs have brightness and contrast problems, particularly when ambient light is strong, while ink on paper, being reflective rather than emissive, is
									both bright and sharp in ambient light.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_efcfd8">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</p>
								<p xml:id="_bbe9b1" n="0010">In accordance with the invention, there is provided a method of selecting and delivering a greeting card, including:</p>
								<p xml:id="_044878" n="0011">providing a document with details of a selection of available greeting cards, the document having at least one user-interactive element with which a user interacts to
									select a card using a sensing device adapted to transmit interaction data to a computer system;

								<p xml:id="_d2da74">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED AND OTHER EMBODIMENTS</p>
								<p xml:id="_1a08b0" n="0102">Note: Memjet(TM) is a trade mark of Silverbrook Research Pty Ltd, Australia.</p>
								<p xml:id="_15a829" n="0103">In the preferred embodiment, the invention is configured to work with the netpage networked computer system, a detailed overview of which follows. It will be
									appreciated that not every implementation will necessarily embody all or even most of the specific details and extensions discussed below in relation to the basic system. However, the system
									is described in its most complete form to reduce the need for external reference when attempting to understand the context in which the preferred embodiments and aspects of the present
									invention operate.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d7b593" n="0104">In brief summary, the preferred form of the netpage system employs a computer interface in the form of a mapped surface, that is, a physical surface which contains
									references to a map of the surface maintained in a computer system. The map references can be queried by an appropriate sensing device. Depending upon the specific implementation, the map
									references may be encoded visibly or invisibly, and defined in such a way that a local query on the mapped surface yields an unambiguous map reference both within the map and among different
									maps. The computer system can contain information about features on the mapped surface, and such information can be retrieved based on map references supplied by a sensing device used with
									the mapped surface. The information thus retrieved can take the form of actions which are initiated by the computer system on behalf of the operator in response to the operator's interaction
									with the surface features.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1709a2" n="0105">In its preferred form, the netpage system relies on the production of, and human interaction with, netpages. These are pages of text, graphics and images printed on
									ordinary paper, but which work like interactive web pages. Information is encoded on each page using ink which is substantially invisible to the unaided human eye. The ink, however, and
									thereby the coded data, can be sensed by an optically imaging pen and transmitted to the netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f8217" n="0106">In the preferred form, active buttons and hyperlinks on each page can be clicked with the pen to request information from the network or to signal preferences to a
									network server. In one embodiment, text written by hand on a netpage is automatically recognized and converted to computer text in the netpage system, allowing forms to be filled in. In other
									embodiments, signatures recorded on a netpage are automatically verified, allowing e-commerce transactions to be securely authorized.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0c3540" n="0107">As illustrated in FIG. 1, a printed netpage 1 can represent a interactive form which can be filled in by the user both physically, on the printed page, and
									&quot;electronically&quot;, via communication between the pen and the netpage system. The example shows a &quot;Request&quot; form containing name and address fields and a submit button. The
									netpage consists of graphic data 2 printed using visible ink, and coded data 3 printed as a collection of tags 4 using invisible ink. The corresponding page description 5, stored on the
									netpage network, describes the individual elements of the netpage. In particular it describes the type and spatial extent (zone) of each interactive element (i.e. text field or button in the
									example), to allow the netpage system to correctly interpret input via the netpage. The submit button 6, for example, has a zone 7 which corresponds to the spatial extent of the corresponding
									graphic 8.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4b690e" n="0108">As illustrated in FIG. 2, the netpage pen 101, a preferred form of which is shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 and described in more detail below, works in conjunction with a
									netpage printer 601, an Internet-connected printing appliance for home, office or mobile use. The pen is wireless and communicates securely with the netpage printer via a short-range radio
									link 9.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7d3801" n="0109">The netpage printer 601, a preferred form of which is shown in FIGS. 11 to 13 and described in more detail below, is able to deliver, periodically or on demand,
									personalized newspapers, magazines, catalogs, greeting cards and other publications, all printed at high quality as interactive netpages. Unlike a personal computer, the netpage printer is an
									appliance which can be, for example, wall-mounted adjacent to an area where the morning news is first consumed, such as in a user's kitchen, near a breakfast table, or near the household's
									point of departure for the day. It also comes in tabletop, desktop, portable and miniature versions.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_62a805" n="0110">Netpages printed at their point of consumption combine the ease-of-use of paper with the timeliness and interactivity of an interactive medium.</p>
								<p xml:id="_44d96c" n="0111">As shown in FIG. 2, the netpage pen 101 interacts with the coded data on a printed netpage 1 and communicates, via a short-range radio link 9, the interaction to a
									netpage printer. The printer 601 sends the interaction to the relevant netpage page server 10 for interpretation. In appropriate circumstances, the page server sends a corresponding message
									to application computer software running on a netpage application server 13. The application server may in turn send a response which is printed on the originating printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d68ffb" n="0112">The netpage system is made considerably more convenient in the preferred embodiment by being used in conjunction with high-speed microelectromechanical system (MEMS)
									based inkjet (Memjet(TM)) printers. In the preferred form of this technology, relatively high-speed and high-quality printing is made more affordable to consumers. In its preferred form, a
									netpage publication has the physical characteristics of a traditional newsmagazine, such as a set of letter-size glossy pages printed in full color on both sides, bound together for easy
									navigation and comfortable handling.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7574e0" n="0113">The netpage printer exploits the growing availability of broadband Internet access. Cable service is available to 95% of households in the United States, and cable
									modem service offering broadband Internet access is already available to 20% of these. The netpage printer can also operate with slower connections, but with longer delivery times and lower
									image quality. Indeed, the netpage system can be enabled using existing consumer inkjet and laser printers, although the system will operate more slowly and will therefore be less acceptable
									from a consumer's point of view. In other embodiments, the netpage system is hosted on a private intranet. In still other embodiments, the netpage system is hosted on a single computer or
									computer-enabled device, such as a printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbdc6f" n="0114">Netpage publication servers 14 on the netpage network are configured to deliver print-quality publications to netpage printers. Periodical publications are delivered
									automatically to subscribing netpage printers via pointcasting and multicasting Internet protocols. Personalized publications are filtered and formatted according to individual user profiles.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c1de77" n="0115">A netpage printer can be configured to support any number of pens, and a pen can work with any number of netpage printers. In the preferred implementation, each netpage
									pen has a unique identifier. A household may have a collection of colored netpage pens, one assigned to each member of the family. This allows each user to maintain a distinct profile with
									respect to a netpage publication server or application server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_478f3f" n="0116">A netpage pen can also be registered with a netpage registration server 11 and linked to one or more payment card accounts. This allows e-commerce payments to be
									securely authorized using the netpage pen. The netpage registration server compares the signature captured by the netpage pen with a previously registered signature, allowing it to
									authenticate the user's identity to an e-commerce server. Other biometrics can also be used to verify identity. A version of the netpage pen includes fingerprint scanning, verified in a
									similar way by the netpage registration server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4617cb" n="0117">Although a netpage printer may deliver periodicals such as the morning newspaper without user intervention, it can be configured never to deliver unsolicited junk mail.
									In its preferred form, it only delivers periodicals from subscribed or otherwise authorized sources. In this respect, the netpage printer is unlike a fax machine or e-mail account which is
									visible to any junk mailer who knows the telephone number or email address.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_75e850">1 Netpage System Architecture</p>
								<p xml:id="_d269d9" n="0118">Each object model in the system is described using a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram. A class diagram consists of a set of object classes connected by
									relationships, and two kinds of relationships are of interest here: associations and generalizations. An association represents some kind of relationship between objects, i.e. between
									instances of classes. A generalization relates actual classes, and can be understood in the following way: if a class is thought of as the set of all objects of that class, and class A is a
									generalization of class B, then B is simply a subset of A. The UML does not directly support second-order modelling-i.e. classes of classes.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fcc8c4" n="0119">Each class is drawn as a rectangle labelled with the name of the class. It contains a list of the attributes of the class, separated from the name by a horizontal line,
									and a list of the operations of the class, separated from the attribute list by a horizontal line. In the class diagrams which follow, however, operations are never modelled.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_930450" n="0120">An association is drawn as a line joining two classes, optionally labelled at either end with the multiplicity of the association. The default multiplicity is one. An
									asterisk (*) indicates a multiplicity of &quot;many&quot;, i.e. zero or more. Each association is optionally labelled with its name, and is also optionally labelled at either end with the
									role of the corresponding class. An open diamond indicates an aggregation association (&quot;is-part-of&quot;), and is drawn at the aggregator end of the association line.</p>
								<p xml:id="_65d51d" n="0121">A generalization relationship (&quot;is-a&quot;) is drawn as a solid line joining two classes, with an arrow (in the form of an open triangle) at the generalization
									end.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9a7424" n="0122">When a class diagram is broken up into multiple diagrams, any class which is duplicated is shown with a dashed outline in all but the main diagram which defines it. It
									is shown with attributes only where it is defined.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a08e0">1.1 Netpages</p>
								<p xml:id="_81174a" n="0123">Netpages are the foundation on which a netpage network is built. They provide a paper-based user interface to published information and interactive services.</p>
								<p xml:id="_94b170" n="0124">A netpage consists of a printed page (or other surface region) invisibly tagged with references to an online description of the page. The online page description is
									maintained persistently by a netpage page server. The page description describes the visible layout and content of the page, including text, graphics and images. It also describes the input
									elements on the page, including buttons, hyperlinks, and input fields. A netpage allows markings made with a netpage pen on its surface to be simultaneously captured and processed by the
									netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b6bc7b" n="0125">Multiple netpages can share the same page description. However, to allow input through otherwise identical pages to be distinguished, each netpage is assigned a unique
									page identifier. This page ID has sufficient precision to distinguish between a very large number of netpages.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5634bd" n="0126">Each reference to the page description is encoded in a printed tag. The tag identifies the unique page on which it appears, and thereby indirectly identifies the page
									description. The tag also identifies its own position on the page. Characteristics of the tags are described in more detail below.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_8caa37" n="0127">Tags are printed in infrared-absorptive ink on any substrate which is infrared-reflective, such as ordinary paper. Near-infrared wavelengths are invisible to the human
									eye but are easily sensed by a solid-state image sensor with an appropriate filter.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_27362c" n="0128">A tag is sensed by an area image sensor in the netpage pen, and the tag data is transmitted to the netpage system via the nearest netpage printer. The pen is wireless
									and communicates with the netpage printer via a short-range radio link. Tags are sufficiently small and densely arranged that the pen can reliably image at least one tag even on a single
									click on the page. It is important that the pen recognize the page ID and position on every interaction with the page, since the interaction is stateless. Tags are error-correctably encoded
									to make them partially tolerant to surface damage.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_972a8e" n="0129">The netpage page server maintains a unique page instance for each printed netpage, allowing it to maintain a distinct set of user-supplied values for input fields in
									the page description for each printed netpage.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c68ff4" n="0130">The relationship between the page description, the page instance, and the printed netpage is shown in FIG. 4. The page instance is associated with both the netpage
									printer which printed it and, if known, the netpage user who requested it.

								<p xml:id="_fbf070">1.2.1 Tag Data Content</p>
								<p xml:id="_a44ff8" n="0131">In a preferred form, each tag identifies the region in which it appears, and the location of that tag within the region. A tag may also contain flags which relate to
									the region as a whole or to the tag. One or more flag bits may, for example, signal a tag sensing device to provide feedback indicative of a function associated with the immediate area of the
									tag, without the sensing device having to refer to a description of the region. A netpage pen may, for example, illuminate an &quot;active area&quot; LED when in the zone of a hyperlink.</p>
								<p xml:id="_25fa3a" n="0132">As will be more clearly explained below, in a preferred embodiment, each tag contains an easily recognized invariant structure which aids initial detection, and which
									assists in minimizing the effect of any warp induced by the surface or by the sensing process. The tags preferably tile the entire page, and are sufficiently small and densely arranged that
									the pen can reliably image at least one tag even on a single click on the page. It is important that the pen recognize the page ID and position on every interaction with the page, since the
									interaction is stateless.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c5c2c2" n="0133">
									In a preferred embodiment, the region to which a tag refers coincides with an entire page, and the region ID encoded in the tag is therefore synonomous with the page ID of the page on which
									the tag appears. In other embodiments, the region to which a tag refers can be an arbitrary subregion of a page or other surface. For example, it can coincide with the zone of an interactive
									element, in which case the region ID can directly identify the interactive element.

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_976706" n="0134">Each tag contains 120 bits of information, typically allocated as shown in Table 1. Assuming a maximum tag density of 64 per square inch, a 16-bit tag ID supports a
									region size of up to 1024 square inches. Larger regions can be mapped continuously without increasing the tag ID precision simply by using abutting regions and maps. The 100-bit region ID
									allows 2&lt;100 &gt; (10&lt;30 &gt; or a million trillion trillion) different regions to be uniquely identified.</p>
								<p xml:id="_2600b9">1.2.2 Tag Data Encoding</p>
								<p xml:id="_e12e82" n="0135">The 120 bits of tag data are redundantly encoded using a (15, 5) Reed-Solomon code. This yields 360 encoded bits consisting of 6 codewords of 15 4-bit symbols each. The
									(15, 5) code allows up to 5 symbol errors to be corrected per codeword, i.e. it is tolerant of a symbol error rate of up to 33% per codeword.</p>
								<p xml:id="_f58fe6" n="0136">Each 4-bit symbol is represented in a spatially coherent way in the tag, and the symbols of the six codewords are interleaved spatially within the tag. This ensures
									that a burst error (an error affecting multiple spatially adjacent bits) damages a minimum number of symbols overall and a minimum number of symbols in any one codeword, thus maximising the
									likelihood that the burst error can be fully corrected.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d28cd0">1.2.3 Physical Tag Structure</p>
								<p xml:id="_f3859a" n="0137">The physical representation of the tag, shown in FIG. 5, includes fixed target structures 15, 16, 17 and variable data areas 18. The fixed target structures allow a
									sensing device such as the netpage pen to detect the tag and infer its three-dimensional orientation relative to the sensor. The data areas contain representations of the individual bits of
									the encoded tag data.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f78258" n="0138">To achieve proper tag reproduction, the tag is rendered at a resolution of 256*256 dots. When printed at 1600 dots per inch this yields a tag with a diameter of about 4
									mm. At this resolution the tag is designed to be surrounded by a &quot;quiet area&quot; of radius 16 dots. Since the quiet area is also contributed by adjacent tags, it only adds 16 dots to
									the effective diameter of the tag.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3530a4" n="0139">The tag includes six target structures. A detection ring 15 allows the sensing device to initially detect the tag. The ring is easy to detect because it is rotationally
									invariant and because a simple correction of its aspect ratio removes most of the effects of perspective distortion. An orientation axis 16 allows the sensing device to determine the
									approximate planar orientation of the tag due to the yaw of the sensor. The orientation axis is skewed to yield a unique orientation. Four perspective targets 17 allow the sensing device to
									infer an accurate two-dimensional perspective transform of the tag and hence an accurate three-dimensional position and orientation of the tag relative to the sensor.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_42fc4f" n="0140">All target structures are redundantly large to improve their immunity to noise.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0f502a" n="0141">The overall tag shape is circular. This supports, amongst other things, optimal tag packing on an irregular triangular grid. In combination with the circular detection
									ring, this makes a circular arrangement of data bits within the tag optimal. To maximise its size, each data bit is represented by a radial wedge in the form of an area bounded by two radial
									lines and two concentric circular arcs. Each wedge has a minimum dimension of 8 dots at 1600 dpi and is designed so that its base (its inner arc), is at least equal to this minimum dimension.
									The height of the wedge in the radial direction is always equal to the minimum dimension. Each 4-bit data symbol is represented by an array of 2*2 wedges.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_48ab70" n="0142">The 15 4-bit data symbols of each of the six codewords are allocated to the four concentric symbol rings 18a to 18d in interleaved fashion. Symbols are allocated
									alternately in circular progression around the tag.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3eaec5" n="0143">The interleaving is designed to maximise the average spatial distance between any two symbols of the same codeword.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a4e322" n="0144">In order to support &quot;single-click&quot; interaction with a tagged region via a sensing device, the sensing device must be able to see at least one entire tag in
									its field of view no matter where in the region or at what orientation it is positioned. The required diameter of the field of view of the sensing device is therefore a function of the size
									and spacing of the tags.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a1f9a0" n="0145">Assuming a circular tag shape, the minimum diameter of the sensor field of view is obtained when the tags are tiled on a equilateral triangular grid, as shown in FIG.
									6.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6cfff7">1.2.5 Tag Image Processing and Decoding</p>
								<p xml:id="_e64847" n="0146">The tag image processing and decoding performed by a sensing device such as the netpage pen is shown in FIG. 7. While a captured image is being acquired from the image
									sensor, the dynamic range of the image is determined (at 20). The center of the range is then chosen as the binary threshold for the image 21. The image is then thresholded and segmented into
									connected pixel regions (i.e. shapes 23) (at 22). Shapes which are too small to represent tag target structures are discarded. The size and centroid of each shape is also computed.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_52f6a9" n="0147">Binary shape moments 25 are then computed (at 24) for each shape, and these provide the basis for subsequently locating target structures. Central shape moments are by
									their nature invariant of position, and can be easily made invariant of scale, aspect ratio and rotation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1f4c58" n="0148">The ring target structure 15 is the first to be located (at 26). A ring has the advantage of being very well behaved when perspective-distorted. Matching proceeds by
									aspect-normalizing and rotation-normalizing each shape's moments. Once its second-order moments are normalized the ring is easy to recognize even if the perspective distortion was
									significant. The ring's original aspect and rotation 27 together provide a useful approximation of the perspective transform.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_91d2ca" n="0149">The axis target structure 16 is the next to be located (at 28). Matching proceeds by applying the ring's normalizations to each shape's moments, and
									rotation-normalizing the resulting moments. Once its second-order moments are normalized the axis target is easily recognized. Note that one third order moment is required to disambiguate the
									two possible orientations of the axis. The shape is deliberately skewed to one side to make this possible. Note also that it is only possible to rotation-normalize the axis target after it
									has had the ring's normalizations applied, since the perspective distortion can hide the axis target's axis. The axis target's original rotation provides a useful approximation of the tag's
									rotation due to pen yaw 29.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b02ffc" n="0150">The four perspective target structures 17 are the last to be located (at 30). Good estimates of their positions are computed based on their known spatial relationships
									to the ring and axis targets, the aspect and rotation of the ring, and the rotation of the axis. Matching proceeds by applying the ring's normalizations to each shape's moments. Once their
									second-order moments are normalized the circular perspective targets are easy to recognize, and the target closest to each estimated position is taken as a match. The original centroids of
									the four perspective targets are then taken to be the perspective-distorted corners 31 of a square of known size in tag space, and an eight-degree-of-freedom perspective transform 33 is
									inferred (at 32) based on solving the well-understood equations relating the four tag-space and image-space point pairs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a57fb8" n="0151">The inferred tag-space to image-space perspective transform is used to project (at 36) each known data bit position in tag space into image space where the real-valued
									position is used to bilinearly interpolate (at 36) the four relevant adjacent pixels in the input image. The previously computed image threshold 21 is used to threshold the result to produce
									the final bit value 37.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_94ece3" n="0152">Once all 360 data bits 37 have been obtained in this way, each of the six 60-bit Reed-Solomon codewords is decoded (at 38) to yield 20 decoded bits 39, or 120 decoded
									bits in total. Note that the codeword symbols are sampled in codeword order, so that codewords are implicitly de-interleaved during the sampling process.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7b4194" n="0153">The ring target 15 is only sought in a subarea of the image whose relationship to the image guarantees that the ring, if found, is part of a complete tag. If a complete
									tag is not found and successfully decoded, then no pen position is recorded for the current frame. Given adequate processing power and ideally a non-minimal field of view 193, an alternative
									strategy involves seeking another tag in the current image.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7c1be3" n="0154">The obtained tag data indicates the identity of the region containing the tag and the position of the tag within the region. An accurate position 35 of the pen nib in
									the region, as well as the overall orientation 35 of the pen, is then inferred (at 34) from the perspective transform 33 observed on the tag and the known spatial relationship between the
									pen's physical axis and the pen's optical axis.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d3d0f6">1.2.6 Tag Map</p>
								<p xml:id="_b62d2b" n="0155">Decoding a tag results in a region ID, a tag ID, and a tag-relative pen transform. Before the tag ID and the tag-relative pen location can be translated into an
									absolute location within the tagged region, the location of the tag within the region must be known. This is given by a tag map, a function which maps each tag ID in a tagged region to a
									corresponding location. The tag map class diagram is shown in FIG. 22, as part of the netpage printer class diagram.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a93dcc" n="0156">A tag map reflects the scheme used to tile the surface region with tags, and this can vary according to surface type. When multiple tagged regions share the same tiling
									scheme and the same tag numbering scheme, they can also share the same tag map.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_98e76d" n="0157">The tag map for a region must be retrievable via the region ID. Thus, given a region ID, a tag ID and a pen transform, the tag map can be retrieved, the tag ID can be
									translated into an absolute tag location within the region, and the tag-relative pen location can be added to the tag location to yield an absolute pen location within the region.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d3a358">1.2.7 Tagging Schemes</p>
								<p xml:id="_fdf6d4" n="0158">Two distinct surface coding schemes are of interest, both of which use the tag structure described earlier in this section. The preferred coding scheme uses
									&quot;location-indicating&quot; tags as already discussed. An alternative coding scheme uses object-indicating tags.</p>
								<p xml:id="_51a5ad" n="0159">A location-indicating tag contains a tag ID which, when translated through the tag map associated with the tagged region, yields a unique tag location within the
									region. The tag-relative location of the pen is added to this tag location to yield the location of the pen within the region. This in turn is used to determine the location of the pen
									relative to a user interface element in the page description associated with the region. Not only is the user interface element itself identified, but a location relative to the user
									interface element is identified. Location-indicating tags therefore trivially support the capture of an absolute pen path in the zone of a particular user interface element.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f4c689" n="0160">An object-indicating tag contains a tag ID which directly identifies a user interface element in the page description associated with the region. All the tags in the
									zone of the user interface element identify the user interface element, making them all identical and therefore indistinguishable. Object-indicating tags do not, therefore, support the
									capture of an absolute pen path. They do, however, support the capture of a relative pen path. So long as the position sampling frequency exceeds twice the encountered tag frequency, the
									displacement from one sampled pen position to the next within a stroke can be unambiguously determined.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6c5b5e" n="0161">With either tagging scheme, the tags function in cooperation with associated visual elements on the netpage as user interactive elements in that a user can interact
									with the printed page using an appropriate sensing device in order for tag data to be read by the sensing device and for an appropriate response to be generated in the netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b4ecf6">1.3 Document and Page Descriptions</p>
								<p xml:id="_48642d" n="0162">A preferred embodiment of a document and page description class diagram is shown in FIGS. 25 and 26.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdb489" n="0163">In the netpage system a document is described at three levels. At the most abstract level the document 836 has a hierarchical structure whose terminal elements 839 are
									associated with content objects 840 such as text objects, text style objects, image objects, etc. Once the document is printed on a printer with a particular page size and according to a
									particular user's scale factor preference, the document is paginated and otherwise formatted. Formatted terminal elements 835 will in some cases be associated with content objects which are
									different from those associated with their corresponding terminal elements, particularly where the content objects are style-related. Each printed instance of a document and page is also
									described separately, to allow input captured through a particular page instance 830 to be recorded separately from input captured through other instances of the same page description.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bcbdba" n="0164">The presence of the most abstract document description on the page server allows a user to request a copy of a document without being forced to accept the source
									document's specific format. The user may be requesting a copy through a printer with a different page size, for example. Conversely, the presence of the formatted document description on the
									page server allows the page server to efficiently interpret user actions on a particular printed page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_912ca5" n="0165">A formatted document 834 consists of a set of formatted page descriptions 5, each of which consists of a set of formatted terminal elements 835. Each formatted element
									has a spatial extent or zone 58 on the page. This defines the active area of input elements such as hyperlinks and input fields.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_64ee08" n="0166">A document instance 831 corresponds to a formatted document 834. It consists of a set of page instances 830, each of which corresponds to a page description 5 of the
									formatted document. Each page instance 830 describes a single unique printed netpage 1, and records the page ID 50 of the netpage. A page instance is not part of a document instance if it
									represents a copy of a page requested in isolation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f487a6" n="0167">A page instance consists of a set of terminal element instances 832. An element instance only exists if it records instance-specific information. Thus, a hyperlink
									instance exists for a hyperlink element because it records a transaction ID 55 which is specific to the page instance, and a field instance exists for a field element because it records input
									specific to the page instance. An element instance does not exist, however, for static elements such as textflows.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a3b41f" n="0168">A terminal element can be a static element 843, a hyperlink element 844, a field element 845 or a page server command element 846, as shown in FIG. 27. A static element
									843 can be a style element 847 with an associated style object 854, a textflow element 848 with an associated styled text object 855, an image element 849 with an associated image element
									856, a graphic element 850 with an associated graphic object 857, a video clip element 851 with an associated video clip object 858, an audio clip element 852 with an associated audio clip
									object 859, or a script element 853 with an associated script object 860, as shown in FIG. 28.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2f3fa3" n="0169">A page instance has a background field 833 which is used to record any digital ink captured on the page which does not apply to a specific input element.</p>
								<p xml:id="_3fc7fa" n="0170">In the preferred form of the invention, a tag map 811 is associated with each page instance to allow tags on the page to be translated into locations on the page.</p>
								<p xml:id="_69f129">1.4 The Netpage Network</p>
								<p xml:id="_249bce" n="0171">In a preferred embodiment, a netpage network consists of a distributed set of netpage page servers 10, netpage registration servers 11, netpage ID servers 12, netpage
									application servers 13, netpage publication servers 14, and netpage printers 601 connected via a network 19 such as the Internet, as shown in FIG. 3.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_790974" n="0172">The netpage registration server 11 is a server which records relationships between users, pens, printers, applications and publications, and thereby authorizes various
									network activities. It authenticates users and acts as a signing proxy on behalf of authenticated users in application transactions. It also provides handwriting recognition services. As
									described above, a netpage page server 10 maintains persistent information about page descriptions and page instances. The netpage network includes any number of page servers, each handling a
									subset of page instances. Since a page server also maintains user input values for each page instance, clients such as netpage printers send netpage input directly to the appropriate page
									server. The page server interprets any such input relative to the description of the corresponding page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_edf5ce" n="0173">A netpage ID server 12 allocates document IDs 51 on demand, and provides load-balancing of page servers via its ID allocation scheme.</p>
								<p xml:id="_2a852c" n="0174">A netpage printer uses the Internet Distributed Name System (DNS), or similar, to resolve a netpage page ID 50 into the network address of the netpage page server
									handling the corresponding page instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a0ef5c" n="0175">A netpage application server 13 is a server which hosts interactive netpage applications. A netpage publication server 14 is an application server which publishes
									netpage documents to netpage printers. They are described in detail in Section 2.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_949c58" n="0176">Netpage servers can be hosted on a variety of network server platforms from manufacturers such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun. Multiple netpage servers can run
									concurrently on a single host, and a single server can be distributed over a number of hosts. Some or all of the functionality provided by netpage servers, and in particular the functionality
									provided by the ID server and the page server, can also be provided directly in a netpage appliance such as a netpage printer, in a computer workstation, or on a local network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f7e6a2">1.5 The Netpage Printer</p>
								<p xml:id="_2809c7" n="0177">The netpage printer 601 is an appliance which is registered with the netpage system and prints netpage documents on demand and via subscription. Each printer has a
									unique printer ID 62, and is connected to the netpage network via a network such as the Internet, ideally via a broadband connection.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bd64ff" n="0178">Apart from identity and security settings in non-volatile memory, the netpage printer contains no persistent storage. As far as a user is concerned, &quot;the network
									is the computer&quot;. Netpages function interactively across space and time with the help of the distributed netpage page servers 10, independently of particular netpage printers.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b08b66" n="0179">The netpage printer receives subscribed netpage documents from netpage publication servers 14. Each document is distributed in two parts: the page layouts, and the
									actual text and image objects which populate the pages. Because of personalization, page layouts are typically specific to a particular subscriber and so are pointcast to the subscriber's
									printer via the appropriate page server. Text and image objects, on the other hand, are typically shared with other subscribers, and so are multicast to all subscribers' printers and the
									appropriate page servers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_cfb3ae" n="0180">The netpage publication server optimizes the segmentation of document content into pointcasts and multicasts. After receiving the pointcast of a document's page
									layouts, the printer knows which multicasts, if any, to listen to.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3015f" n="0181">Once the printer has received the complete page layouts and objects that define the document to be printed, it can print the document.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdf74a" n="0182">The printer rasterizes and prints odd and even pages simultaneously on both sides of the sheet. It contains duplexed print engine controllers 760 and print engines
									utilizing Memjet(TM) printheads 350 for this purpose.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4e28fe" n="0183">The printing process consists of two decoupled stages: rasterization of page descriptions, and expansion and printing of page images. The raster image processor (RIP)
									consists of one or more standard DSPs 757 running in parallel. The duplexed print engine controllers consist of custom processors which expand, dither and print page images in real time,
									synchronized with the operation of the printheads in the print engines.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5ab78b" n="0184">Printers not enabled for IR printing have the option to print tags using IR-absorptive black ink, although this restricts tags to otherwise empty areas of the page.
									Although such pages have more limited functionality than IR-printed pages, they are still classed as netpages.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4c7803" n="0185">A normal netpage printer prints netpages on sheets of paper. More specialised netpage printers may print onto more specialised surfaces, such as globes. Each printer
									supports at least one surface type, and supports at least one tag tiling scheme, and hence tag map, for each surface type. The tag map 811 which describes the tag tiling scheme actually used
									to print a document becomes associated with that document so that the document's tags can be correctly interpreted.

									clearly show the ink inlet 312 that passes through the silicon wafer 301.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ba5627" n="0207">FIGS. 19(a), 19(b) and 19(c) show the operating cycle of a Memjet(TM) printing element 300.</p>
								<p xml:id="_ac1f17" n="0208">FIG. 19(a) shows the quiescent position of the ink meniscus 316 prior to printing an ink droplet. Ink is retained in the nozzle chamber by surface tension at the ink
									meniscus 316 and at the fluidic seal 305 formed between the nozzle chamber 304 and the ink channel rim 306.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_321381" n="0209">While printing, the printhead CMOS circuitry distributes data from the print engine controller to the correct printing element, latches the data, and buffers the data
									to drive the electrodes 318 of the active actuator beam pair 308. This causes an electrical current to pass through the beam pair 308 for about one microsecond, resulting in Joule heating.
									The temperature increase resulting from Joule heating causes the beam pair 308 to expand. As the passive actuator beam pair 309 is not heated, it does not expand, resulting in a stress
									difference between the two beam pairs. This stress difference is partially resolved by the cantilevered end of the electrothermal bend actuator 320 bending towards the substrate 301. The
									lever arm 307 transmits this movement to the nozzle chamber 304. The nozzle chamber 304 moves about two microns to the position shown in FIG. 19(b). This increases the ink pressure, forcing
									ink 321 out of the nozzle 302, and causing the ink meniscus 316 to bulge. The nozzle rim 303 prevents the ink meniscus 316 from spreading across the surface of the nozzle chamber 304.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_af9781" n="0210">As the temperature of the beam pairs 308 and 309 equalizes, the actuator 320 returns to its original position. This aids in the break-off of the ink droplet 317 from
									the ink 321 in the nozzle chamber, as shown in FIG. 19(c). The nozzle chamber is refilled by the action of the surface tension at the meniscus 316.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e3d44e" n="0211">FIG. 20 shows a segment of a printhead 350. In a netpage printer, the length of the printhead is the full width of the paper (typically 210 mm) in the direction 351.
									The segment shown is 0.4 mm long (about 0.2% of a complete printhead). When printing, the paper is moved past the fixed printhead in the direction 352. The printhead has 6 rows of
									interdigitated printing elements 300, printing the six colors or types of ink supplied by the ink inlets 312.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_36bf38" n="0212">To protect the fragile surface of the printhead during operation, a nozzle guard wafer 330 is attached to the printhead substrate 301. For each nozzle 302 there is a
									corresponding nozzle guard hole 331 through which the ink droplets are fired. To prevent the nozzle guard holes 331 from becoming blocked by paper fibers or other debris, filtered air is
									pumped through the air inlets 332 and out of the nozzle guard holes during printing. To prevent ink 321 from drying, the nozzle guard is sealed while the printer is idle.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a978a3">1.6 The Netpage Pen</p>
								<p xml:id="_684f09" n="0213">The active sensing device of the netpage system is typically a pen 101, which, using its embedded controller 134, is able to capture and decode IR position tags from a
									page via an image sensor. The image sensor is a solid-state device provided with an appropriate filter to permit sensing at only near-infrared wavelengths. As described in more detail below,
									the system is able to sense when the nib is in contact with the surface, and the pen is able to sense tags at a sufficient rate to capture human handwriting (i.e. at 200 dpi or greater and
									100 Hz or faster). Information captured by the pen is encrypted and wirelessly transmitted to the printer (or base station), the printer or base station interpreting the data with respect to
									the (known) page structure.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_58aba1" n="0214">The preferred embodiment of the netpage pen operates both as a normal marking ink pen and as a non-marking stylus. The marking aspect, however, is not necessary for
									using the netpage system as a browsing system, such as when it is used as an Internet interface. Each netpage pen is registered with the netpage system and has a unique pen ID 61. FIG. 23
									shows the netpage pen class diagram, reflecting pen-related information maintained by a registration server 11 on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b37548" n="0215">When either nib is in contact with a netpage, the pen determines its position and orientation relative to the page. The nib is attached to a force sensor, and the force
									on the nib is interpreted relative to a threshold to indicate whether the pen is &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;. This allows a interactive element on the page to be 'clicked' by pressing
									with the pen nib, in order to request, say, information from a network. Furthermore, the force is captured as a continuous value to allow, say, the full dynamics of a signature to be
									verified.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1b87a8" n="0216">The pen determines the position and orientation of its nib on the netpage by imaging, in the infrared spectrum, an area 193of the page in the vicinity of the nib. It
									decodes the nearest tag and computes the position of the nib relative to the tag from the observed perspective distortion on the imaged tag and the known geometry of the pen optics. Although
									the position resolution of the tag may be low, because the tag density on the page is inversely proportional to the tag size, the adjusted position resolution is quite high, exceeding the
									minimum resolution required for accurate handwriting recognition.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef1a67" n="0217">Pen actions relative to a netpage are captured as a series of strokes. A stroke consists of a sequence of time-stamped pen positions on the page, initiated by a
									pen-down event and completed by the subsequent pen-up event. A stroke is also tagged with the page ID 50 of the netpage whenever the page ID changes, which, under normal circumstances, is at
									the commencement of the stroke.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c5550c" n="0218">Each netpage pen has a current selection 826 associated with it, allowing the user to perform copy and paste operations etc. The selection is timestamped to allow the
									system to discard it after a defined time period. The current selection describes a region of a page instance. It consists of the most recent digital ink stroke captured through the pen
									relative to the background area of the page. It is interpreted in an application-specific manner once it is submitted to an application via a selection hyperlink activation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fb5101" n="0219">Each pen has a current nib 824. This is the nib last notified by the pen to the system. In the case of the default netpage pen described above, either the marking black
									ink nib or the non-marking stylus nib is current. Each pen also has a current nib style 825. This is the nib style last associated with the pen by an application, e.g. in response to the user
									selecting a color from a palette. The default nib style is the nib style associated with the current nib. Strokes captured through a pen are tagged with the current nib style. When the
									strokes are subsequently reproduced, they are reproduced in the nib style with which they are tagged.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_idP" n="0220">Whenever the pen is within range of a printer with which it can communicate, the pen slowly flashes its &quot;online&quot; LED. When the pen fails to decode a stroke
									relative to the page, it momentarily activates its &quot;error&quot; LED. When the pen succeeds in decoding a stroke relative to the page, it momentarily activates its &quot;ok&quot; LED.</p>
								<p xml:id="_014257" n="0221">A sequence of captured strokes is referred to as digital ink. Digital ink forms the basis for the digital exchange of drawings and handwriting, for online recognition
									of handwriting, and for online verification of signatures.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0eaf8f" n="0222">The pen is wireless and transmits digital ink to the netpage printer via a short-range radio link. The transmitted digital ink is encrypted for privacy and security and
									packetized for efficient transmission, but is always flushed on a pen-up event to ensure timely handling in the printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_93dd9e" n="0223">When the pen is out-of-range of a printer it buffers digital ink in internal memory, which has a capacity of over ten minutes of continuous handwriting. When the pen is
									once again within range of a printer, it transfers any buffered digital ink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_355431" n="0224">A pen can be registered with any number of printers, but because all state data resides in netpages both on paper and on the network, it is largely immaterial which
									printer a pen is communicating with at any particular time.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_986091" n="0225">A preferred embodiment of the pen is described in greater detail in Section 6 below, with reference to FIGS. 8 to 10.</p>
								<p xml:id="_82b677">1.7 Netpage Interaction</p>
								<p xml:id="_82b094" n="0226">The netpage printer 601 receives data relating to a stroke from the pen 101 when the pen is used to interact with a netpage 1. The coded data 3 of the tags 4 is read by
									the pen when it is used to execute a movement, such as a stroke. The data allows the identity of the particular page and associated interactive element to be determined and an indication of
									the relative positioning of the pen relative to the page to be obtained. The indicating data is transmitted to the printer, where it resolves, via the DNS, the page ID 50 of the stroke into
									the network address of the netpage page server 10 which maintains the corresponding page instance 830. It then transmits the stroke to the page server. If the page was recently identified in
									an earlier stroke, then the printer may already have the address of the relevant page server in its cache. Each netpage consists of a compact page layout maintained persistently by a netpage
									page server (see below). The page layout refers to objects such as images, fonts and pieces of text, typically stored elsewhere on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e508c2" n="0227">When the page server receives the stroke from the pen, it retrieves the page description to which the stroke applies, and determines which element of the page
									description the stroke intersects. It is then able to interpret the stroke in the context of the type of the relevant element.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3537c4" n="0228">A &quot;click&quot; is a stroke where the distance and time between the pen down position and the subsequent pen up position are both less than some small maximum. An
									object which is activated by a click typically requires a click to be activated, and accordingly, a longer stroke is ignored. The failure of a pen action, such as a &quot;sloppy&quot; click,
									to register is indicated by the lack of response from the pen's &quot;ok&quot; LED.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0c0f0e" n="0229">There are two kinds of input elements in a netpage page description: hyperlinks and form fields. Input through a form field can also trigger the activation of an
									associated hyperlink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c22301">1.7.1 Hyperlinks</p>
								<p xml:id="_c2352b" n="0230">A hyperlink is a means of sending a message to a remote application, and typically elicits a printed response in the netpage system.</p>
								<p xml:id="_d9af7e" n="0231">A hyperlink element 844 identifies the application 71 which handles activation of the hyperlink, a link ID 54 which identifies the hyperlink to the application, an
									&quot;alias required&quot; flag which asks the system to include the user's application alias ID 65 in the hyperlink activation, and a description which is used when the hyperlink is recorded
									as a favorite or appears in the user's history. The hyperlink element class diagram is shown in FIG. 29.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_621612" n="0232">When a hyperlink is activated, the page server sends a request to an application somewhere on the network. The application is identified by an application ID 64, and
									the application ID is resolved in the normal way via the DNS. There are three types of hyperlinks: general hyperlinks 863, form hyperlinks 865, and selection hyperlinks 864, as shown in FIG.
									30. A general hyperlink can implement a request for a linked document, or may simply signal a preference to a server. A form hyperlink submits the corresponding form to the application. A
									selection hyperlink submits the current selection to the application. If the current selection contains a single-word piece of text, for example, the application may return a single-page
									document giving the word's meaning within the context in which it appears, or a translation into a different language. Each hyperlink type is characterized by what information is submitted to
									the application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_de6e28" n="0233">The corresponding hyperlink instance 862 records a transaction ID 55 which can be specific to the page instance on which the hyperlink instance appears. The transaction
									ID can identify user-specific data to the application, for example a &quot;shopping cart&quot; of pending purchases maintained by a purchasing application on behalf of the user.</p>
								<p xml:id="_3ad090" n="0234">The system includes the pen's current selection 826 in a selection hyperlink activation. The system includes the content of the associated form instance 868 in a form
									hyperlink activation, although if the hyperlink has its &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute set, only input since the last form submission is included. The system includes an effective return
									path in all hyperlink activations.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_050424" n="0235">A hyperlinked group 866 is a group element 838 which has an associated hyperlink, as shown in FIG. 31. When input occurs through any field element in the group, the
									hyperlink 844 associated with the group is activated. A hyperlinked group can be used to associate hyperlink behavior with a field such as a checkbox. It can also be used, in conjunction with
									the &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute of a form hyperlink, to provide continuous input to an application. It can therefore be used to support a &quot;blackboard&quot; interaction model, i.e.
									where input is captured and therefore shared as soon as it occurs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_444c19">1.7.2 Forms</p>
								<p xml:id="_09c48e" n="0236">A form defines a collection of related input fields used to capture a related set of inputs through a printed netpage. A form allows a user to submit one or more
									parameters to an application software program running on a server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_19d361" n="0237">A form 867 is a group element 838 in the document hierarchy. It ultimately contains a set of terminal field elements 839. A form instance 868 represents a printed
									instance of a form. It consists of a set of field instances 870 which correspond to the field elements 845 of the form. Each field instance has an associated value 871, whose type depends on
									the type of the corresponding field element. Each field value records input through a particular printed form instance, i.e. through one or more printed netpages. The form class diagram is
									shown in FIG. 32.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_220200" n="0238">Each form instance has a status 872 which indicates whether the form is active, frozen, submitted, void or expired. A form is active when first printed. A form becomes
									frozen once it is signed. A form becomes submitted once one of its submission hyperlinks has been activated, unless the hyperlink has its &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute set. A form
									becomes void when the user invokes a void form, reset form or duplicate form page command. A form expires when the time the form has been active exceeds the form's specified lifetime. While
									the form is active, form input is allowed. Input through a form which is not active is instead captured in the background field 833 of the relevant page instance. When the form is active or
									frozen, form submission is allowed. Any attempt to submit a form when the form is not active or frozen is rejected, and instead elicits an form status report.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a1292" n="0239">Each form instance is associated (at 59) with any form instances derived from it, thus providing a version history. This allows all but the latest version of a form in
									a particular time period to be excluded from a search.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d65d72" n="0240">All input is captured as digital ink. Digital ink 873 consists of a set of timestamped stroke groups 874, each of which consists of a set of styled strokes 875. Each
									stroke consists of a set of timestamped pen positions 876, each of which also includes pen orientation and nib force. The digital ink class diagram is shown in FIG. 33.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdee2f" n="0241">A field element 845 can be a checkbox field 877, a text field 878, a drawing field 879, or a signature field 880. The field element class diagram is shown in FIG. 34.
									Any digital ink captured in a field's zone 58 is assigned to the field.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef2dad" n="0242">A checkbox field has an associated boolean value 881, as shown in FIG. 35. Any mark (a tick, a cross, a stroke, a fill zigzag, etc.) captured in a checkbox field's zone
									causes a true value to be assigned to the field's value.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d19e45" n="0243">A text field has an associated text value 882, as shown in FIG. 36. Any digital ink captured in a text field's zone is automatically converted to text via online
									handwriting recognition, and the text is assigned to the field's value. Online handwriting recognition is well-understood (see for example Tappert, C., C. Y. Suen and T. Wakahara, &quot;The
									State of the Art in On-Line Handwriting Recognition&quot;, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 12, No. 8, August 1990).</p>
								<p xml:id="_be4a8f" n="0244">A signature field has an associated digital signature value 883, as shown in FIG. 37. Any digital ink captured in a signature field's zone is automatically verified
									with respect to the identity of the owner of the pen, and a digital signature of the content of the form of which the field is part is generated and assigned to the field's value. The digital
									signature is generated using the pen user's private signature key specific to the application which owns the form. Online signature verification is well-understood (see for example Plamondon,
									R. and G. Lorette, &quot;Automatic Signature Verification and Writer Identification-The State of the Art&quot;, Pattern Recognition, Vol. 22, No. 2, 1989).</p>
								<p xml:id="_d88b12" n="0245">A field element is hidden if its &quot;hidden&quot; attribute is set. A hidden field element does not have an input zone on a page and does not accept input. It can
									have an associated field value which is included in the form data when the form containing the field is submitted.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c4e519" n="0246">&quot;Editing&quot; commands, such as strike-throughs indicating deletion, can also be recognized in form fields.</p>
								<p xml:id="_c6456f" n="0247">Because the handwriting recognition algorithm works &quot;online&quot; (i.e. with access to the dynamics of the pen movement), rather than &quot;offline&quot; (i.e.
									with access only to a bitmap of pen markings), it can recognize run-on discretely-written characters with relatively high accuracy, without a writer-dependent training phase. A
									writer-dependent model of handwriting is automatically generated over time, however, and can be generated up-front if necessary,
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ae0bb7" n="0248">Digital ink, as already stated, consists of a sequence of strokes. Any stroke which starts in a particular element's zone is appended to that element's digital ink
									stream, ready for interpretation. Any stroke not appended to an object's digital ink stream is appended to the background field's digital ink stream.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_62ea2e" n="0249">Digital ink captured in the background field is interpreted as a selection gesture. Circumscription of one or more objects is generally interpreted as a selection of
									the circumscribed objects, although the actual interpretation is application-specific.

									cleared after an inactivity timeout to ensure predictable behavior.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_461fe9" n="0252">The raw digital ink captured in every field is retained on the netpage page server and is optionally transmitted with the form data when the form is submitted to the
									application. This allows the application to interrogate the raw digital ink should it suspect the original conversion, such as the conversion of handwritten text. This can, for example,
									involve human intervention at the application level for forms which fail certain application-specific consistency checks. As an extension to this, the entire background area of a form can be
									designated as a drawing field. The application can then decide, on the basis of the presence of digital ink outside the explicit fields of the form, to route the form to a human operator, on
									the assumption that the user may have indicated amendments to the filled-in fields outside of those fields.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9850ad" n="0253">FIG. 38 shows a flowchart of the process of handling pen input relative to a netpage. The process consists of receiving (at 884) a stroke from the pen; identifying (at
									885) the page instance 830 to which the page ID 50 in the stroke refers; retrieving (at 886) the page description 5; identifying (at 887) a formatted element 839 whose zone 58 the stroke
									intersects; determining (at 888) whether the formatted element corresponds to a field element, and if so appending (at 892) the received stroke to the digital ink of the field value 871,
									interpreting (at 893) the accumulated digital ink of the field, and determining (at 894) whether the field is part of a hyperlinked group 866 and if so activating (at 895) the associated
									hyperlink; alternatively determining (at 889) whether the formatted element corresponds to a hyperlink element and if so activating (at 895) the corresponding hyperlink; alternatively, in the
									absence of an input field or hyperlink, appending (at 890) the received stroke to the digital ink of the background field 833; and copying (at 891) the received stroke to the current
									selection 826 of the current pen, as maintained by the registration server.

								<p xml:id="_eba98a">1.7.3 Page Server Commands</p>
								<p xml:id="_a73a04" n="0255">A page server command is a command which is handled locally by the page server. It operates directly on form, page and document instances.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bc0b68" n="0256">A page server command 907 can be a void form command 908, a duplicate form command 909, a reset form command 910, a get form status command 911, a duplicate page
									command 912, a reset page command 913, a get page status command 914, a duplicate document command 915, a reset document command 916, or a get document status command 917, as shown in FIG.
									39.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_16a8fc" n="0257">A void form command voids the corresponding form instance. A duplicate form command voids the corresponding form instance and then produces an active printed copy of
									the current form instance with field values preserved. The copy contains the same hyperlink transaction IDs as the original, and so is indistinguishable from the original to an application. A
									reset form command voids the corresponding form instance and then produces an active printed copy of the form instance with field values discarded. A get form status command produces a
									printed report on the status of the corresponding form instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the form status of the form instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_59e27a" n="0258">Since a form hyperlink instance contains a transaction ID, the application has to be involved in producing a new form instance. A button requesting a new form instance
									is therefore typically implemented as a hyperlink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7c20e9" n="0259">A duplicate page command produces a printed copy of the corresponding page instance with the background field value preserved. If the page contains a form or is part of
									a form, then the duplicate page command is interpreted as a duplicate form command. A reset page command produces a printed copy of the corresponding page instance with the background field
									value discarded. If the page contains a form or is part of a form, then the reset page command is interpreted as a reset form command. A get page status command produces a printed report on
									the status of the corresponding page instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the status of any forms it contains or is part of.

								<p xml:id="_896c70" n="0262">A duplicate document command produces a printed copy of the corresponding document instance with background field values preserved. If the document contains any forms,
									then the duplicate document command duplicates the forms in the same way a duplicate form command does. A reset document command produces a printed copy of the corresponding document instance
									with background field values discarded. If the document contains any forms, then the reset document command resets the forms in the same way a reset form command does. A get document status
									command produces a printed report on the status of the corresponding document instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the status of any forms
									it contains.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0ebce0" n="0263">If the page server command's &quot;on selected&quot; attribute is set, then the command operates on the page identified by the pen's current selection rather than on
									the page containing the command. This allows a menu of page server commands to be printed. If the target page doesn't contain a page server command element for the designated page server
									command, then the command is ignored.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_66c0d8" n="0264">An application can provide application-specific handling by embedding the relevant page server command element in a hyperlinked group. The page server activates the
									hyperlink associated with the hyperlinked group rather than executing the page server command.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c9cb3f" n="0265">A page server command element is hidden if its &quot;hidden&quot; attribute is set. A hidden command element does not have an input zone on a page and so cannot be
									activated directly by a user. It can, however, be activated via a page server command embedded in a different page, if that page server command has its &quot;on selected&quot; attribute set.

								<p xml:id="_f228a6">1.8 Standard Features of Netpages</p>
								<p xml:id="_cdf0dc" n="0266">In the preferred form, each netpage is printed with the netpage logo at the bottom to indicate that it is a netpage and therefore has interactive properties. The logo
									also acts as a copy button. In most cases pressing the logo produces a copy of the page. In the case of a form, the button produces a copy of the entire form. And in the case of a secure
									document, such as a ticket or coupon, the button elicits an explanatory note or advertising page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1e47cf" n="0267">The default single-page copy function is handled directly by the relevant netpage page server. Special copy functions are handled by linking the logo button to an
									application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9f1c5c">1.9 User Help System</p>
								<p xml:id="_5da2f9" n="0268">In a preferred embodiment, the netpage printer has a single button labelled &quot;Help&quot;. When pressed it elicits a single page of information, including:</p>
								<p xml:id="_7f29f3" n="0269">status of printer connection</p>
								<p xml:id="_822f14" n="0270">status of printer consumables</p>

								<p xml:id="_7dd785" n="0275">The document function menu includes the following functions:</p>
								<p xml:id="_903d27" n="0276">print a copy of a document</p>
								<p xml:id="_ba41c3" n="0277">print a clean copy of a form</p>
								<p xml:id="_b6efe8" n="0278">print the status of a document</p>
								<p xml:id="_0807ff" n="0279">A document function is initiated by simply pressing the button and then touching any page of the document. The status of a document indicates who published it and when,
									to whom it was delivered, and to whom and when it was subsequently submitted as a form.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b44807" n="0280">The netpage network directory allows the user to navigate the hierarchy of publications and services on the network. As an alternative, the user can call the netpage
									network &quot;900&quot; number &quot;yellow pages&quot; and speak to a human operator. The operator can locate the desired document and route it to the user's printer. Depending on the
									document type, the publisher or the user pays the small &quot;yellow pages&quot; service fee.</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a7bad" n="0281">The help page is obviously unavailable if the printer is unable to print. In this case the &quot;error&quot; light is lit and the user can request remote diagnosis over
									the network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d62616">2 Personalized Publication Model</p>
								<p xml:id="_af575a" n="0282">In the following description, news is used as a canonical publication example to illustrate personalization mechanisms in the netpage system. Although news is often
									used in the limited sense of newspaper and newsmagazine news, the intended scope in the present context is wider.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_77e429" n="0283">In the netpage system, the editorial content and the advertising content of a news publication are personalized using different mechanisms. The editorial content is
									personalized according to the reader's explicitly stated and implicitly captured interest profile. The advertising content is personalized according to the reader's locality and demographic.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_654b2a">2.1 Editorial Personalization</p>
								<p xml:id="_fe217d" n="0284">A subscriber can draw on two kinds of news sources: those that deliver news publications, and those that deliver news streams. While news publications are aggregated
									and edited by the publisher, news streams are aggregated either by a news publisher or by a specialized news aggregator. News publications typically correspond to traditional newspapers and
									newsmagazines, while news streams can be many and varied: a &quot;raw&quot; news feed from a news service, a cartoon strip, a freelance writer's column, a friend's bulletin board, or the
									reader's own e-mail.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_630e53" n="0285">The netpage publication server supports the publication of edited news publications as well as the aggregation of multiple news streams. By handling the aggregation and
									hence the formatting of news streams selected directly by the reader, the server is able to place advertising on pages over which it otherwise has no editorial control.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1592d2" n="0286">The subscriber builds a daily newspaper by selecting one or more contributing news publications, and creating a personalized version of each. The resulting daily
									editions are printed and bound together into a single newspaper. The various members of a household typically express their different interests and tastes by selecting different daily
									publications and then customizing them.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aecce0" n="0287">For each publication, the reader optionally selects specific sections. Some sections appear daily, while others appear weekly. The daily sections available from The New
									York Times online, for example, include &quot;Page One Plus&quot;, &quot;National&quot;, &quot;International&quot;, &quot;Opinion&quot;, &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Arts/Living&quot;,
									&quot;Technology&quot;, and &quot;Sports&quot;. The set of available sections is specific to a publication, as is the default subset.</p>
								<p xml:id="_051aca" n="0288">The reader can extend the daily newspaper by creating custom sections, each one drawing on any number of news streams. Custom sections might be created for e-mail and
									friends' announcements (&quot;Personal&quot;), or for monitoring news feeds for specific topics (&quot;Alerts&quot; or &quot;Clippings&quot;).</p>
								<p xml:id="_92c533" n="0289">For each section, the reader optionally specifies its size, either qualitatively (e.g. short, medium, or long), or numerically (i.e. as a limit on its number of pages),
									and the desired proportion of advertising, either qualitatively (e.g. high, normal, low, none), or numerically (i.e. as a percentage).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_becd46" n="0290">The reader also optionally expresses a preference for a large number of shorter articles or a small number of longer articles. Each article is ideally written (or
									edited) in both short and long forms to support this preference.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_14698a" n="0291">An article may also be written (or edited) in different versions to match the expected sophistication of the reader, for example to provide children's and adults'
									versions. The appropriate version is selected according to the reader's age. The reader can specify a &quot;reading age&quot; which takes precedence over their biological age.</p>
								<p xml:id="_98e608" n="0292">The articles which make up each section are selected and prioritized by the editors, and each is assigned a useful lifetime. By default they are delivered to all
									relevant subscribers, in priority order, subject to space constraints in the subscribers' editions.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f5a9f6" n="0293">In sections where it is appropriate, the reader may optionally enable collaborative filtering. This is then applied to articles which have a sufficiently long lifetime.
									Each article which qualifies for collaborative filtering is printed with rating buttons at the end of the article. The buttons can provide an easy choice (e.g. &quot;liked&quot; and
									&quot;disliked&quot;), making it more likely that readers will bother to rate the article.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b171b9" n="0294">Articles with high priorities and short lifetimes are therefore effectively considered essential reading by the editors and are delivered to most relevant subscribers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1bc0ef" n="0295">The reader optionally specifies a serendipity factor, either qualitatively (e.g. do or don't surprise me), or numerically. A high serendipity factor lowers the
									threshold used for matching during collaborative filtering. A high factor makes it more likely that the corresponding section will be filled to the reader's specified capacity. A different
									serendipity factor can be specified for different days of the week.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d4fe85" n="0296">The reader also optionally specifies topics of particular interest within a section, and this modifies the priorities assigned by the editors.</p>
								<p xml:id="_430936" n="0297">The speed of the reader's Internet connection affects the quality at which images can be delivered. The reader optionally specifies a preference for fewer images or
									smaller images or both. If the number or size of images is not reduced, then images may be delivered at lower quality (i.e. at lower resolution or with greater compression).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d65e25" n="0298">At a global level, the reader specifies how quantities, dates, times and monetary values are localized. This involves specifying whether units are imperial or metric, a
									local timezone and time format, and a local currency, and whether the localization consist of in situ translation or annotation. These preferences are derived from the reader's locality by
									default.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fede65" n="0299">To reduce reading difficulties caused by poor eyesight, the reader optionally specifies a global preference for a larger presentation. Both text and images are scaled
									accordingly, and less information is accommodated on each page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a51deb" n="0300">The language in which a news publication is published, and its corresponding text encoding, is a property of the publication and not a preference expressed by the user.
									However, the netpage system can be configured to provide automatic translation services in various guises.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d24b52">2.2 Advertising Localization and Targeting</p>
								<p xml:id="_5448c6" n="0301">The personalization of the editorial content directly affects the advertising content, because advertising is typically placed to exploit the editorial context. Travel
									ads, for example, are more likely to appear in a travel section than elsewhere. The value of the editorial content to an advertiser (and therefore to the publisher) lies in its ability to
									attract large numbers of readers with the right demographics.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ceadcc" n="0302">Effective advertising is placed on the basis of locality and demographics. Locality determines proximity to particular services, retailers etc., and particular
									interests and concerns associated with the local community and environment. Demographics determine general interests and preoccupations as well as likely spending patterns.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f1a62a" n="0303">A news publisher's most profitable product is advertising &quot;space&quot;, a multi-dimensional entity determined by the publication's geographic coverage, the size of
									its readership, its readership demographics, and the page area available for advertising.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3ab7ba" n="0304">In the netpage system, the netpage publication server computes the approximate multi-dimensional size of a publication's saleable advertising space on a per-section
									basis, taking into account the publication's geographic coverage, the section's readership, the size of each reader's section edition, each reader's advertising proportion, and each reader's
									demographic.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_865bf3" n="0305">In comparison with other media, the netpage system allows the advertising space to be defined in greater detail, and allows smaller pieces of it to be sold separately.
									It therefore allows it to be sold at closer to its true value.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f59bb5" n="0306">For example, the same advertising &quot;slot&quot; can be sold in varying proportions to several advertisers, with individual readers' pages randomly receiving the
									advertisement of one advertiser or another, overall preserving the proportion of space sold to each advertiser.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_11b57f" n="0307">The netpage system allows advertising to be linked directly to detailed product information and online purchasing. It therefore raises the intrinsic value of the
									advertising space.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbc07b" n="0308">Because personalization and localization are handled automatically by netpage publication servers, an advertising aggregator can provide arbitrarily broad coverage of
									both geography and demographics. The subsequent disaggregation is efficient because it is automatic. This makes it more cost-effective for publishers to deal with advertising aggregators than
									to directly capture advertising. Even though the advertising aggregator is taking a proportion of advertising revenue, publishers may find the change profit-neutral because of the greater
									efficiency of aggregation. The advertising aggregator acts as an intermediary between advertisers and publishers, and may place the same advertisement in multiple publications.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9ef994" n="0309">It is worth noting that ad placement in a netpage publication can be more complex than ad placement in the publication's traditional counterpart, because the
									publication's advertising space is more complex. While ignoring the full complexities of negotiations between advertisers, advertising aggregators and publishers, the preferred form of the
									netpage system provides some automated support for these negotiations, including support for automated auctions of advertising space. Automation is particularly desirable for the placement of
									advertisements which generate small amounts of income, such as small or highly localized advertisements.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ed91b3" n="0310">Once placement has been negotiated, the aggregator captures and edits the advertisement and records it on a netpage ad server. Correspondingly, the publisher records
									the ad placement on the relevant netpage publication server. When the netpage publication server lays out each user's personalized publication, it picks the relevant advertisements from the
									netpage ad server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_23ae19">2.3 User Profiles</p>
								<p xml:id="_dcf36d">2.3.1 Information Filtering</p>
								<p xml:id="_3a8999" n="0311">The personalization of news and other publications relies on an assortment of user-specific profile information, including:</p>
								<p xml:id="_78c0ea" n="0312">publication customizations</p>
								<p xml:id="_b529c2" n="0313">collaborative filtering vectors</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f5aee" n="0314">contact details</p>
								<p xml:id="_edd7e4" n="0315">presentation preferences</p>
								<p xml:id="_0adfd4" n="0316">The customization of a publication is typically publication-specific, and so the customization information is maintained by the relevant netpage publication server.</p>
								<p xml:id="_fcbd92" n="0317">A collaborative filtering vector consists of the user's ratings of a number of news items. It is used to correlate different users' interests for the purposes of making
									recommendations. Although there are benefits to maintaining a single collaborative filtering vector independently of any particular publication, there are two reasons why it is more practical
									to maintain a separate vector for each publication: there is likely to be more overlap between the vectors of subscribers to the same publication than between those of subscribers to
									different publications; and a publication is likely to want to present its users' collaborative filtering vectors as part of the value of its brand, not to be found elsewhere. Collaborative
									filtering vectors are therefore also maintained by the relevant netpage publication server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4c7536" n="0318">Contact details, including name, street address, ZIP Code, state, country, telephone numbers, are global by nature, and are maintained by a netpage registration server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ec69e0" n="0319">Presentation preferences, including those for quantities, dates and times, are likewise global and maintained in the same way.</p>
								<p xml:id="_f1bf81" n="0320">The localization of advertising relies on the locality indicated in the user's contact details, while the targeting of advertising relies on personal information such
									as date of birth, gender, marital status, income, profession, education, or qualitative derivatives such as age range and income range.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5f5edc" n="0321">For those users who choose to reveal personal information for advertising purposes, the information is maintained by the relevant netpage registration server. In the
									absence of such information, advertising can be targeted on the basis of the demographic associated with the user's ZIP or ZIP+4 Code.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e4cc66" n="0322">Each user, pen, printer, application provider and application is assigned its own unique identifier, and the netpage registration server maintains the relationships
									between them, as shown in FIGS. 21, 22, 23 and 24. For registration purposes, a publisher is a special kind of application provider, and a publication is a special kind of application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_92e641" n="0323">Each user 800 may be authorized to use any number of printers 802, and each printer may allow any number of users to use it. Each user has a single default printer (at
									66), to which periodical publications are delivered by default, whilst pages printed on demand are delivered to the printer through which the user is interacting. The server keeps track of
									which publishers a user has authorized to print to the user's default printer. A publisher does not record the ID of any particular printer, but instead resolves the ID when it is required.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4c5140" n="0324">When a user subscribes 808 to a publication 807, the publisher 806 (i.e. application provider 803) is authorized to print to a specified printer or the user's default
									printer. This authorization can be revoked at any time by the user. Each user may have several pens 801, but a pen is specific to a single user. If a user is authorized to use a particular
									printer, then that printer recognizes any of the user's pens.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_70db8b" n="0325">The pen ID is used to locate the corresponding user profile maintained by a particular netpage registration server, via the DNS in the usual way.</p>
								<p xml:id="_aba516" n="0326">A Web terminal 809 can be authorized to print on a particular netpage printer, allowing Web pages and netpage documents encountered during Web browsing to be
									conveniently printed on the nearest netpage printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6486ba" n="0327">The netpage system can collect, on behalf of a printer provider, fees and commissions on income earned through publications printed on the provider's printers. Such
									income can include advertising fees, click-through fees, e-commerce commissions, and transaction fees. If the printer is owned by the user, then the user is the printer provider.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ec5919" n="0328">Each user also has a netpage account 820 which is used to accumulate micro-debits and credits (such as those described in the preceding paragraph); contact details 815,
									including name, address and telephone numbers; global preferences 816, including privacy, delivery and localization settings; any number of biometric records 817, containing the user's
									encoded signature 818, fingerprint 819 etc; a handwriting model 819 automatically maintained by the system; and SET payment card accounts 821 with which e-commerce payments can be made.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9991a8">2.3.2 Favorites List</p>
								<p xml:id="_b245fb" n="0329">A netpage user can maintain a list 922 of &quot;favorites&quot;-links to useful documents etc. on the netpage network. The list is maintained by the system on the
									user's behalf It is organized as a hierarchy of folders 924, a preferrred embodiment of which is shown in the class diagram in FIG. 41.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a5dec3">2.3.3 History List</p>
								<p xml:id="_559bbe" n="0330">The system maintains a history list 929 on each user's behalf, containing links to documents etc. accessed by the user through the netpage system. It is organized as a
									date-ordered list, a preferred embodiment of which is shown in the class diagram in FIG. 42.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_09a75f">2.4 Intelligent Page Layout</p>
								<p xml:id="_76f517" n="0331">The netpage publication server automatically lays out the pages of each user's personalized publication on a section-by-section basis. Since most advertisements are in
									the form of pre-formatted rectangles, they are placed on the page before the editorial content.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0260b6" n="0332">The advertising ratio for a section can be achieved with wildly varying advertising ratios on individual pages within the section, and the ad layout algorithm exploits
									this. The algorithm is configured to attempt to co-locate closely tied editorial and advertising content, such as placing ads for roofing material specifically within the publication because
									of a special feature on do-it-yourself roofing repairs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0017eb" n="0333">The editorial content selected for the user, including text and associated images and graphics, is then laid out according to various aesthetic rules.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a374c1" n="0334">The entire process, including the selection of ads and the selection of editorial content, must be iterated once the layout has converged, to attempt to more closely
									achieve the user's stated section size preference. The section size preference can, however, be matched on average over time, allowing significant day-to-day variations.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0db30b">2.5 Document Format</p>
								<p xml:id="_f8e58a" n="0335">Once the document is laid out, it is encoded for efficient distribution and persistent storage on the netpage network.</p>
								<p xml:id="_fd2c88" n="0336">The primary efficiency mechanism is the separation of information specific to a single user's edition and information shared between multiple users' editions. The
									specific information consists of the page layout. The shared information consists of the objects to which the page layout refers, including images, graphics, and pieces of text.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b9becf" n="0337">A text object contains fully-formatted text represented in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) using the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). XSL provides precise
									control over text formatting independently of the region into which the text is being set, which in this case is being provided by the layout. The text object contains embedded language codes
									to enable automatic translation, and embedded hyphenation hints to aid with paragraph formatting.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_788564" n="0338">An image object encodes an image in the JPEG 2000 wavelet-based compressed image format. A graphic object encodes a 2D graphic in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3a6e9c" n="0339">
									The layout itself consists of a series of placed image and graphic objects, linked textflow objects through which text objects flow, hyperlinks and input fields as described above, and

								<p xml:id="_c99a91" n="0340">As described above, for purposes of efficient distribution and persistent storage on the netpage network, a user-specific page layout is separated from the shared
									objects to which it refers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_756bee" n="0341">When a subscribed publication is ready to be distributed, the netpage publication server allocates, with the help of the netpage ID server 12, a unique ID for each
									page, page instance, document, and document instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bee7a6" n="0342">The server computes a set of optimized subsets of the shared content and creates a multicast channel for each subset, and then tags each user-specific layout with the
									names of the multicast channels which will carry the shared content used by that layout. The server then pointcasts each user's layouts to that user's printer via the appropriate page server,
									and when the pointcasting is complete, multicasts the shared content on the specified channels. After receiving its pointcast, each page server and printer subscribes to the multicast
									channels specified in the page layouts. During the multicasts, each page server and printer extracts from the multicast streams those objects referred to by its page layouts. The page servers
									persistently archive the received page layouts and shared content.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b33be1" n="0343">Once a printer has received all the objects to which its page layouts refer, the printer re-creates the fully-populated layout and then rasterizes and prints it.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0415eb" n="0344">Under normal circumstances, the printer prints pages faster than they can be delivered. Assuming a quarter of each page is covered with images, the average page has a
									size of less than 400 KB. The printer can therefore hold in excess of 100 such pages in its internal 64 MB memory, allowing for temporary buffers etc. The printer prints at a rate of one page
									per second. This is equivalent to 400 KB or about 3 Mbit of page data per second, which is similar to the highest expected rate of page data delivery over a broadband network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f93fa9" n="0345">Even under abnormal circumstances, such as when the printer runs out of paper, it is likely that the user will be able to replenish the paper supply before the
									printer's 100-page internal storage capacity is exhausted.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_41a7a0" n="0346">However, if the printer's internal memory does fill up, then the printer will be unable to make use of a multicast when it first occurs. The netpage publication server
									therefore allows printers to submit requests for re-multicasts. When a critical number of requests is received or a timeout occurs, the server re-multicasts the corresponding shared objects.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_883f94" n="0347">Once a document is printed, a printer can produce an exact duplicate at any time by retrieving its page layouts and contents from the relevant page server.</p>
								<p xml:id="_eb9e70">2.7 On-Demand Documents</p>
								<p xml:id="_df43b3" n="0348">When a netpage document is requested on demand, it can be personalized and delivered in much the same way as a periodical. However, since there is no shared content,
									delivery is made directly to the requesting printer without the use of multicast.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1588c9" n="0349">When a non-netpage document is requested on demand, it is not personalized, and it is delivered via a designated netpage formatting server which reformats it as a
									netpage document. A netpage formatting server is a special instance of a netpage publication server. The netpage formatting server has knowledge of various Internet document formats,
									including Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In the case of HTML, it can make use of the higher resolution of the printed page to present Web pages
									in a multi-column format, with a table of contents. It can automatically include all Web pages directly linked to the requested page. The user can tune this behavior via a preference.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_17dd33" n="0350">The netpage formatting server makes standard netpage behavior, including interactivity and persistence, available on any Internet document, no matter what its origin
									and format. It hides knowledge of different document formats from both the netpage printer and the netpage page server, and hides knowledge of the netpage system from Web servers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_864685">3 Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_6bda41">3.1 Cryptography</p>
								<p xml:id="_955228" n="0351">Cryptography is used to protect sensitive information, both in storage and in transit, and to authenticate parties to a transaction. There are two classes of
									cryptography in widespread use: secret-key cryptography and public-key cryptography. The netpage network uses both classes of cryptography.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_86f37d" n="0352">Secret-key cryptography, also referred to as symmetric cryptography, uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. Two parties wishing to exchange messages must
									first arrange to securely exchange the secret key.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_cd6a32" n="0353">Public-key cryptography, also referred to as asymmetric cryptography, uses two encryption keys. The two keys are mathematically related in such a way that any message
									encrypted using one key can only be decrypted using the other key. One of these keys is then published, while the other is kept private. The public key is used to encrypt any message intended
									for the holder of the private key. Once encrypted using the public key, a message can only be decrypted using the private key. Thus two parties can securely exchange messages without first
									having to exchange a secret key. To ensure that the private key is secure, it is normal for the holder of the private key to generate the key pair.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e2acc3" n="0354">Public-key cryptography can be used to create a digital signature. The holder of the private key can create a known hash of a message and then encrypt the hash using
									the private key. Anyone can then verify that the encrypted hash constitutes the &quot;signature&quot; of the holder of the private key with respect to that particular message by decrypting
									the encrypted hash using the public key and verifying the hash against the message. If the signature is appended to the message, then the recipient of the message can verify both that the
									message is genuine and that it has not been altered in transit.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_12c197" n="0355">To make public-key cryptography work, there has to be a way to distribute public keys which prevents impersonation. This is normally done using certificates and
									certificate authorities. A certificate authority is a trusted third party which authenticates the connection between a public key and someone's identity. The certificate authority verifies
									the person's identity by examining identity documents, and then creates and signs a digital certificate containing the person's identity details and public key. Anyone who trusts the
									certificate authority can use the public key in the certificate with a high degree of certainty that it is genuine. They just have to verify that the certificate has indeed been signed by the
									certificate authority, whose public key is well-known.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_de9df7" n="0356">In most transaction environments, public-key cryptography is only used to create digital signatures and to securely exchange secret session keys. Secret-key
									cryptography is used for all other purposes.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_32fdfa" n="0357">In the following discussion, when reference is made to the secure transmission of information between a netpage printer and a server, what actually happens is that the
									printer obtains the server's certificate, authenticates it with reference to the certificate authority, uses the public key-exchange key in the certificate to exchange a secret session key
									with the server, and then uses the secret session key to encrypt the message data. A session key, by definition, can have an arbitrarily short lifetime.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_828eee">3.2 Netpage Printer Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_00b2d4" n="0358">Each netpage printer is assigned a pair of unique identifiers at time of manufacture which are stored in read-only memory in the printer and in the netpage registration
									server database. The first ID 62 is public and uniquely identifies the printer on the netpage network. The second ID is secret and is used when the printer is first registered on the network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_611ce4" n="0359">When the printer connects to the netpage network for the first time after installation, it creates a signature public/private key pair. It transmits the secret ID and
									the public key securely to the netpage registration server. The server compares the secret ID against the printer's secret ID recorded in its database, and accepts the registration if the IDs
									match. It then creates and signs a certificate containing the printer's public ID and public signature key, and stores the certificate in the registration database.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_00599b" n="0360">The netpage registration server acts as a certificate authority for netpage printers, since it has access to secret information allowing it to verify printer identity.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bb2c91" n="0361">When a user subscribes to a publication, a record is created in the netpage registration server database authorizing the publisher to print the publication to the
									user's default printer or a specified printer. Every document sent to a printer via a page server is addressed to a particular user and is signed by the publisher using the publisher's
									private signature key. The page server verifies, via the registration database, that the publisher is authorized to deliver the publication to the specified user. The page server verifies the
									signature using the publisher's public key, obtained from the publisher's certificate stored in the registration database.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b55ed1" n="0362">The netpage registration server accepts requests to add printing authorizations to the database, so long as those requests are initiated via a pen registered to the
									printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d522d5">3.3 Netpage Pen Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_9df129" n="0363">Each netpage pen is assigned a unique identifier at time of manufacture which is stored in read-only memory in the pen and in the netpage registration server database.
									The pen ID 61 uniquely identifies the pen on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_8618a7" n="0364">A netpage pen can &quot;know&quot; a number of netpage printers, and a printer can &quot;know&quot; a number of pens. A pen communicates with a printer via a radio
									frequency signal whenever it is within range of the printer. Once a pen and printer are registered, they regularly exchange session keys. Whenever the pen transmits digital ink to the
									printer, the digital ink is always encrypted using the appropriate session key. Digital ink is never transmitted in the clear.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_437f13" n="0365">A pen stores a session key for every printer it knows, indexed by printer ID, and a printer stores a session key for every pen it knows, indexed by pen ID. Both have a
									large but finite storage capacity for session keys, and will forget a session key on a least-recently-used basis if necessary.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6ab0ca" n="0366">When a pen comes within range of a printer, the pen and printer discover whether they know each other. If they don't know each other, then the printer determines
									whether it is supposed to know the pen. This might be, for example, because the pen belongs to a user who is registered to use the printer. If the printer is meant to know the pen but
									doesn't, then it initiates the automatic pen registration procedure. If the printer isn't meant to know the pen, then it agrees with the pen to ignore it until the pen is placed in a charging
									cup, at which time it initiates the registration procedure.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ac78cc" n="0367">In addition to its public ID, the pen contains a secret key-exchange key. The key-exchange key is also recorded in the netpage registration server database at time of
									manufacture. During registration, the pen transmits its pen ID to the printer, and the printer transmits the pen ID to the netpage registration server. The server generates a session key for
									the printer and pen to use, and securely transmits the session key to the printer. It also transmits a copy of the session key encrypted with the pen's key-exchange key. The printer stores
									the session key internally, indexed by the pen ID, and transmits the encrypted session key to the pen. The pen stores the session key internally, indexed by the printer ID.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbb1a9" n="0368">Although a fake pen can impersonate a pen in the pen registration protocol, only a real pen can decrypt the session key transmitted by the printer.</p>
								<p xml:id="_00c8c3" n="0369">When a previously unregistered pen is first registered, it is of limited use until it is linked to a user. A registered but &quot;un-owned&quot; pen is only allowed to
									be used to request and fill in netpage user and pen registration forms, to register a new user to which the new pen is automatically linked, or to add a new pen to an existing user.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aded2d" n="0370">The pen uses secret-key rather than public-key encryption because of hardware performance constraints in the pen.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b3884a">3.4 Secure Documents</p>
								<p xml:id="_309d1f" n="0371">The netpage system supports the delivery of secure documents such as tickets and coupons. The netpage printer includes a facility to print watermarks, but will only do
									so on request from publishers who are suitably authorized. The publisher indicates its authority to print watermarks in its certificate, which the printer is able to authenticate.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_42a976" n="0372">The &quot;watermark&quot; printing process uses an alternative dither matrix in specified &quot;watermark&quot; regions of the page. Back-to-back pages contain
									mirror-image watermark regions which coincide when printed. The dither matrices used in odd and even pages' watermark regions are designed to produce an interference effect when the regions
									are viewed together, achieved by looking through the printed sheet.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f77b5" n="0373">The effect is similar to a watermark in that it is not visible when looking at only one side of the page, and is lost when the page is copied by normal means.</p>
								<p xml:id="_751db9" n="0374">Pages of secure documents cannot be copied using the built-in netpage copy mechanism described in Section 1.9 above. This extends to copying netpages on netpage-aware
									photocopiers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aacd95" n="0375">Secure documents are typically generated as part of e-commerce transactions. They can therefore include the user's photograph which was captured when the user
									registered biometric information with the netpage registration server, as described in Section 2.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2babaf" n="0376">When presented with a secure netpage document, the recipient can verify its authenticity by requesting its status in the usual way. The unique ID of a secure document
									is only valid for the lifetime of the document, and secure document IDs are allocated non-contiguously to prevent their prediction by opportunistic forgers. A secure document verification pen
									can be developed with built-in feedback on verification failure, to support easy point-of-presentation document verification.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_781be1" n="0377">Clearly neither the watermark nor the user's photograph are secure in a cryptographic sense. They simply provide a significant obstacle to casual forgery. Online
									document verification, particularly using a verification pen, provides an added level of security where it is needed, but is still not entirely immune to forgeries.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3c755">3.5 Non-Repudiation</p>
								<p xml:id="_9a52f7" n="0378">In the netpage system, forms submitted by users are delivered reliably to forms handlers and are persistently archived on netpage page servers. It is therefore
									impossible for recipients to repudiate delivery.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef4877" n="0379">E-commerce payments made through the system, as described in Section 4, are also impossible for the payee to repudiate.</p>
								<p xml:id="_4547f2">4 Electronic Commerce Model</p>
								<p xml:id="_97497f">4.1 Secure Electronic Transaction (SET)</p>
								<p xml:id="_b57fbd" n="0380">The netpage system uses the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) system as one of its payment systems. SET, having been developed by MasterCard and Visa, is organized
									around payment cards, and this is reflected in the terminology. However, much of the system is independent of the type of accounts being used.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_602f7d" n="0381">In SET, cardholders and merchants register with a certificate authority and are issued with certificates containing their public signature keys. The certificate
									authority verifies a cardholder's registration details with the card issuer as appropriate, and verifies a merchant's registration details with the acquirer as appropriate. Cardholders and
									merchants store their respective private signature keys securely on their computers. During the payment process, these certificates are used to mutually authenticate a merchant and
									cardholder, and to authenticate them both to the payment gateway.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_33f4a2" n="0382">SET has not yet been adopted widely, partly because cardholder maintenance of keys and certificates is considered burdensome. Interim solutions which maintain
									cardholder keys and certificates on a server and give the cardholder access via a password have met with some success.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e63d1b">4.2 Set Payments</p>
								<p xml:id="_d72dd6" n="0383">In the netpage system the netpage registration server acts as a proxy for the netpage user (i.e. the cardholder) in SET payment transactions.</p>
								<p xml:id="_32b39e" n="0384">The netpage system uses biometrics to authenticate the user and authorize SET payments. Because the system is pen-based, the biometric used is the user's on-line
									signature, consisting of time-varying pen position and pressure. A fingerprint biometric can also be used by designing a fingerprint sensor into the pen, although at a higher cost. The type
									of biometric used only affects the capture of the biometric, not the authorization aspects of the system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_da1d61" n="0385">The first step to being able to make SET payments is to register the user's biometric with the netpage registration server. This is done in a controlled environment,
									for example a bank, where the biometric can be captured at the same time as the user's identity is verified. The biometric is captured and stored in the registration database, linked to the
									user's record. The user's photograph is also optionally captured and linked to the record. The SET cardholder registration process is completed, and the resulting private signature key and
									certificate are stored in the database. The user's payment card information is also stored, giving the netpage registration server enough information to act as the user's proxy in any SET
									payment transaction.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a372ac" n="0386">When the user eventually supplies the biometric to complete a payment, for example by signing a netpage order form, the printer securely transmits the order
									information, the pen ID and the biometric data to the netpage registration server. The server verifies the biometric with respect to the user identified by the pen ID, and from then on acts
									as the user's proxy in completing the SET payment transaction.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3e7c95">4.3 Micro-Payments</p>
								<p xml:id="_89891f" n="0387">The netpage system includes a mechanism for micro-payments, to allow the user to be conveniently charged for printing low-cost documents on demand and for copying
									copyright documents, and possibly also to allow the user to be reimbursed for expenses incurred in printing advertising material. The latter depends on the level of subsidy already provided
									to the user.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_35e682" n="0388">When the user registers for e-commerce, a network account is established which aggregates micro-payments. The user receives a statement on a regular basis, and can
									settle any outstanding debit balance using the standard payment mechanism.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3851a2" n="0389">The network account can be extended to aggregate subscription fees for periodicals, which would also otherwise be presented to the user in the form of individual
									statements.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fc894b">4.4 Transactions</p>
								<p xml:id="_0a2ab3" n="0390">When a user requests a netpage in a particular application context, the application is able to embed a user-specific transaction ID 55 in the page. Subsequent input
									through the page is tagged with the transaction ID, and the application is thereby able to establish an appropriate context for the user's input.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_754f91" n="0391">When input occurs through a page which is not user-specific, however, the application must use the user's unique identity to establish a context. A typical example
									involves adding items from a pre-printed catalog page to the user's virtual &quot;shopping cart&quot;. To protect the user's privacy, however, the unique user ID 60 known to the netpage
									system is not divulged to applications. This is to prevent different application providers from easily correlating independently accumulated behavioral data.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3c7431" n="0392">The netpage registration server instead maintains an anonymous relationship between a user and an application via a unique alias ID 65, as shown in FIG. 24. Whenever
									the user activates a hyperlink tagged with the &quot;registered&quot; attribute, the netpage page server asks the netpage registration server to translate the associated application ID 64,
									together with the pen ID 61, into an alias ID 65. The alias ID is then submitted to the hyperlink's application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b9a1cf" n="0393">The application maintains state information indexed by alias ID, and is able to retrieve user-specific state information without knowledge of the global identity of the
									user.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d64184" n="0394">The system also maintains an independent certificate and private signature key for each of a user's applications, to allow it to sign application transactions on behalf
									of the user using only application-specific information.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9e8896" n="0395">To assist the system in routing product bar code (UPC) &quot;hyperlink&quot; activations, the system records a favorite application on behalf of the user for any number
									of product types.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d20d81" n="0396">Each application is associated with an application provider, and the system maintains an account on behalf of each application provider, to allow it to credit and debit
									the provider for click-through fees etc.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b06aae" n="0397">An application provider can be a publisher of periodical subscribed content. The system records the user's willingness to receive the subscribed publication, as well as
									the expected frequency of publication.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_711aaa">4.5 Resource Descriptions and Copyright</p>
								<p xml:id="_45c8bd" n="0398">A preferred embodiment of a resource description class diagram is shown in FIG. 40.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a1e3fa" n="0399">Each document and content object may be described by one or more resource descriptions 842. Resource descriptions use the Dublin Core metadata element set, which is
									designed to facilitate discovery of electronic resources. Dublin Core metadata conforms to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Resource Description Framework (RDF).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c6cdbc" n="0400">A resource description may identify rights holders 920. The netpage system automatically transfers copyright fees from users to rights holders when users print
									copyright content.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e3918c">5 Communications Protocols</p>
								<p xml:id="_6a966a" n="0401">A communications protocol defines an ordered exchange of messages between entities. In the netpage system, entities such as pens, printers and servers utilise a set of
									defined protocols to cooperatively handle user interaction with the netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e89ea9" n="0402">Each protocol is illustrated by way of a sequence diagram in which the horizontal dimension is used to represent message flow and the vertical dimension is used to
									represent time. Each entity is represented by a rectangle containing the name of the entity and a vertical column representing the lifeline of the entity. During the time an entity exists,
									the lifeline is shown as a dashed line. During the time an entity is active, the lifeline is shown as a double line. Because the protocols considered here do not create or destroy entities,
									lifelines are generally cut short as soon as an entity ceases to participate in a protocol.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_45a9cf">5.1 Subscription Delivery Protocol</p>
								<p xml:id="_352772" n="0403">A preferred embodiment of a subscription delivery protocol is shown in FIG. 43.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b5852d" n="0404">A large number of users may subscribe to a periodical publication. Each user's edition may be laid out differently, but many users' editions will share common content
									such as text objects and image objects. The subscription delivery protocol therefore delivers document structures to individual printers via pointcast, but delivers shared content objects via
									multicast.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4fdfb2" n="0405">The application (i.e. publisher) first obtains a document ID 51 for each document from an ID server 12. It then sends each document structure, including its document ID
									and page descriptions, to the page server 10 responsible for the document's newly allocated ID. It includes its own application ID 64, the subscriber's alias ID 65, and the relevant set of
									multicast channel names. It signs the message using its private signature key.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_60b1eb" n="0406">The page server uses the application ID and alias ID to obtain from the registration server the corresponding user ID 60, the user's selected printer ID 62 (which may
									be explicitly selected for the application, or may be the user's default printer), and the application's certificate.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_55776f" n="0407">The application's certificate allows the page server to verify the message signature. The page server's request to the registration server fails if the application ID
									and alias ID don't together identify a subscription 808.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_cec10c" n="0408">The page server then allocates document and page instance IDs and forwards the page descriptions, including page IDs 50, to the printer. It includes the relevant set of
									multicast channel names for the printer to listen to.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9e932c" n="0409">It then returns the newly allocated page IDs to the application for future reference.</p>
								<p xml:id="_fa14e6" n="0410">Once the application has distributed all of the document structures to the subscribers' selected printers via the relevant page servers, it multicasts the various
									subsets of the shared objects on the previously selected multicast channels. Both page servers and printers monitor the appropriate multicast channels and receive their required content
									objects. They are then able to populate the previously pointcast document structures. This allows the page servers to add complete documents to their databases, and it allows the printers to
									print the documents.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7fe3c7">5.2 Hyperlink Activation Protocol</p>
								<p xml:id="_8c56b5" n="0411">A preferred embodiment of a hyperlink activation protocol is shown in FIG. 45.</p>
								<p xml:id="_2187a4" n="0412">When a user clicks on a netpage with a netpage pen, the pen communicates the click to the nearest netpage printer 601. The click identifies the page and a location on

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a851c3" n="0413">The printer determines, via the DNS, the network address of the page server 10a handling the particular page ID 50. The address may already be in its cache if the user

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_dca92c" n="0414">The page server loads the page description 5 identified by the page ID and determines which input element's zone 58, if any, the click lies in. Assuming the relevant

									server hosting the application 71.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0a83be" n="0415">The page server uses the pen ID 61 to obtain the corresponding user ID 60 from the registration server 11, and then allocates a globally unique hyperlink request ID 52
									and builds a hyperlink request 934. The hyperlink request class diagram is shown in FIG. 44. The hyperlink request records the IDs of the requesting user and printer, and identifies the
									clicked hyperlink instance 862. The page server then sends its own server ID 53, the hyperlink request ID, and the link ID to the application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d09947" n="0416">The application produces a response document according to application-specific logic, and obtains a document ID 51 from an ID server 12. It then sends the document to

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f2b3ee" n="0417">The second page server sends the hyperlink request ID and application ID to the first page server to obtain the corresponding user ID and printer ID 62. The first page

									registration server identifies the user corresponding to the pen, and uses the user's dynamic signature biometric 818 to verify the strokes as the user's signature. Once it has verified the
									signature, the registration server uses the application ID 64 and user ID 60 to identify the user's application-specific private signature key. It then uses the key to generate a digital
									signature of the form data, and returns the digital signature to the requesting page server. The page server assigns the digital signature to the signature field and sets the associated

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b9553b" n="0458">The provision of the accelerometers enables this embodiment of the pen 101 to sense motion without reference to surface location tags, allowing the location tags to be
									sampled at a lower rate. Each location tag ID can then identify an object of interest rather than a position on the surface. For example, if the object is a user interface input element (e.g.
									a command button), then the tag ID of each location tag within the area of the input element can directly identify the input element.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ab283c" n="0459">The acceleration measured by the accelerometers in each of the x and y directions is integrated with respect to time to produce an instantaneous velocity and position.

									simultaneously, in full color and with full bleed.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b5acfa" n="0462">An integral binding assembly 605 applies a strip of glue along one edge of each printed sheet, allowing it to adhere to the previous sheet when pressed against it. This
									creates a final bound document 618 which can range in thickness from one sheet to several hundred sheets.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_211a84" n="0463">The replaceable ink cartridge 627, shown in FIG. 13 coupled with the duplexed print engines, has bladders or chambers for storing fixative, adhesive, and cyan, magenta,
									yellow, black and infrared inks. The cartridge also contains a micro air filter in a base molding. The micro air filter interfaces with an air pump 638 inside the printer via a hose 639. This
									provides filtered air to the printheads to prevent ingress of micro particles into the Memjet(TM) printheads 350 which might otherwise clog the printhead nozzles. By incorporating the air
									filter within the cartridge, the operational life of the filter is effectively linked to the life of the cartridge. The ink cartridge is a fully recyclable product with a capacity for
									printing and gluing 3000 pages (1500 sheets).

									The paper 604is drawn into the first print engine 602 by integral, powered pick-up rollers 626. The position and size of the paper 604 is sensed and full bleed printing commences. Fixative is
									printed simultaneously to aid drying in the shortest possible time.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1aba14" n="0465">The paper exits the first Memjet(TM) print engine 602 through a set of powered exit spike wheels (aligned along the straight paper path), which act against a rubberized

									low-speed serial bus 773, and controlling the stepper motors 675, 676.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_06eadc" n="0488">In the 8[1/2]'' versions of the netpage printer, the two print engines each prints 30 Letter pages per minute along the long dimension of the page (11''), giving a line
									rate of 8.8 kHz at 1600 dpi. In the 12'' versions of the netpage printer, the two print engines each prints 45 Letter pages per minute along the short dimension of the page (8[1/2]''), giving
									a line rate of 10.2 kHz. These line rates are well within the operating frequency of the Memjet(TM) printhead, which in the current design exceeds 30 kHz.

								<p xml:id="_1de07c">8 Netpage Greeting Cards</p>
								<p xml:id="_b5e28e" n="0489">The netpage system provides an application whereby a user can create a customised greeting card by selecting an image and a greeting message, and adding a handwritten
									message. The card can be sent to the recipient either directly to their default netpage printer, or to their postal address.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_29565f" n="0490">A user can select a greeting card from an on-line catalogue, add a handwritten message, and dispatch it via the netpage network. Cards can be addressed to other netpage
									users, and to normal postal addresses. In the latter case the card is printed at the service centre closest to the recipient, automatically placed in an envelope, and mailed through the local
									mail system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bae99f" n="0491">Netpage users can choose to receive cards from anyone, or only from authorised friends.</p>
								<p xml:id="_ee165f">8.1 Application Diagram Notation</p>
								<p xml:id="_6ad290" n="0492">Each application user interface flow is illustrated as a collection of documents linked by command arrows. A command arrow indicates that the target document is printed
									as a result of the user pressing the corresponding command button on the source page. Some command arrows are labelled with multiple commands separated by slashes ('/'s), indicating that any
									one of the specified commands causes the target document to be printed. Although multiple commands may label the same command arrow, they typically have different side-effects.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdbea7" n="0493">In application terms, it is important to distinguish between netpage documents and netpage forms. Documents contain printed information, as well as command buttons
									which can be pressed by the user to request further information or some other action. Forms, in addition to behaving like normal documents, also contain input fields which can be filled in by
									the user. They provide the system with a data input mechanism. It is also useful to distinguish between documents which contain generic information and documents which contain information
									specific to a particular interaction between the user and an application. Generic documents may be pre-printed publications such as magazines sold at news stands or advertising posters
									encountered in public places. Forms may also be pre-printed, including, for example, subscription forms encountered in pre-printed publications. They may, of course, also be generated
									on-the-fly by a netpage printer in response to user requests. User-specific documents and forms are normally generated on the fly by a netpage printer in response to user requests. FIG. 48
									shows a generic document 990, a generic form 991, a user-specific document 992, and a user-specific form 993.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e403d1" n="0494">Netpages which participate in a user interface flow are further described by abstract page layouts. A page layout may contain various kinds of elements, each of which
									has a unique style to differentiate it from the others. As shown in FIG. 49, these include fixed information 994, variable information 995, input fields 996, command buttons 997, and
									draggable commands 998.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f986c3" n="0495">When a user interface flow is broken up into multiple diagrams, any document which is duplicated is shown with dashed outlines in all but the main diagram which defines
									it.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2ea954">8.2 Greeting Cards Object Model</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a790c" n="0496">The greeting cards object model revolves around a greeting card supplier, customers and customised greeting cards. The Greeting Cards class diagram 500 is shown in FIG.
									50.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_47a122" n="0497">Each supplier 501 has a unique identifier and a name 501a. Each customer 502 is related to a particular supplier, and has an identifier 503 which is unique within the
									scope of the particular supplier.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_39f47a" n="0498">Each customer 502 represents a particular netpage user 800 to the supplier. A netpage user, on the other hand, can be the customer of any number of suppliers.</p>
								<p xml:id="_10aaf6" n="0499">The name and description of a customer 502 derive by default from the details of the corresponding netpage user 800.</p>
								<p xml:id="_abf375" n="0500">Each supplier 501 has a number of categories 505 of greeting cards. Each category has a number of card images 525 and a number of card messages 507.</p>
								<p xml:id="_110df7" n="0501">A customer 502 can create a customised card 508. Each customised card has a unique identifier 509, the date and time the card was created, the custom message
									handwritten by the user (stored as digital ink), and a fee. Each customised card has a recipient 510. If the recipient is another netpage user, the card is delivered directly to their default
									netpage printer. If the recipient is not a netpage user, the customer specifies the name and postal address for delivery of the card. The Card Recipient class diagram 511 is shown in FIG. 52.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5964bc" n="0502">Each customer 502 has an account 512 with the supplier 501, with a running balance 513. Account payments 547 are associated directly with the customer account. The
									payments class diagram 514 is shown in FIG. 51. Each customer has a history of payment methods 515 with the supplier. The set of payment methods 516 to 519 supported by a particular supplier
									will be specific to that supplier, and may be different for different customers depending on their credit ratings etc.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b3353c" n="0503">When the netpage account payment method 516 is used, the user's netpage account 820 is debited, and the transaction appears on the user's netpage account statement.</p>
								<p xml:id="_74259f" n="0504">When the customer account payment method 517 is used, the user is invoiced for payment.</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3216e" n="0505">When the SET payment method 519 is used, the corresponding SET payment card 821 linked to the user is used to make payment according to the normal SET protocol.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a9c087" n="0506">When the payment card payment method 518 is used, the specified payment card is used to make payment according to the normal protocol between the provider and their
									acquiring bank or institution which handles the particular payment card type.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0e0291" n="0507">Each payment has a unique payment number, the date and time of the payment, the amount paid, and a receipt number.</p>
								<p xml:id="_9dfc53" n="0508">Netpage users may receive cards from anyone, or only from authorized friends, depending on their netpage e-mail settings. If the user's e-mail privacy setting is such
									that e-mails may only be received from members of their contact list, then greeting cards may also only be received from members of the same contact list.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4b1bb7">8.3 Greeting Cards User Interface</p>
								<p xml:id="_4d1694" n="0509">The user may obtain the Netpage Greeting Cards main page 522 from a variety of links including:</p>
								<p xml:id="_131877" n="0510">the netpage directory</p>
								<p xml:id="_08eeea" n="0511">the netpage user's own bookmark</p>
								<p xml:id="_2bc02f" n="0512">an advertisement</p>
								<p xml:id="_fe9e16" n="0513">The Netpage Greeting Card user interface flow is shown in FIG. 53, where it can be seen that the user is also able to access card images 525, account 512 details and
									register with the supplier at 523.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_52d93c">8.3.1 Registering</p>
								<p xml:id="_142509" n="0514">The user can register with the greeting card supplier by clicking on the &lt;Register&gt; button 524 on the Greeting Card main page 522, shown in FIG. 56. A User
									Registration form (not shown) is printed. When a user registers, an account is created for the user and the user is then permitted to create and send customized greeting cards.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_eaf912">8.3.2 Creating a Customised Greeting Card</p>
								<p xml:id="_636759" n="0515">The Greeting Card main page 522, shown in FIG. 56, shows the greeting card categories 505. The user clicks on the desired category. If the user is registered with the
									greeting card supplier the Card Image List 525 is printed, as shown in FIG. 57. If the user is not already registered with the supplier a User Registration form is printed.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_524d6a" n="0516">The Card Image list shows thumbnails 526 of the available images for the front page of the customized greeting card. Only two double-sided pages are printed at a time.
									Each time the user clicks &lt;More&gt; 527 another two double-sided pages of thumbnail images are printed. The user selects an image by clicking on it. The Greeting Card Messages page 528 is
									printed as shown in FIG. 58.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2cae9d" n="0517">The Greeting Card Messages page 528 shows the stock messages available for inclusion on the inside page of the customized greeting card. Only two double-sided pages are
									printed at a time. Each time the user clicks &lt;More&gt; 529 another two double-sided pages of card messages are printed. The user selects a message by clicking on it. The Personal Message
									page 530 is printed as shown in FIG. 59.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2deaf4" n="0518">The Personal Message page allows the user to enter a handwritten message 531 on the inside page of the card, along with the stock card message 532. The user can click
									&lt;Preview Card&gt; 533 to print a sample of the card 534 as it will appear to the recipient, as shown in FIGS. 63 and 64. The user clicks &lt;Continue&gt; 535 and the Recipient Address form
									536 is printed, as shown in FIG. 11.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_43e762" n="0519">The Recipient Address form 536 shows the image 525 and messages 531, 532 for the customized greeting card.</p>
								<p xml:id="_11d856" n="0520">If the recipient 510 is a netpage user, the user enters one or more of the recipient's first name, initials, nickname, and family name. If the recipient is not a
									netpage user then the user enters the recipient's name and postal address in the fields provided. The name and address are printed on an envelope as is (i.e. &quot;handwritten&quot;). The
									user clicks &lt;Continue&gt; 537.</p>
								<p xml:id="_dd557f" n="0521">If the recipient is a netpage user the system first looks for matches in the user's contact list. If a single match is found in the user's contact list then the Pay and
									Send form 541 is printed, with the recipient details shown.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c74f5a" n="0522">If there are no matches with the user's contact list then the global user directory is searched, and the results printed on one or more User Directory Matches pages.
									The user selects the desired recipient by pressing the &lt;Select&gt; button next to the required user name.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a5aafe" n="0523">If there is more than one match with the user's contact list then the Contact List page 538 is printed, as shown in FIG. 61. The user selects the desired recipient 510
									by pressing the &lt;Select&gt; button 539 next to the required user name. If the desired recipient does not appear in the contact list the user presses the &lt;User Directory&gt; button 540
									to automatically search the global user directory for matches. The matching entries are printed on one or more User Directory Matches (not shown) pages. The user selects the desired recipient
									by pressing the &lt;Select&gt; button next to the required user name.</p>
								<p xml:id="_eadf6b" n="0524">Once a single netpage user has been selected as the recipient a Pay and Send form 541 is printed, as shown in FIG. 62.</p>
								<p xml:id="_d6400e" n="0525">The Pay and Send form 541 shows all details of the customized greeting card 508 and shows the fee 542 for delivery of the card. The user signs the form and clicks
									&lt;Send Card&gt; 543. The fee is added to the user's customer account balance 513, and the card is sent to the recipient.</p>
								<p xml:id="_e59702" n="0526">If the recipient is a netpage user the card is printed directly to their default netpage printer. If the recipient is not a netpage user then the country and city are
									extracted from the recipient address. The envelope and card are printed at the country and city specific service center and mailed through the local mail system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2f6d16" n="0527">The Compose Greeting Card function is a multi-page transaction. To assist the user in keeping track of the pages relevant to a single greeting card, the transaction
									number and the current date and time are printed at the top of each page. The user can click a &lt;Reset Form&gt; button at the bottom of any page to void the current form and print a fresh
									form as part of the current transaction.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fc1947" n="0528">The user interface flow 544 for creating and sending a customized greeting card is shown in FIG. 54. The user interface flow 545 for addressing a card is shown in FIG.
									55.

								<p xml:id="_65348a">BACKGROUND</p>
								<p xml:id="_77bf76" n="0006">Paper is widely used to display and record information. Printed information is easier to read than information displayed on a computer screen. Hand-drawing and
									handwriting afford greater richness of expression than input via a computer keyboard and mouse. Moreover, paper doesn't run on batteries, can be read in bright light, more robustly accepts
									coffee spills, and is portable and disposable.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_968fa0" n="0007">Online publication has many advantages over traditional paper-based publication. From a consumer's point of view, information is available on demand, information can be
									navigated via hypertext links, searched and automatically personalized.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0ac795" n="0008">From the publisher's point of view, the costs of printing and physical distribution are eliminated, and the publication becomes more attractive to the advertisers who
									pay for it because it can be targeted to specific demographics and linked to product sites.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d9c9ce" n="0009">Online publication also has disadvantages. Computer screens are inferior to paper. At the same quality as a magazine page, an SVGA computer screen displays only about a
									fifth as much information. Both CRTs and LCDs have brightness and contrast problems, particularly when ambient light is strong, while ink on paper, being reflective rather than emissive, is
									both bright and sharp in ambient light.

								<p xml:id="_1a08b0" n="0102">Note: Memjet(TM) is a trade mark of Silverbrook Research Pty Ltd, Australia.</p>
								<p xml:id="_15a829" n="0103">In the preferred embodiment, the invention is configured to work with the netpage networked computer system, a detailed overview of which follows. It will be
									appreciated that not every implementation will necessarily embody all or even most of the specific details and extensions discussed below in relation to the basic system. However, the system
									is described in its most complete form to reduce the need for external reference when attempting to understand the context in which the preferred embodiments and aspects of the present
									invention operate.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d7b593" n="0104">In brief summary, the preferred form of the netpage system employs a computer interface in the form of a mapped surface, that is, a physical surface which contains
									references to a map of the surface maintained in a computer system. The map references can be queried by an appropriate sensing device. Depending upon the specific implementation, the map
									references may be encoded visibly or invisibly, and defined in such a way that a local query on the mapped surface yields an unambiguous map reference both within the map and among different
									maps. The computer system can contain information about features on the mapped surface, and such information can be retrieved based on map references supplied by a sensing device used with
									the mapped surface. The information thus retrieved can take the form of actions which are initiated by the computer system on behalf of the operator in response to the operator's interaction
									with the surface features.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1709a2" n="0105">In its preferred form, the netpage system relies on the production of, and human interaction with, netpages. These are pages of text, graphics and images printed on
									ordinary paper, but which work like interactive web pages. Information is encoded on each page using ink which is substantially invisible to the unaided human eye. The ink, however, and
									thereby the coded data, can be sensed by an optically imaging pen and transmitted to the netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f8217" n="0106">In the preferred form, active buttons and hyperlinks on each page can be clicked with the pen to request information from the network or to signal preferences to a
									network server. In one embodiment, text written by hand on a netpage is automatically recognized and converted to computer text in the netpage system, allowing forms to be filled in. In other
									embodiments, signatures recorded on a netpage are automatically verified, allowing e-commerce transactions to be securely authorized.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0c3540" n="0107">As illustrated in FIG. 1, a printed netpage 1 can represent a interactive form which can be filled in by the user both physically, on the printed page, and
									&quot;electronically&quot;, via communication between the pen and the netpage system. The example shows a &quot;Request&quot; form containing name and address fields and a submit button. The
									netpage consists of graphic data 2 printed using visible ink, and coded data 3 printed as a collection of tags 4 using invisible ink. The corresponding page description 5, stored on the
									netpage network, describes the individual elements of the netpage. In particular it describes the type and spatial extent (zone) of each interactive element (i.e. text field or button in the
									example), to allow the netpage system to correctly interpret input via the netpage. The submit button 6, for example, has a zone 7 which corresponds to the spatial extent of the corresponding
									graphic 8.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4b690e" n="0108">As illustrated in FIG. 2, the netpage pen 101, a preferred form of which is shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 and described in more detail below, works in conjunction with a
									netpage printer 601, an Internet-connected printing appliance for home, office or mobile use. The pen is wireless and communicates securely with the netpage printer via a short-range radio
									link 9.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7d3801" n="0109">The netpage printer 601, a preferred form of which is shown in FIGS. 11 to 13 and described in more detail below, is able to deliver, periodically or on demand,
									personalized newspapers, magazines, catalogs, greeting cards and other publications, all printed at high quality as interactive netpages. Unlike a personal computer, the netpage printer is an
									appliance which can be, for example, wall-mounted adjacent to an area where the morning news is first consumed, such as in a user's kitchen, near a breakfast table, or near the household's
									point of departure for the day. It also comes in tabletop, desktop, portable and miniature versions.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_62a805" n="0110">Netpages printed at their point of consumption combine the ease-of-use of paper with the timeliness and interactivity of an interactive medium.</p>
								<p xml:id="_44d96c" n="0111">As shown in FIG. 2, the netpage pen 101 interacts with the coded data on a printed netpage 1 and communicates, via a short-range radio link 9, the interaction to a
									netpage printer. The printer 601 sends the interaction to the relevant netpage page server 10 for interpretation. In appropriate circumstances, the page server sends a corresponding message
									to application computer software running on a netpage application server 13. The application server may in turn send a response which is printed on the originating printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d68ffb" n="0112">The netpage system is made considerably more convenient in the preferred embodiment by being used in conjunction with high-speed microelectromechanical system (MEMS)
									based inkjet (Memjet(TM)) printers. In the preferred form of this technology, relatively high-speed and high-quality printing is made more affordable to consumers. In its preferred form, a
									netpage publication has the physical characteristics of a traditional newsmagazine, such as a set of letter-size glossy pages printed in full color on both sides, bound together for easy
									navigation and comfortable handling.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7574e0" n="0113">The netpage printer exploits the growing availability of broadband Internet access. Cable service is available to 95% of households in the United States, and cable
									modem service offering broadband Internet access is already available to 20% of these. The netpage printer can also operate with slower connections, but with longer delivery times and lower
									image quality. Indeed, the netpage system can be enabled using existing consumer inkjet and laser printers, although the system will operate more slowly and will therefore be less acceptable
									from a consumer's point of view. In other embodiments, the netpage system is hosted on a private intranet. In still other embodiments, the netpage system is hosted on a single computer or
									computer-enabled device, such as a printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbdc6f" n="0114">Netpage publication servers 14 on the netpage network are configured to deliver print-quality publications to netpage printers. Periodical publications are delivered
									automatically to subscribing netpage printers via pointcasting and multicasting Internet protocols. Personalized publications are filtered and formatted according to individual user profiles.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c1de77" n="0115">A netpage printer can be configured to support any number of pens, and a pen can work with any number of netpage printers. In the preferred implementation, each netpage
									pen has a unique identifier. A household may have a collection of colored netpage pens, one assigned to each member of the family. This allows each user to maintain a distinct profile with
									respect to a netpage publication server or application server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_478f3f" n="0116">A netpage pen can also be registered with a netpage registration server 11 and linked to one or more payment card accounts. This allows e-commerce payments to be
									securely authorized using the netpage pen. The netpage registration server compares the signature captured by the netpage pen with a previously registered signature, allowing it to
									authenticate the user's identity to an e-commerce server. Other biometrics can also be used to verify identity. A version of the netpage pen includes fingerprint scanning, verified in a
									similar way by the netpage registration server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4617cb" n="0117">Although a netpage printer may deliver periodicals such as the morning newspaper without user intervention, it can be configured never to deliver unsolicited junk mail.
									In its preferred form, it only delivers periodicals from subscribed or otherwise authorized sources. In this respect, the netpage printer is unlike a fax machine or e-mail account which is
									visible to any junk mailer who knows the telephone number or email address.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_75e850">1 Netpage System Architecture</p>
								<p xml:id="_d269d9" n="0118">Each object model in the system is described using a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram. A class diagram consists of a set of object classes connected by
									relationships, and two kinds of relationships are of interest here: associations and generalizations. An association represents some kind of relationship between objects, i.e. between
									instances of classes. A generalization relates actual classes, and can be understood in the following way: if a class is thought of as the set of all objects of that class, and class A is a
									generalization of class B, then B is simply a subset of A. The UML does not directly support second-order modelling-i.e. classes of classes.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fcc8c4" n="0119">Each class is drawn as a rectangle labelled with the name of the class. It contains a list of the attributes of the class, separated from the name by a horizontal line,
									and a list of the operations of the class, separated from the attribute list by a horizontal line. In the class diagrams which follow, however, operations are never modelled.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_930450" n="0120">An association is drawn as a line joining two classes, optionally labelled at either end with the multiplicity of the association. The default multiplicity is one. An
									asterisk (*) indicates a multiplicity of &quot;many&quot;, i.e. zero or more. Each association is optionally labelled with its name, and is also optionally labelled at either end with the
									role of the corresponding class. An open diamond indicates an aggregation association (&quot;is-part-of&quot;), and is drawn at the aggregator end of the association line.</p>
								<p xml:id="_65d51d" n="0121">A generalization relationship (&quot;is-a&quot;) is drawn as a solid line joining two classes, with an arrow (in the form of an open triangle) at the generalization
									end.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9a7424" n="0122">When a class diagram is broken up into multiple diagrams, any class which is duplicated is shown with a dashed outline in all but the main diagram which defines it. It
									is shown with attributes only where it is defined.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a08e0">1.1 Netpages</p>
								<p xml:id="_81174a" n="0123">Netpages are the foundation on which a netpage network is built. They provide a paper-based user interface to published information and interactive services.</p>
								<p xml:id="_94b170" n="0124">A netpage consists of a printed page (or other surface region) invisibly tagged with references to an online description of the page. The online page description is
									maintained persistently by a netpage page server. The page description describes the visible layout and content of the page, including text, graphics and images. It also describes the input
									elements on the page, including buttons, hyperlinks, and input fields. A netpage allows markings made with a netpage pen on its surface to be simultaneously captured and processed by the
									netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b6bc7b" n="0125">Multiple netpages can share the same page description. However, to allow input through otherwise identical pages to be distinguished, each netpage is assigned a unique
									page identifier. This page ID has sufficient precision to distinguish between a very large number of netpages.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5634bd" n="0126">Each reference to the page description is encoded in a printed tag. The tag identifies the unique page on which it appears, and thereby indirectly identifies the page
									description. The tag also identifies its own position on the page. Characteristics of the tags are described in more detail below.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_8caa37" n="0127">Tags are printed in infrared-absorptive ink on any substrate which is infrared-reflective, such as ordinary paper. Near-infrared wavelengths are invisible to the human
									eye but are easily sensed by a solid-state image sensor with an appropriate filter.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_27362c" n="0128">A tag is sensed by an area image sensor in the netpage pen, and the tag data is transmitted to the netpage system via the nearest netpage printer. The pen is wireless
									and communicates with the netpage printer via a short-range radio link. Tags are sufficiently small and densely arranged that the pen can reliably image at least one tag even on a single
									click on the page. It is important that the pen recognize the page ID and position on every interaction with the page, since the interaction is stateless. Tags are error-correctably encoded
									to make them partially tolerant to surface damage.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_972a8e" n="0129">The netpage page server maintains a unique page instance for each printed netpage, allowing it to maintain a distinct set of user-supplied values for input fields in
									the page description for each printed netpage.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c68ff4" n="0130">The relationship between the page description, the page instance, and the printed netpage is shown in FIG. 4. The page instance is associated with both the netpage
									printer which printed it and, if known, the netpage user who requested it.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f4c7d7">1.2 Netpage Tags</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbf070">1.2.1 Tag Data Content</p>
								<p xml:id="_a44ff8" n="0131">In a preferred form, each tag identifies the region in which it appears, and the location of that tag within the region. A tag may also contain flags which relate to
									the region as a whole or to the tag. One or more flag bits may, for example, signal a tag sensing device to provide feedback indicative of a function associated with the immediate area of the
									tag, without the sensing device having to refer to a description of the region. A netpage pen may, for example, illuminate an &quot;active area&quot; LED when in the zone of a hyperlink.</p>
								<p xml:id="_25fa3a" n="0132">As will be more clearly explained below, in a preferred embodiment, each tag contains an easily recognized invariant structure which aids initial detection, and which
									assists in minimizing the effect of any warp induced by the surface or by the sensing process. The tags preferably tile the entire page, and are sufficiently small and densely arranged that
									the pen can reliably image at least one tag even on a single click on the page. It is important that the pen recognize the page ID and position on every interaction with the page, since the
									interaction is stateless.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c5c2c2" n="0133">
									In a preferred embodiment, the region to which a tag refers coincides with an entire page, and the region ID encoded in the tag is therefore synonomous with the page ID of the page on which
									the tag appears. In other embodiments, the region to which a tag refers can be an arbitrary subregion of a page or other surface. For example, it can coincide with the zone of an interactive
									element, in which case the region ID can directly identify the interactive element.

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_976706" n="0134">Each tag contains 120 bits of information, typically allocated as shown in Table 1. Assuming a maximum tag density of 64 per square inch, a 16-bit tag ID supports a
									region size of up to 1024 square inches. Larger regions can be mapped continuously without increasing the tag ID precision simply by using abutting regions and maps. The 100-bit region ID
									allows 2&lt;100 &gt; (10&lt;30 &gt; or a million trillion trillion) different regions to be uniquely identified.</p>
								<p xml:id="_2600b9">1.2.2 Tag Data Encoding</p>
								<p xml:id="_e12e82" n="0135">The 120 bits of tag data are redundantly encoded using a (15, 5) Reed-Solomon code. This yields 360 encoded bits consisting of 6 codewords of 15 4-bit symbols each. The
									(15, 5) code allows up to 5 symbol errors to be corrected per codeword, i.e. it is tolerant of a symbol error rate of up to 33% per codeword.</p>
								<p xml:id="_f58fe6" n="0136">Each 4-bit symbol is represented in a spatially coherent way in the tag, and the symbols of the six codewords are interleaved spatially within the tag. This ensures
									that a burst error (an error affecting multiple spatially adjacent bits) damages a minimum number of symbols overall and a minimum number of symbols in any one codeword, thus maximising the
									likelihood that the burst error can be fully corrected.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d28cd0">1.2.3 Physical Tag Structure</p>
								<p xml:id="_f3859a" n="0137">The physical representation of the tag, shown in FIG. 5, includes fixed target structures 15, 16, 17 and variable data areas 18. The fixed target structures allow a
									sensing device such as the netpage pen to detect the tag and infer its three-dimensional orientation relative to the sensor. The data areas contain representations of the individual bits of
									the encoded tag data.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f78258" n="0138">To achieve proper tag reproduction, the tag is rendered at a resolution of 256*256 dots. When printed at 1600 dots per inch this yields a tag with a diameter of about 4
									mm. At this resolution the tag is designed to be surrounded by a &quot;quiet area&quot; of radius 16 dots. Since the quiet area is also contributed by adjacent tags, it only adds 16 dots to
									the effective diameter of the tag.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3530a4" n="0139">The tag includes six target structures. A detection ring 15 allows the sensing device to initially detect the tag. The ring is easy to detect because it is rotationally
									invariant and because a simple correction of its aspect ratio removes most of the effects of perspective distortion. An orientation axis 16 allows the sensing device to determine the
									approximate planar orientation of the tag due to the yaw of the sensor. The orientation axis is skewed to yield a unique orientation. Four perspective targets 17 allow the sensing device to
									infer an accurate two-dimensional perspective transform of the tag and hence an accurate three-dimensional position and orientation of the tag relative to the sensor.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_42fc4f" n="0140">All target structures are redundantly large to improve their immunity to noise.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0f502a" n="0141">The overall tag shape is circular. This supports, amongst other things, optimal tag packing on an irregular triangular grid. In combination with the circular detection
									ring, this makes a circular arrangement of data bits within the tag optimal. To maximise its size, each data bit is represented by a radial wedge in the form of an area bounded by two radial
									lines and two concentric circular arcs. Each wedge has a minimum dimension of 8 dots at 1600 dpi and is designed so that its base (its inner arc), is at least equal to this minimum dimension.
									The height of the wedge in the radial direction is always equal to the minimum dimension. Each 4-bit data symbol is represented by an array of 2*2 wedges.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_48ab70" n="0142">The 15 4-bit data symbols of each of the six codewords are allocated to the four concentric symbol rings 18a to 18d in interleaved fashion. Symbols are allocated
									alternately in circular progression around the tag.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3eaec5" n="0143">The interleaving is designed to maximise the average spatial distance between any two symbols of the same codeword.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a4e322" n="0144">In order to support &quot;single-click&quot; interaction with a tagged region via a sensing device, the sensing device must be able to see at least one entire tag in
									its field of view no matter where in the region or at what orientation it is positioned. The required diameter of the field of view of the sensing device is therefore a function of the size
									and spacing of the tags.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a1f9a0" n="0145">Assuming a circular tag shape, the minimum diameter of the sensor field of view is obtained when the tags are tiled on a equilateral triangular grid, as shown in FIG.
									6.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6cfff7">1.2.5 Tag Image Processing and Decoding</p>
								<p xml:id="_e64847" n="0146">The tag image processing and decoding performed by a sensing device such as the netpage pen is shown in FIG. 7. While a captured image is being acquired from the image
									sensor, the dynamic range of the image is determined (at 20). The center of the range is then chosen as the binary threshold for the image 21. The image is then thresholded and segmented into
									connected pixel regions (i.e. shapes 23) (at 22). Shapes which are too small to represent tag target structures are discarded. The size and centroid of each shape is also computed.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_52f6a9" n="0147">Binary shape moments 25 are then computed (at 24) for each shape, and these provide the basis for subsequently locating target structures. Central shape moments are by
									their nature invariant of position, and can be easily made invariant of scale, aspect ratio and rotation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1f4c58" n="0148">The ring target structure 15 is the first to be located (at 26). A ring has the advantage of being very well behaved when perspective-distorted. Matching proceeds by
									aspect-normalizing and rotation-normalizing each shape's moments. Once its second-order moments are normalized the ring is easy to recognize even if the perspective distortion was
									significant. The ring's original aspect and rotation 27 together provide a useful approximation of the perspective transform.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_91d2ca" n="0149">The axis target structure 16 is the next to be located (at 28). Matching proceeds by applying the ring's normalizations to each shape's moments, and
									rotation-normalizing the resulting moments. Once its second-order moments are normalized the axis target is easily recognized. Note that one third order moment is required to disambiguate the
									two possible orientations of the axis. The shape is deliberately skewed to one side to make this possible. Note also that it is only possible to rotation-normalize the axis target after it
									has had the ring's normalizations applied, since the perspective distortion can hide the axis target's axis. The axis target's original rotation provides a useful approximation of the tag's
									rotation due to pen yaw 29.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b02ffc" n="0150">The four perspective target structures 17 are the last to be located (at 30). Good estimates of their positions are computed based on their known spatial relationships
									to the ring and axis targets, the aspect and rotation of the ring, and the rotation of the axis. Matching proceeds by applying the ring's normalizations to each shape's moments. Once their
									second-order moments are normalized the circular perspective targets are easy to recognize, and the target closest to each estimated position is taken as a match. The original centroids of
									the four perspective targets are then taken to be the perspective-distorted corners 31 of a square of known size in tag space, and an eight-degree-of-freedom perspective transform 33 is
									inferred (at 32) based on solving the well-understood equations relating the four tag-space and image-space point pairs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a57fb8" n="0151">The inferred tag-space to image-space perspective transform is used to project (at 36) each known data bit position in tag space into image space where the real-valued
									position is used to bilinearly interpolate (at 36) the four relevant adjacent pixels in the input image. The previously computed image threshold 21 is used to threshold the result to produce
									the final bit value 37.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_94ece3" n="0152">Once all 360 data bits 37 have been obtained in this way, each of the six 60-bit Reed-Solomon codewords is decoded (at 38) to yield 20 decoded bits 39, or 120 decoded
									bits in total. Note that the codeword symbols are sampled in codeword order, so that codewords are implicitly de-interleaved during the sampling process.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7b4194" n="0153">The ring target 15 is only sought in a subarea of the image whose relationship to the image guarantees that the ring, if found, is part of a complete tag. If a complete
									tag is not found and successfully decoded, then no pen position is recorded for the current frame. Given adequate processing power and ideally a non-minimal field of view 193, an alternative
									strategy involves seeking another tag in the current image.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7c1be3" n="0154">The obtained tag data indicates the identity of the region containing the tag and the position of the tag within the region. An accurate position 35 of the pen nib in
									the region, as well as the overall orientation 35 of the pen, is then inferred (at 34) from the perspective transform 33 observed on the tag and the known spatial relationship between the
									pen's physical axis and the pen's optical axis.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d3d0f6">1.2.6 Tag Map</p>
								<p xml:id="_b62d2b" n="0155">Decoding a tag results in a region ID, a tag ID, and a tag-relative pen transform. Before the tag ID and the tag-relative pen location can be translated into an
									absolute location within the tagged region, the location of the tag within the region must be known. This is given by a tag map, a function which maps each tag ID in a tagged region to a
									corresponding location. The tag map class diagram is shown in FIG. 22, as part of the netpage printer class diagram.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a93dcc" n="0156">A tag map reflects the scheme used to tile the surface region with tags, and this can vary according to surface type. When multiple tagged regions share the same tiling
									scheme and the same tag numbering scheme, they can also share the same tag map.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_98e76d" n="0157">The tag map for a region must be retrievable via the region ID. Thus, given a region ID, a tag ID and a pen transform, the tag map can be retrieved, the tag ID can be
									translated into an absolute tag location within the region, and the tag-relative pen location can be added to the tag location to yield an absolute pen location within the region.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d3a358">1.2.7 Tagging Schemes</p>
								<p xml:id="_fdf6d4" n="0158">Two distinct surface coding schemes are of interest, both of which use the tag structure described earlier in this section. The preferred coding scheme uses
									&quot;location-indicating&quot; tags as already discussed. An alternative coding scheme uses object-indicating tags.</p>
								<p xml:id="_51a5ad" n="0159">A location-indicating tag contains a tag ID which, when translated through the tag map associated with the tagged region, yields a unique tag location within the
									region. The tag-relative location of the pen is added to this tag location to yield the location of the pen within the region. This in turn is used to determine the location of the pen
									relative to a user interface element in the page description associated with the region. Not only is the user interface element itself identified, but a location relative to the user
									interface element is identified. Location-indicating tags therefore trivially support the capture of an absolute pen path in the zone of a particular user interface element.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f4c689" n="0160">An object-indicating tag contains a tag ID which directly identifies a user interface element in the page description associated with the region. All the tags in the
									zone of the user interface element identify the user interface element, making them all identical and therefore indistinguishable. Object-indicating tags do not, therefore, support the
									capture of an absolute pen path. They do, however, support the capture of a relative pen path. So long as the position sampling frequency exceeds twice the encountered tag frequency, the
									displacement from one sampled pen position to the next within a stroke can be unambiguously determined.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6c5b5e" n="0161">With either tagging scheme, the tags function in cooperation with associated visual elements on the netpage as user interactive elements in that a user can interact
									with the printed page using an appropriate sensing device in order for tag data to be read by the sensing device and for an appropriate response to be generated in the netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b4ecf6">1.3 Document and Page Descriptions</p>
								<p xml:id="_48642d" n="0162">A preferred embodiment of a document and page description class diagram is shown in FIGS. 25 and 26.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdb489" n="0163">In the netpage system a document is described at three levels. At the most abstract level the document 836 has a hierarchical structure whose terminal elements 839 are
									associated with content objects 840 such as text objects, text style objects, image objects, etc. Once the document is printed on a printer with a particular page size and according to a
									particular user's scale factor preference, the document is paginated and otherwise formatted. Formatted terminal elements 835 will in some cases be associated with content objects which are
									different from those associated with their corresponding terminal elements, particularly where the content objects are style-related. Each printed instance of a document and page is also
									described separately, to allow input captured through a particular page instance 830 to be recorded separately from input captured through other instances of the same page description.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bcbdba" n="0164">The presence of the most abstract document description on the page server allows a user to request a copy of a document without being forced to accept the source
									document's specific format. The user may be requesting a copy through a printer with a different page size, for example. Conversely, the presence of the formatted document description on the
									page server allows the page server to efficiently interpret user actions on a particular printed page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_912ca5" n="0165">A formatted document 834 consists of a set of formatted page descriptions 5, each of which consists of a set of formatted terminal elements 835. Each formatted element
									has a spatial extent or zone 58 on the page. This defines the active area of input elements such as hyperlinks and input fields.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_64ee08" n="0166">A document instance 831 corresponds to a formatted document 834. It consists of a set of page instances 830, each of which corresponds to a page description 5 of the
									formatted document. Each page instance 830 describes a single unique printed netpage 1, and records the page ID 50 of the netpage. A page instance is not part of a document instance if it
									represents a copy of a page requested in isolation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f487a6" n="0167">A page instance consists of a set of terminal element instances 832. An element instance only exists if it records instance-specific information. Thus, a hyperlink
									instance exists for a hyperlink element because it records a transaction ID 55 which is specific to the page instance, and a field instance exists for a field element because it records input
									specific to the page instance. An element instance does not exist, however, for static elements such as textflows.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a3b41f" n="0168">A terminal element can be a static element 843, a hyperlink element 844, a field element 845 or a page server command element 846, as shown in FIG. 27. A static element
									843 can be a style element 847 with an associated style object 854, a textflow element 848 with an associated styled text object 855, an image element 849 with an associated image element
									856, a graphic element 850 with an associated graphic object 857, a video clip element 851 with an associated video clip object 858, an audio clip element 852 with an associated audio clip
									object 859, or a script element 853 with an associated script object 860, as shown in FIG. 28.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2f3fa3" n="0169">A page instance has a background field 833 which is used to record any digital ink captured on the page which does not apply to a specific input element.</p>
								<p xml:id="_3fc7fa" n="0170">In the preferred form of the invention, a tag map 811 is associated with each page instance to allow tags on the page to be translated into locations on the page.</p>
								<p xml:id="_69f129">1.4 The Netpage Network</p>
								<p xml:id="_249bce" n="0171">In a preferred embodiment, a netpage network consists of a distributed set of netpage page servers 10, netpage registration servers 11, netpage ID servers 12, netpage
									application servers 13, netpage publication servers 14, and netpage printers 601 connected via a network 19 such as the Internet, as shown in FIG. 3.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_790974" n="0172">The netpage registration server 11 is a server which records relationships between users, pens, printers, applications and publications, and thereby authorizes various
									network activities. It authenticates users and acts as a signing proxy on behalf of authenticated users in application transactions. It also provides handwriting recognition services. As
									described above, a netpage page server 10 maintains persistent information about page descriptions and page instances. The netpage network includes any number of page servers, each handling a
									subset of page instances. Since a page server also maintains user input values for each page instance, clients such as netpage printers send netpage input directly to the appropriate page
									server. The page server interprets any such input relative to the description of the corresponding page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_edf5ce" n="0173">A netpage ID server 12 allocates document IDs 51 on demand, and provides load-balancing of page servers via its ID allocation scheme.</p>
								<p xml:id="_2a852c" n="0174">A netpage printer uses the Internet Distributed Name System (DNS), or similar, to resolve a netpage page ID 50 into the network address of the netpage page server
									handling the corresponding page instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a0ef5c" n="0175">A netpage application server 13 is a server which hosts interactive netpage applications. A netpage publication server 14 is an application server which publishes
									netpage documents to netpage printers. They are described in detail in Section 2.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_949c58" n="0176">Netpage servers can be hosted on a variety of network server platforms from manufacturers such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun. Multiple netpage servers can run
									concurrently on a single host, and a single server can be distributed over a number of hosts. Some or all of the functionality provided by netpage servers, and in particular the functionality
									provided by the ID server and the page server, can also be provided directly in a netpage appliance such as a netpage printer, in a computer workstation, or on a local network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f7e6a2">1.5 The Netpage Printer</p>
								<p xml:id="_2809c7" n="0177">The netpage printer 601 is an appliance which is registered with the netpage system and prints netpage documents on demand and via subscription. Each printer has a
									unique printer ID 62, and is connected to the netpage network via a network such as the Internet, ideally via a broadband connection.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bd64ff" n="0178">Apart from identity and security settings in non-volatile memory, the netpage printer contains no persistent storage. As far as a user is concerned, &quot;the network
									is the computer&quot;. Netpages function interactively across space and time with the help of the distributed netpage page servers 10, independently of particular netpage printers.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b08b66" n="0179">The netpage printer receives subscribed netpage documents from netpage publication servers 14. Each document is distributed in two parts: the page layouts, and the
									actual text and image objects which populate the pages. Because of personalization, page layouts are typically specific to a particular subscriber and so are pointcast to the subscriber's
									printer via the appropriate page server. Text and image objects, on the other hand, are typically shared with other subscribers, and so are multicast to all subscribers' printers and the
									appropriate page servers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_cfb3ae" n="0180">The netpage publication server optimizes the segmentation of document content into pointcasts and multicasts. After receiving the pointcast of a document's page
									layouts, the printer knows which multicasts, if any, to listen to.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3015f" n="0181">Once the printer has received the complete page layouts and objects that define the document to be printed, it can print the document.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdf74a" n="0182">The printer rasterizes and prints odd and even pages simultaneously on both sides of the sheet. It contains duplexed print engine controllers 760 and print engines
									utilizing Memjet(TM) printheads 350 for this purpose.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4e28fe" n="0183">The printing process consists of two decoupled stages: rasterization of page descriptions, and expansion and printing of page images. The raster image processor (RIP)
									consists of one or more standard DSPs 757 running in parallel. The duplexed print engine controllers consist of custom processors which expand, dither and print page images in real time,
									synchronized with the operation of the printheads in the print engines.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5ab78b" n="0184">Printers not enabled for IR printing have the option to print tags using IR-absorptive black ink, although this restricts tags to otherwise empty areas of the page.
									Although such pages have more limited functionality than IR-printed pages, they are still classed as netpages.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4c7803" n="0185">A normal netpage printer prints netpages on sheets of paper. More specialised netpage printers may print onto more specialised surfaces, such as globes. Each printer
									supports at least one surface type, and supports at least one tag tiling scheme, and hence tag map, for each surface type. The tag map 811 which describes the tag tiling scheme actually used
									to print a document becomes associated with that document so that the document's tags can be correctly interpreted.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_908dcb" n="0186">FIG. 2 shows the netpage printer class diagram, reflecting printer-related information maintained by a registration server 11 on the netpage network.</p>
								<p xml:id="_74433e" n="0187">A preferred embodiment of the netpage printer is described in greater detail in Section 6 below, with reference to FIGS. 11 to 16.</p>
								<p xml:id="_64f05f">1.5.1 Memjet(TM) Printheads</p>
								<p xml:id="_aaa37c" n="0188">The netpage system can operate using printers made with a wide range of digital printing technologies, including thermal inkjet, piezoelectric inkjet, laser
									electrophotographic, and others. However, for wide consumer acceptance, it is desirable that a netpage printer have the following characteristics:
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9c9df3" n="0189">photographic quality color printing</p>
								<p xml:id="_de638c" n="0190">high quality text printing</p>

								<p xml:id="_84b34d" n="0200">low power consumption</p>
								<p xml:id="_3721af" n="0201">No commercially available printing technology has all of these characteristics.</p>
								<p xml:id="_da3a69" n="0202">To enable to production of printers with these characteristics, the present applicant has invented a new print technology, referred to as Memjet(TM) technology.
									Memjet(TM) is a drop-on-demand inkjet technology that incorporates pagewidth printheads fabricated using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. FIG. 17 shows a single printing
									element 300 of a Memjet(TM) printhead. The netpage wallprinter incorporates 168960 printing elements 300 to form a 1600 dpi pagewidth duplex printer. This printer simultaneously prints cyan,
									magenta, yellow, black, and infrared inks as well as paper conditioner and ink fixative.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_dcc13b" n="0203">The printing element 300 is approximately 110 microns long by 32 microns wide. Arrays of these printing elements are formed on a silicon substrate 301 that incorporates
									CMOS logic, data transfer, timing, and drive circuits (not shown).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4edc8c" n="0204">Major elements of the printing element 300 are the nozzle 302, the nozzle rim 303, the nozzle chamber 304, the fluidic seal 305, the ink channel rim 306, the lever arm
									307, the active actuator beam pair 308, the passive actuator beam pair 309, the active actuator anchor 310, the passive actuator anchor 311, and the ink inlet 312.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5bc951" n="0205">The active actuator beam pair 308 is mechanically joined to the passive actuator beam pair 309 at the join 319. Both beams pairs are anchored at their respective anchor
									points 310 and 311. The combination of elements 308, 309, 310, 311, and 319 form a cantilevered electrothermal bend actuator 320.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9cee8e" n="0206">FIG. 18 shows a small part of an array of printing elements 300, including a cross section 315 of a printing element 300. The cross section 315 is shown without ink, to
									clearly show the ink inlet 312 that passes through the silicon wafer 301.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ba5627" n="0207">FIGS. 19(a), 19(b) and 19(c) show the operating cycle of a Memjet(TM) printing element 300.</p>
								<p xml:id="_ac1f17" n="0208">FIG. 19(a) shows the quiescent position of the ink meniscus 316 prior to printing an ink droplet. Ink is retained in the nozzle chamber by surface tension at the ink
									meniscus 316 and at the fluidic seal 305 formed between the nozzle chamber 304 and the ink channel rim 306.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_321381" n="0209">While printing, the printhead CMOS circuitry distributes data from the print engine controller to the correct printing element, latches the data, and buffers the data
									to drive the electrodes 318 of the active actuator beam pair 308. This causes an electrical current to pass through the beam pair 308 for about one microsecond, resulting in Joule heating.
									The temperature increase resulting from Joule heating causes the beam pair 308 to expand. As the passive actuator beam pair 309 is not heated, it does not expand, resulting in a stress
									difference between the two beam pairs. This stress difference is partially resolved by the cantilevered end of the electrothermal bend actuator 320 bending towards the substrate 301. The
									lever arm 307 transmits this movement to the nozzle chamber 304. The nozzle chamber 304 moves about two microns to the position shown in FIG. 19(b). This increases the ink pressure, forcing
									ink 321 out of the nozzle 302, and causing the ink meniscus 316 to bulge. The nozzle rim 303 prevents the ink meniscus 316 from spreading across the surface of the nozzle chamber 304.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_af9781" n="0210">As the temperature of the beam pairs 308 and 309 equalizes, the actuator 320 returns to its original position. This aids in the break-off of the ink droplet 317 from
									the ink 321 in the nozzle chamber, as shown in FIG. 19(c). The nozzle chamber is refilled by the action of the surface tension at the meniscus 316.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e3d44e" n="0211">FIG. 20 shows a segment of a printhead 350. In a netpage printer, the length of the printhead is the full width of the paper (typically 210 mm) in the direction 351.
									The segment shown is 0.4 mm long (about 0.2% of a complete printhead). When printing, the paper is moved past the fixed printhead in the direction 352. The printhead has 6 rows of
									interdigitated printing elements 300, printing the six colors or types of ink supplied by the ink inlets 312.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_36bf38" n="0212">To protect the fragile surface of the printhead during operation, a nozzle guard wafer 330 is attached to the printhead substrate 301. For each nozzle 302 there is a
									corresponding nozzle guard hole 331 through which the ink droplets are fired. To prevent the nozzle guard holes 331 from becoming blocked by paper fibers or other debris, filtered air is
									pumped through the air inlets 332 and out of the nozzle guard holes during printing. To prevent ink 321 from drying, the nozzle guard is sealed while the printer is idle.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a978a3">1.6 The Netpage Pen</p>
								<p xml:id="_684f09" n="0213">The active sensing device of the netpage system is typically a pen 101, which, using its embedded controller 134, is able to capture and decode IR position tags from a
									page via an image sensor. The image sensor is a solid-state device provided with an appropriate filter to permit sensing at only near-infrared wavelengths. As described in more detail below,
									the system is able to sense when the nib is in contact with the surface, and the pen is able to sense tags at a sufficient rate to capture human handwriting (i.e. at 200 dpi or greater and
									100 Hz or faster). Information captured by the pen is encrypted and wirelessly transmitted to the printer (or base station), the printer or base station interpreting the data with respect to
									the (known) page structure.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_58aba1" n="0214">The preferred embodiment of the netpage pen operates both as a normal marking ink pen and as a non-marking stylus. The marking aspect, however, is not necessary for
									using the netpage system as a browsing system, such as when it is used as an Internet interface. Each netpage pen is registered with the netpage system and has a unique pen ID 61. FIG. 23
									shows the netpage pen class diagram, reflecting pen-related information maintained by a registration server 11 on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b37548" n="0215">When either nib is in contact with a netpage, the pen determines its position and orientation relative to the page. The nib is attached to a force sensor, and the force
									on the nib is interpreted relative to a threshold to indicate whether the pen is &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;. This allows a interactive element on the page to be 'clicked' by pressing
									with the pen nib, in order to request, say, information from a network. Furthermore, the force is captured as a continuous value to allow, say, the full dynamics of a signature to be
									verified.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1b87a8" n="0216">The pen determines the position and orientation of its nib on the netpage by imaging, in the infrared spectrum, an area 193of the page in the vicinity of the nib. It
									decodes the nearest tag and computes the position of the nib relative to the tag from the observed perspective distortion on the imaged tag and the known geometry of the pen optics. Although
									the position resolution of the tag may be low, because the tag density on the page is inversely proportional to the tag size, the adjusted position resolution is quite high, exceeding the
									minimum resolution required for accurate handwriting recognition.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef1a67" n="0217">Pen actions relative to a netpage are captured as a series of strokes. A stroke consists of a sequence of time-stamped pen positions on the page, initiated by a
									pen-down event and completed by the subsequent pen-up event. A stroke is also tagged with the page ID 50 of the netpage whenever the page ID changes, which, under normal circumstances, is at
									the commencement of the stroke.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c5550c" n="0218">Each netpage pen has a current selection 826 associated with it, allowing the user to perform copy and paste operations etc. The selection is timestamped to allow the
									system to discard it after a defined time period. The current selection describes a region of a page instance. It consists of the most recent digital ink stroke captured through the pen
									relative to the background area of the page. It is interpreted in an application-specific manner once it is submitted to an application via a selection hyperlink activation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fb5101" n="0219">Each pen has a current nib 824. This is the nib last notified by the pen to the system. In the case of the default netpage pen described above, either the marking black
									ink nib or the non-marking stylus nib is current. Each pen also has a current nib style 825. This is the nib style last associated with the pen by an application, e.g. in response to the user
									selecting a color from a palette. The default nib style is the nib style associated with the current nib. Strokes captured through a pen are tagged with the current nib style. When the
									strokes are subsequently reproduced, they are reproduced in the nib style with which they are tagged.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_idP" n="0220">Whenever the pen is within range of a printer with which it can communicate, the pen slowly flashes its &quot;online&quot; LED. When the pen fails to decode a stroke
									relative to the page, it momentarily activates its &quot;error&quot; LED. When the pen succeeds in decoding a stroke relative to the page, it momentarily activates its &quot;ok&quot; LED.</p>
								<p xml:id="_014257" n="0221">A sequence of captured strokes is referred to as digital ink. Digital ink forms the basis for the digital exchange of drawings and handwriting, for online recognition
									of handwriting, and for online verification of signatures.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0eaf8f" n="0222">The pen is wireless and transmits digital ink to the netpage printer via a short-range radio link. The transmitted digital ink is encrypted for privacy and security and
									packetized for efficient transmission, but is always flushed on a pen-up event to ensure timely handling in the printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_93dd9e" n="0223">When the pen is out-of-range of a printer it buffers digital ink in internal memory, which has a capacity of over ten minutes of continuous handwriting. When the pen is
									once again within range of a printer, it transfers any buffered digital ink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_355431" n="0224">A pen can be registered with any number of printers, but because all state data resides in netpages both on paper and on the network, it is largely immaterial which
									printer a pen is communicating with at any particular time.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_986091" n="0225">A preferred embodiment of the pen is described in greater detail in Section 6 below, with reference to FIGS. 8 to 10.</p>
								<p xml:id="_82b677">1.7 Netpage Interaction</p>
								<p xml:id="_82b094" n="0226">The netpage printer 601 receives data relating to a stroke from the pen 101 when the pen is used to interact with a netpage 1. The coded data 3 of the tags 4 is read by
									the pen when it is used to execute a movement, such as a stroke. The data allows the identity of the particular page and associated interactive element to be determined and an indication of
									the relative positioning of the pen relative to the page to be obtained. The indicating data is transmitted to the printer, where it resolves, via the DNS, the page ID 50 of the stroke into
									the network address of the netpage page server 10 which maintains the corresponding page instance 830. It then transmits the stroke to the page server. If the page was recently identified in
									an earlier stroke, then the printer may already have the address of the relevant page server in its cache. Each netpage consists of a compact page layout maintained persistently by a netpage
									page server (see below). The page layout refers to objects such as images, fonts and pieces of text, typically stored elsewhere on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e508c2" n="0227">When the page server receives the stroke from the pen, it retrieves the page description to which the stroke applies, and determines which element of the page
									description the stroke intersects. It is then able to interpret the stroke in the context of the type of the relevant element.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3537c4" n="0228">A &quot;click&quot; is a stroke where the distance and time between the pen down position and the subsequent pen up position are both less than some small maximum. An
									object which is activated by a click typically requires a click to be activated, and accordingly, a longer stroke is ignored. The failure of a pen action, such as a &quot;sloppy&quot; click,
									to register is indicated by the lack of response from the pen's &quot;ok&quot; LED.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0c0f0e" n="0229">There are two kinds of input elements in a netpage page description: hyperlinks and form fields. Input through a form field can also trigger the activation of an
									associated hyperlink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c22301">1.7.1 Hyperlinks</p>
								<p xml:id="_c2352b" n="0230">A hyperlink is a means of sending a message to a remote application, and typically elicits a printed response in the netpage system.</p>
								<p xml:id="_d9af7e" n="0231">A hyperlink element 844 identifies the application 71 which handles activation of the hyperlink, a link ID 54 which identifies the hyperlink to the application, an
									&quot;alias required&quot; flag which asks the system to include the user's application alias ID 65 in the hyperlink activation, and a description which is used when the hyperlink is recorded
									as a favorite or appears in the user's history. The hyperlink element class diagram is shown in FIG. 29.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_621612" n="0232">When a hyperlink is activated, the page server sends a request to an application somewhere on the network. The application is identified by an application ID 64, and
									the application ID is resolved in the normal way via the DNS. There are three types of hyperlinks: general hyperlinks 863, form hyperlinks 865, and selection hyperlinks 864, as shown in FIG.
									30. A general hyperlink can implement a request for a linked document, or may simply signal a preference to a server. A form hyperlink submits the corresponding form to the application. A
									selection hyperlink submits the current selection to the application. If the current selection contains a single-word piece of text, for example, the application may return a single-page
									document giving the word's meaning within the context in which it appears, or a translation into a different language. Each hyperlink type is characterized by what information is submitted to
									the application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_de6e28" n="0233">The corresponding hyperlink instance 862 records a transaction ID 55 which can be specific to the page instance on which the hyperlink instance appears. The transaction
									ID can identify user-specific data to the application, for example a &quot;shopping cart&quot; of pending purchases maintained by a purchasing application on behalf of the user.</p>
								<p xml:id="_3ad090" n="0234">The system includes the pen's current selection 826 in a selection hyperlink activation. The system includes the content of the associated form instance 868 in a form
									hyperlink activation, although if the hyperlink has its &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute set, only input since the last form submission is included. The system includes an effective return
									path in all hyperlink activations.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_050424" n="0235">A hyperlinked group 866 is a group element 838 which has an associated hyperlink, as shown in FIG. 31. When input occurs through any field element in the group, the
									hyperlink 844 associated with the group is activated. A hyperlinked group can be used to associate hyperlink behavior with a field such as a checkbox. It can also be used, in conjunction with
									the &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute of a form hyperlink, to provide continuous input to an application. It can therefore be used to support a &quot;blackboard&quot; interaction model, i.e.
									where input is captured and therefore shared as soon as it occurs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_444c19">1.7.2 Forms</p>
								<p xml:id="_09c48e" n="0236">A form defines a collection of related input fields used to capture a related set of inputs through a printed netpage. A form allows a user to submit one or more
									parameters to an application software program running on a server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_19d361" n="0237">A form 867 is a group element 838 in the document hierarchy. It ultimately contains a set of terminal field elements 839. A form instance 868 represents a printed
									instance of a form. It consists of a set of field instances 870 which correspond to the field elements 845 of the form. Each field instance has an associated value 871, whose type depends on
									the type of the corresponding field element. Each field value records input through a particular printed form instance, i.e. through one or more printed netpages. The form class diagram is
									shown in FIG. 32.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_220200" n="0238">Each form instance has a status 872 which indicates whether the form is active, frozen, submitted, void or expired. A form is active when first printed. A form becomes
									frozen once it is signed. A form becomes submitted once one of its submission hyperlinks has been activated, unless the hyperlink has its &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute set. A form
									becomes void when the user invokes a void form, reset form or duplicate form page command. A form expires when the time the form has been active exceeds the form's specified lifetime. While
									the form is active, form input is allowed. Input through a form which is not active is instead captured in the background field 833 of the relevant page instance. When the form is active or
									frozen, form submission is allowed. Any attempt to submit a form when the form is not active or frozen is rejected, and instead elicits an form status report.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a1292" n="0239">Each form instance is associated (at 59) with any form instances derived from it, thus providing a version history. This allows all but the latest version of a form in
									a particular time period to be excluded from a search.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d65d72" n="0240">All input is captured as digital ink. Digital ink 873 consists of a set of timestamped stroke groups 874, each of which consists of a set of styled strokes 875. Each
									stroke consists of a set of timestamped pen positions 876, each of which also includes pen orientation and nib force. The digital ink class diagram is shown in FIG. 33.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdee2f" n="0241">A field element 845 can be a checkbox field 877, a text field 878, a drawing field 879, or a signature field 880. The field element class diagram is shown in FIG. 34.
									Any digital ink captured in a field's zone 58 is assigned to the field.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef2dad" n="0242">A checkbox field has an associated boolean value 881, as shown in FIG. 35. Any mark (a tick, a cross, a stroke, a fill zigzag, etc.) captured in a checkbox field's zone
									causes a true value to be assigned to the field's value.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d19e45" n="0243">A text field has an associated text value 882, as shown in FIG. 36. Any digital ink captured in a text field's zone is automatically converted to text via online
									handwriting recognition, and the text is assigned to the field's value. Online handwriting recognition is well-understood (see for example Tappert, C., C. Y. Suen and T. Wakahara, &quot;The
									State of the Art in On-Line Handwriting Recognition&quot;, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 12, No. 8, August 1990).</p>
								<p xml:id="_be4a8f" n="0244">A signature field has an associated digital signature value 883, as shown in FIG. 37. Any digital ink captured in a signature field's zone is automatically verified
									with respect to the identity of the owner of the pen, and a digital signature of the content of the form of which the field is part is generated and assigned to the field's value. The digital
									signature is generated using the pen user's private signature key specific to the application which owns the form. Online signature verification is well-understood (see for example Plamondon,
									R. and G. Lorette, &quot;Automatic Signature Verification and Writer Identification-The State of the Art&quot;, Pattern Recognition, Vol. 22, No. 2, 1989).</p>
								<p xml:id="_d88b12" n="0245">A field element is hidden if its &quot;hidden&quot; attribute is set. A hidden field element does not have an input zone on a page and does not accept input. It can
									have an associated field value which is included in the form data when the form containing the field is submitted.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c4e519" n="0246">&quot;Editing&quot; commands, such as strike-throughs indicating deletion, can also be recognized in form fields.</p>
								<p xml:id="_c6456f" n="0247">Because the handwriting recognition algorithm works &quot;online&quot; (i.e. with access to the dynamics of the pen movement), rather than &quot;offline&quot; (i.e.
									with access only to a bitmap of pen markings), it can recognize run-on discretely-written characters with relatively high accuracy, without a writer-dependent training phase. A
									writer-dependent model of handwriting is automatically generated over time, however, and can be generated up-front if necessary,
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ae0bb7" n="0248">Digital ink, as already stated, consists of a sequence of strokes. Any stroke which starts in a particular element's zone is appended to that element's digital ink
									stream, ready for interpretation. Any stroke not appended to an object's digital ink stream is appended to the background field's digital ink stream.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_62ea2e" n="0249">Digital ink captured in the background field is interpreted as a selection gesture. Circumscription of one or more objects is generally interpreted as a selection of
									the circumscribed objects, although the actual interpretation is application-specific.

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_461fe9" n="0252">The raw digital ink captured in every field is retained on the netpage page server and is optionally transmitted with the form data when the form is submitted to the
									application. This allows the application to interrogate the raw digital ink should it suspect the original conversion, such as the conversion of handwritten text. This can, for example,
									involve human intervention at the application level for forms which fail certain application-specific consistency checks. As an extension to this, the entire background area of a form can be
									designated as a drawing field. The application can then decide, on the basis of the presence of digital ink outside the explicit fields of the form, to route the form to a human operator, on
									the assumption that the user may have indicated amendments to the filled-in fields outside of those fields.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9850ad" n="0253">FIG. 38 shows a flowchart of the process of handling pen input relative to a netpage. The process consists of receiving (at 884) a stroke from the pen; identifying (at
									885) the page instance 830 to which the page ID 50 in the stroke refers; retrieving (at 886) the page description 5; identifying (at 887) a formatted element 839 whose zone 58 the stroke
									intersects; determining (at 888) whether the formatted element corresponds to a field element, and if so appending (at 892) the received stroke to the digital ink of the field value 871,
									interpreting (at 893) the accumulated digital ink of the field, and determining (at 894) whether the field is part of a hyperlinked group 866 and if so activating (at 895) the associated
									hyperlink; alternatively determining (at 889) whether the formatted element corresponds to a hyperlink element and if so activating (at 895) the corresponding hyperlink; alternatively, in the
									absence of an input field or hyperlink, appending (at 890) the received stroke to the digital ink of the background field 833; and copying (at 891) the received stroke to the current
									selection 826 of the current pen, as maintained by the registration server.

								<p xml:id="_fce065" n="0254">FIG. 38a shows a detailed flowchart of step 893 in the process shown in FIG. 38, where the accumulated digital ink of a field is interpreted according to the type of
									the field. The process consists of determining (at 896) whether the field is a checkbox and (at 897) whether the digital ink represents a checkmark, and if so assigning (at 898) a true value
									to the field value; alternatively determining (at 899) whether the field is a text field and if so converting (at 900) the digital ink to computer text, with the help of the appropriate
									registration server, and assigning (at 901) the converted computer text to the field value; alternatively determining (at 902) whether the field is a signature field and if so verifying (at
									903) the digital ink as the signature of the pen's owner, with the help of the appropriate registration server, creating (at 904) a digital signature of the contents of the corresponding
									form, also with the help of the registration server and using the pen owner's private signature key relating to the corresponding application, and assigning (at 905) the digital signature to

								<p xml:id="_eba98a">1.7.3 Page Server Commands</p>
								<p xml:id="_a73a04" n="0255">A page server command is a command which is handled locally by the page server. It operates directly on form, page and document instances.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bc0b68" n="0256">A page server command 907 can be a void form command 908, a duplicate form command 909, a reset form command 910, a get form status command 911, a duplicate page
									command 912, a reset page command 913, a get page status command 914, a duplicate document command 915, a reset document command 916, or a get document status command 917, as shown in FIG.
									39.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_16a8fc" n="0257">A void form command voids the corresponding form instance. A duplicate form command voids the corresponding form instance and then produces an active printed copy of
									the current form instance with field values preserved. The copy contains the same hyperlink transaction IDs as the original, and so is indistinguishable from the original to an application. A
									reset form command voids the corresponding form instance and then produces an active printed copy of the form instance with field values discarded. A get form status command produces a
									printed report on the status of the corresponding form instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the form status of the form instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_59e27a" n="0258">Since a form hyperlink instance contains a transaction ID, the application has to be involved in producing a new form instance. A button requesting a new form instance
									is therefore typically implemented as a hyperlink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7c20e9" n="0259">A duplicate page command produces a printed copy of the corresponding page instance with the background field value preserved. If the page contains a form or is part of
									a form, then the duplicate page command is interpreted as a duplicate form command. A reset page command produces a printed copy of the corresponding page instance with the background field
									value discarded. If the page contains a form or is part of a form, then the reset page command is interpreted as a reset form command. A get page status command produces a printed report on
									the status of the corresponding page instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the status of any forms it contains or is part of.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f4659b" n="0260">The netpage logo which appears on every netpage is usually associated with a duplicate page element.</p>
								<p xml:id="_1d8f0e" n="0261">When a page instance is duplicated with field values preserved, field values are printed in their native form, i.e. a checkmark appears as a standard checkmark graphic,
									and text appears as typeset text. Only drawings and signatures appear in their original form, with a signature accompanied by a standard graphic indicating successful signature verification.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_896c70" n="0262">A duplicate document command produces a printed copy of the corresponding document instance with background field values preserved. If the document contains any forms,
									then the duplicate document command duplicates the forms in the same way a duplicate form command does. A reset document command produces a printed copy of the corresponding document instance
									with background field values discarded. If the document contains any forms, then the reset document command resets the forms in the same way a reset form command does. A get document status
									command produces a printed report on the status of the corresponding document instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the status of any forms
									it contains.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0ebce0" n="0263">If the page server command's &quot;on selected&quot; attribute is set, then the command operates on the page identified by the pen's current selection rather than on
									the page containing the command. This allows a menu of page server commands to be printed. If the target page doesn't contain a page server command element for the designated page server
									command, then the command is ignored.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_66c0d8" n="0264">An application can provide application-specific handling by embedding the relevant page server command element in a hyperlinked group. The page server activates the
									hyperlink associated with the hyperlinked group rather than executing the page server command.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c9cb3f" n="0265">A page server command element is hidden if its &quot;hidden&quot; attribute is set. A hidden command element does not have an input zone on a page and so cannot be
									activated directly by a user. It can, however, be activated via a page server command embedded in a different page, if that page server command has its &quot;on selected&quot; attribute set.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f228a6">1.8 Standard Features of Netpages</p>
								<p xml:id="_cdf0dc" n="0266">In the preferred form, each netpage is printed with the netpage logo at the bottom to indicate that it is a netpage and therefore has interactive properties. The logo
									also acts as a copy button. In most cases pressing the logo produces a copy of the page. In the case of a form, the button produces a copy of the entire form. And in the case of a secure
									document, such as a ticket or coupon, the button elicits an explanatory note or advertising page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1e47cf" n="0267">The default single-page copy function is handled directly by the relevant netpage page server. Special copy functions are handled by linking the logo button to an
									application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9f1c5c">1.9 User Help System</p>
								<p xml:id="_5da2f9" n="0268">In a preferred embodiment, the netpage printer has a single button labelled &quot;Help&quot;. When pressed it elicits a single page of information, including:</p>

								<p xml:id="_0807ff" n="0279">A document function is initiated by simply pressing the button and then touching any page of the document. The status of a document indicates who published it and when,
									to whom it was delivered, and to whom and when it was subsequently submitted as a form.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b44807" n="0280">The netpage network directory allows the user to navigate the hierarchy of publications and services on the network. As an alternative, the user can call the netpage
									network &quot;900&quot; number &quot;yellow pages&quot; and speak to a human operator. The operator can locate the desired document and route it to the user's printer. Depending on the
									document type, the publisher or the user pays the small &quot;yellow pages&quot; service fee.</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a7bad" n="0281">The help page is obviously unavailable if the printer is unable to print. In this case the &quot;error&quot; light is lit and the user can request remote diagnosis over

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d62616">2 Personalized Publication Model</p>
								<p xml:id="_af575a" n="0282">In the following description, news is used as a canonical publication example to illustrate personalization mechanisms in the netpage system. Although news is often
									used in the limited sense of newspaper and newsmagazine news, the intended scope in the present context is wider.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_77e429" n="0283">In the netpage system, the editorial content and the advertising content of a news publication are personalized using different mechanisms. The editorial content is
									personalized according to the reader's explicitly stated and implicitly captured interest profile. The advertising content is personalized according to the reader's locality and demographic.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_654b2a">2.1 Editorial Personalization</p>
								<p xml:id="_fe217d" n="0284">A subscriber can draw on two kinds of news sources: those that deliver news publications, and those that deliver news streams. While news publications are aggregated
									and edited by the publisher, news streams are aggregated either by a news publisher or by a specialized news aggregator. News publications typically correspond to traditional newspapers and
									newsmagazines, while news streams can be many and varied: a &quot;raw&quot; news feed from a news service, a cartoon strip, a freelance writer's column, a friend's bulletin board, or the
									reader's own e-mail.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_630e53" n="0285">The netpage publication server supports the publication of edited news publications as well as the aggregation of multiple news streams. By handling the aggregation and
									hence the formatting of news streams selected directly by the reader, the server is able to place advertising on pages over which it otherwise has no editorial control.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1592d2" n="0286">The subscriber builds a daily newspaper by selecting one or more contributing news publications, and creating a personalized version of each. The resulting daily
									editions are printed and bound together into a single newspaper. The various members of a household typically express their different interests and tastes by selecting different daily
									publications and then customizing them.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aecce0" n="0287">For each publication, the reader optionally selects specific sections. Some sections appear daily, while others appear weekly. The daily sections available from The New
									York Times online, for example, include &quot;Page One Plus&quot;, &quot;National&quot;, &quot;International&quot;, &quot;Opinion&quot;, &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Arts/Living&quot;,
									&quot;Technology&quot;, and &quot;Sports&quot;. The set of available sections is specific to a publication, as is the default subset.</p>
								<p xml:id="_051aca" n="0288">The reader can extend the daily newspaper by creating custom sections, each one drawing on any number of news streams. Custom sections might be created for e-mail and
									friends' announcements (&quot;Personal&quot;), or for monitoring news feeds for specific topics (&quot;Alerts&quot; or &quot;Clippings&quot;).</p>
								<p xml:id="_92c533" n="0289">For each section, the reader optionally specifies its size, either qualitatively (e.g. short, medium, or long), or numerically (i.e. as a limit on its number of pages),
									and the desired proportion of advertising, either qualitatively (e.g. high, normal, low, none), or numerically (i.e. as a percentage).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_becd46" n="0290">The reader also optionally expresses a preference for a large number of shorter articles or a small number of longer articles. Each article is ideally written (or
									edited) in both short and long forms to support this preference.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_14698a" n="0291">An article may also be written (or edited) in different versions to match the expected sophistication of the reader, for example to provide children's and adults'
									versions. The appropriate version is selected according to the reader's age. The reader can specify a &quot;reading age&quot; which takes precedence over their biological age.</p>
								<p xml:id="_98e608" n="0292">The articles which make up each section are selected and prioritized by the editors, and each is assigned a useful lifetime. By default they are delivered to all
									relevant subscribers, in priority order, subject to space constraints in the subscribers' editions.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f5a9f6" n="0293">In sections where it is appropriate, the reader may optionally enable collaborative filtering. This is then applied to articles which have a sufficiently long lifetime.
									Each article which qualifies for collaborative filtering is printed with rating buttons at the end of the article. The buttons can provide an easy choice (e.g. &quot;liked&quot; and
									&quot;disliked&quot;), making it more likely that readers will bother to rate the article.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b171b9" n="0294">Articles with high priorities and short lifetimes are therefore effectively considered essential reading by the editors and are delivered to most relevant subscribers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1bc0ef" n="0295">The reader optionally specifies a serendipity factor, either qualitatively (e.g. do or don't surprise me), or numerically. A high serendipity factor lowers the
									threshold used for matching during collaborative filtering. A high factor makes it more likely that the corresponding section will be filled to the reader's specified capacity. A different
									serendipity factor can be specified for different days of the week.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d4fe85" n="0296">The reader also optionally specifies topics of particular interest within a section, and this modifies the priorities assigned by the editors.</p>
								<p xml:id="_430936" n="0297">The speed of the reader's Internet connection affects the quality at which images can be delivered. The reader optionally specifies a preference for fewer images or
									smaller images or both. If the number or size of images is not reduced, then images may be delivered at lower quality (i.e. at lower resolution or with greater compression).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d65e25" n="0298">At a global level, the reader specifies how quantities, dates, times and monetary values are localized. This involves specifying whether units are imperial or metric, a
									local timezone and time format, and a local currency, and whether the localization consist of in situ translation or annotation. These preferences are derived from the reader's locality by
									default.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fede65" n="0299">To reduce reading difficulties caused by poor eyesight, the reader optionally specifies a global preference for a larger presentation. Both text and images are scaled
									accordingly, and less information is accommodated on each page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a51deb" n="0300">The language in which a news publication is published, and its corresponding text encoding, is a property of the publication and not a preference expressed by the user.
									However, the netpage system can be configured to provide automatic translation services in various guises.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d24b52">2.2 Advertising Localization and Targeting</p>
								<p xml:id="_5448c6" n="0301">The personalization of the editorial content directly affects the advertising content, because advertising is typically placed to exploit the editorial context. Travel
									ads, for example, are more likely to appear in a travel section than elsewhere. The value of the editorial content to an advertiser (and therefore to the publisher) lies in its ability to
									attract large numbers of readers with the right demographics.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ceadcc" n="0302">Effective advertising is placed on the basis of locality and demographics. Locality determines proximity to particular services, retailers etc., and particular
									interests and concerns associated with the local community and environment. Demographics determine general interests and preoccupations as well as likely spending patterns.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f1a62a" n="0303">A news publisher's most profitable product is advertising &quot;space&quot;, a multi-dimensional entity determined by the publication's geographic coverage, the size of
									its readership, its readership demographics, and the page area available for advertising.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3ab7ba" n="0304">In the netpage system, the netpage publication server computes the approximate multi-dimensional size of a publication's saleable advertising space on a per-section
									basis, taking into account the publication's geographic coverage, the section's readership, the size of each reader's section edition, each reader's advertising proportion, and each reader's
									demographic.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_865bf3" n="0305">In comparison with other media, the netpage system allows the advertising space to be defined in greater detail, and allows smaller pieces of it to be sold separately.
									It therefore allows it to be sold at closer to its true value.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f59bb5" n="0306">For example, the same advertising &quot;slot&quot; can be sold in varying proportions to several advertisers, with individual readers' pages randomly receiving the
									advertisement of one advertiser or another, overall preserving the proportion of space sold to each advertiser.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_11b57f" n="0307">The netpage system allows advertising to be linked directly to detailed product information and online purchasing. It therefore raises the intrinsic value of the
									advertising space.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbc07b" n="0308">Because personalization and localization are handled automatically by netpage publication servers, an advertising aggregator can provide arbitrarily broad coverage of
									both geography and demographics. The subsequent disaggregation is efficient because it is automatic. This makes it more cost-effective for publishers to deal with advertising aggregators than
									to directly capture advertising. Even though the advertising aggregator is taking a proportion of advertising revenue, publishers may find the change profit-neutral because of the greater
									efficiency of aggregation. The advertising aggregator acts as an intermediary between advertisers and publishers, and may place the same advertisement in multiple publications.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9ef994" n="0309">It is worth noting that ad placement in a netpage publication can be more complex than ad placement in the publication's traditional counterpart, because the
									publication's advertising space is more complex. While ignoring the full complexities of negotiations between advertisers, advertising aggregators and publishers, the preferred form of the
									netpage system provides some automated support for these negotiations, including support for automated auctions of advertising space. Automation is particularly desirable for the placement of
									advertisements which generate small amounts of income, such as small or highly localized advertisements.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ed91b3" n="0310">Once placement has been negotiated, the aggregator captures and edits the advertisement and records it on a netpage ad server. Correspondingly, the publisher records
									the ad placement on the relevant netpage publication server. When the netpage publication server lays out each user's personalized publication, it picks the relevant advertisements from the
									netpage ad server.

								<p xml:id="_dcf36d">2.3.1 Information Filtering</p>
								<p xml:id="_3a8999" n="0311">The personalization of news and other publications relies on an assortment of user-specific profile information, including:</p>
								<p xml:id="_78c0ea" n="0312">publication customizations</p>
								<p xml:id="_b529c2" n="0313">collaborative filtering vectors</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f5aee" n="0314">contact details</p>
								<p xml:id="_edd7e4" n="0315">presentation preferences</p>
								<p xml:id="_0adfd4" n="0316">The customization of a publication is typically publication-specific, and so the customization information is maintained by the relevant netpage publication server.</p>
								<p xml:id="_fcbd92" n="0317">A collaborative filtering vector consists of the user's ratings of a number of news items. It is used to correlate different users' interests for the purposes of making
									recommendations. Although there are benefits to maintaining a single collaborative filtering vector independently of any particular publication, there are two reasons why it is more practical
									to maintain a separate vector for each publication: there is likely to be more overlap between the vectors of subscribers to the same publication than between those of subscribers to
									different publications; and a publication is likely to want to present its users' collaborative filtering vectors as part of the value of its brand, not to be found elsewhere. Collaborative
									filtering vectors are therefore also maintained by the relevant netpage publication server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4c7536" n="0318">Contact details, including name, street address, ZIP Code, state, country, telephone numbers, are global by nature, and are maintained by a netpage registration server.

								<p xml:id="_ec69e0" n="0319">Presentation preferences, including those for quantities, dates and times, are likewise global and maintained in the same way.</p>
								<p xml:id="_f1bf81" n="0320">The localization of advertising relies on the locality indicated in the user's contact details, while the targeting of advertising relies on personal information such
									as date of birth, gender, marital status, income, profession, education, or qualitative derivatives such as age range and income range.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5f5edc" n="0321">For those users who choose to reveal personal information for advertising purposes, the information is maintained by the relevant netpage registration server. In the
									absence of such information, advertising can be targeted on the basis of the demographic associated with the user's ZIP or ZIP+4 Code.

								<p xml:id="_e4cc66" n="0322">Each user, pen, printer, application provider and application is assigned its own unique identifier, and the netpage registration server maintains the relationships
									between them, as shown in FIGS. 21, 22, 23 and 24. For registration purposes, a publisher is a special kind of application provider, and a publication is a special kind of application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_92e641" n="0323">Each user 800 may be authorized to use any number of printers 802, and each printer may allow any number of users to use it. Each user has a single default printer (at
									66), to which periodical publications are delivered by default, whilst pages printed on demand are delivered to the printer through which the user is interacting. The server keeps track of
									which publishers a user has authorized to print to the user's default printer. A publisher does not record the ID of any particular printer, but instead resolves the ID when it is required.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4c5140" n="0324">When a user subscribes 808 to a publication 807, the publisher 806 (i.e. application provider 803) is authorized to print to a specified printer or the user's default
									printer. This authorization can be revoked at any time by the user. Each user may have several pens 801, but a pen is specific to a single user. If a user is authorized to use a particular
									printer, then that printer recognizes any of the user's pens.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_70db8b" n="0325">The pen ID is used to locate the corresponding user profile maintained by a particular netpage registration server, via the DNS in the usual way.</p>
								<p xml:id="_aba516" n="0326">A Web terminal 809 can be authorized to print on a particular netpage printer, allowing Web pages and netpage documents encountered during Web browsing to be

								<p xml:id="_6486ba" n="0327">The netpage system can collect, on behalf of a printer provider, fees and commissions on income earned through publications printed on the provider's printers. Such

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ec5919" n="0328">Each user also has a netpage account 820 which is used to accumulate micro-debits and credits (such as those described in the preceding paragraph); contact details 815,

								<p xml:id="_09a75f">2.4 Intelligent Page Layout</p>
								<p xml:id="_76f517" n="0331">The netpage publication server automatically lays out the pages of each user's personalized publication on a section-by-section basis. Since most advertisements are in
									the form of pre-formatted rectangles, they are placed on the page before the editorial content.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0260b6" n="0332">The advertising ratio for a section can be achieved with wildly varying advertising ratios on individual pages within the section, and the ad layout algorithm exploits
									this. The algorithm is configured to attempt to co-locate closely tied editorial and advertising content, such as placing ads for roofing material specifically within the publication because
									of a special feature on do-it-yourself roofing repairs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0017eb" n="0333">The editorial content selected for the user, including text and associated images and graphics, is then laid out according to various aesthetic rules.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a374c1" n="0334">The entire process, including the selection of ads and the selection of editorial content, must be iterated once the layout has converged, to attempt to more closely
									achieve the user's stated section size preference. The section size preference can, however, be matched on average over time, allowing significant day-to-day variations.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0db30b">2.5 Document Format</p>
								<p xml:id="_f8e58a" n="0335">Once the document is laid out, it is encoded for efficient distribution and persistent storage on the netpage network.</p>
								<p xml:id="_fd2c88" n="0336">The primary efficiency mechanism is the separation of information specific to a single user's edition and information shared between multiple users' editions. The
									specific information consists of the page layout. The shared information consists of the objects to which the page layout refers, including images, graphics, and pieces of text.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b9becf" n="0337">A text object contains fully-formatted text represented in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) using the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). XSL provides precise
									control over text formatting independently of the region into which the text is being set, which in this case is being provided by the layout. The text object contains embedded language codes
									to enable automatic translation, and embedded hyphenation hints to aid with paragraph formatting.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_788564" n="0338">An image object encodes an image in the JPEG 2000 wavelet-based compressed image format. A graphic object encodes a 2D graphic in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.

								<p xml:id="_9d4aad">2.6 Document Distribution</p>
								<p xml:id="_c99a91" n="0340">As described above, for purposes of efficient distribution and persistent storage on the netpage network, a user-specific page layout is separated from the shared
									objects to which it refers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_756bee" n="0341">When a subscribed publication is ready to be distributed, the netpage publication server allocates, with the help of the netpage ID server 12, a unique ID for each
									page, page instance, document, and document instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bee7a6" n="0342">The server computes a set of optimized subsets of the shared content and creates a multicast channel for each subset, and then tags each user-specific layout with the
									names of the multicast channels which will carry the shared content used by that layout. The server then pointcasts each user's layouts to that user's printer via the appropriate page server,
									and when the pointcasting is complete, multicasts the shared content on the specified channels. After receiving its pointcast, each page server and printer subscribes to the multicast
									channels specified in the page layouts. During the multicasts, each page server and printer extracts from the multicast streams those objects referred to by its page layouts. The page servers
									persistently archive the received page layouts and shared content.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b33be1" n="0343">Once a printer has received all the objects to which its page layouts refer, the printer re-creates the fully-populated layout and then rasterizes and prints it.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0415eb" n="0344">Under normal circumstances, the printer prints pages faster than they can be delivered. Assuming a quarter of each page is covered with images, the average page has a
									size of less than 400 KB. The printer can therefore hold in excess of 100 such pages in its internal 64 MB memory, allowing for temporary buffers etc. The printer prints at a rate of one page
									per second. This is equivalent to 400 KB or about 3 Mbit of page data per second, which is similar to the highest expected rate of page data delivery over a broadband network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f93fa9" n="0345">Even under abnormal circumstances, such as when the printer runs out of paper, it is likely that the user will be able to replenish the paper supply before the
									printer's 100-page internal storage capacity is exhausted.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_41a7a0" n="0346">However, if the printer's internal memory does fill up, then the printer will be unable to make use of a multicast when it first occurs. The netpage publication server
									therefore allows printers to submit requests for re-multicasts. When a critical number of requests is received or a timeout occurs, the server re-multicasts the corresponding shared objects.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_883f94" n="0347">Once a document is printed, a printer can produce an exact duplicate at any time by retrieving its page layouts and contents from the relevant page server.</p>
								<p xml:id="_eb9e70">2.7 On-Demand Documents</p>
								<p xml:id="_df43b3" n="0348">When a netpage document is requested on demand, it can be personalized and delivered in much the same way as a periodical. However, since there is no shared content,
									delivery is made directly to the requesting printer without the use of multicast.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1588c9" n="0349">When a non-netpage document is requested on demand, it is not personalized, and it is delivered via a designated netpage formatting server which reformats it as a
									netpage document. A netpage formatting server is a special instance of a netpage publication server. The netpage formatting server has knowledge of various Internet document formats,
									including Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In the case of HTML, it can make use of the higher resolution of the printed page to present Web pages
									in a multi-column format, with a table of contents. It can automatically include all Web pages directly linked to the requested page. The user can tune this behavior via a preference.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_17dd33" n="0350">The netpage formatting server makes standard netpage behavior, including interactivity and persistence, available on any Internet document, no matter what its origin
									and format. It hides knowledge of different document formats from both the netpage printer and the netpage page server, and hides knowledge of the netpage system from Web servers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_864685">3 Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_6bda41">3.1 Cryptography</p>
								<p xml:id="_955228" n="0351">Cryptography is used to protect sensitive information, both in storage and in transit, and to authenticate parties to a transaction. There are two classes of
									cryptography in widespread use: secret-key cryptography and public-key cryptography. The netpage network uses both classes of cryptography.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_86f37d" n="0352">Secret-key cryptography, also referred to as symmetric cryptography, uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. Two parties wishing to exchange messages must
									first arrange to securely exchange the secret key.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_cd6a32" n="0353">Public-key cryptography, also referred to as asymmetric cryptography, uses two encryption keys. The two keys are mathematically related in such a way that any message
									encrypted using one key can only be decrypted using the other key. One of these keys is then published, while the other is kept private. The public key is used to encrypt any message intended
									for the holder of the private key. Once encrypted using the public key, a message can only be decrypted using the private key. Thus two parties can securely exchange messages without first
									having to exchange a secret key. To ensure that the private key is secure, it is normal for the holder of the private key to generate the key pair.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e2acc3" n="0354">Public-key cryptography can be used to create a digital signature. The holder of the private key can create a known hash of a message and then encrypt the hash using
									the private key. Anyone can then verify that the encrypted hash constitutes the &quot;signature&quot; of the holder of the private key with respect to that particular message by decrypting
									the encrypted hash using the public key and verifying the hash against the message. If the signature is appended to the message, then the recipient of the message can verify both that the
									message is genuine and that it has not been altered in transit.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_12c197" n="0355">To make public-key cryptography work, there has to be a way to distribute public keys which prevents impersonation. This is normally done using certificates and
									certificate authorities. A certificate authority is a trusted third party which authenticates the connection between a public key and someone's identity. The certificate authority verifies
									the person's identity by examining identity documents, and then creates and signs a digital certificate containing the person's identity details and public key. Anyone who trusts the
									certificate authority can use the public key in the certificate with a high degree of certainty that it is genuine. They just have to verify that the certificate has indeed been signed by the
									certificate authority, whose public key is well-known.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_de9df7" n="0356">In most transaction environments, public-key cryptography is only used to create digital signatures and to securely exchange secret session keys. Secret-key
									cryptography is used for all other purposes.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_32fdfa" n="0357">In the following discussion, when reference is made to the secure transmission of information between a netpage printer and a server, what actually happens is that the
									printer obtains the server's certificate, authenticates it with reference to the certificate authority, uses the public key-exchange key in the certificate to exchange a secret session key
									with the server, and then uses the secret session key to encrypt the message data. A session key, by definition, can have an arbitrarily short lifetime.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_828eee">3.2 Netpage Printer Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_00b2d4" n="0358">Each netpage printer is assigned a pair of unique identifiers at time of manufacture which are stored in read-only memory in the printer and in the netpage registration
									server database. The first ID 62 is public and uniquely identifies the printer on the netpage network. The second ID is secret and is used when the printer is first registered on the network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_611ce4" n="0359">When the printer connects to the netpage network for the first time after installation, it creates a signature public/private key pair. It transmits the secret ID and
									the public key securely to the netpage registration server. The server compares the secret ID against the printer's secret ID recorded in its database, and accepts the registration if the IDs
									match. It then creates and signs a certificate containing the printer's public ID and public signature key, and stores the certificate in the registration database.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_00599b" n="0360">The netpage registration server acts as a certificate authority for netpage printers, since it has access to secret information allowing it to verify printer identity.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bb2c91" n="0361">When a user subscribes to a publication, a record is created in the netpage registration server database authorizing the publisher to print the publication to the
									user's default printer or a specified printer. Every document sent to a printer via a page server is addressed to a particular user and is signed by the publisher using the publisher's
									private signature key. The page server verifies, via the registration database, that the publisher is authorized to deliver the publication to the specified user. The page server verifies the
									signature using the publisher's public key, obtained from the publisher's certificate stored in the registration database.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b55ed1" n="0362">The netpage registration server accepts requests to add printing authorizations to the database, so long as those requests are initiated via a pen registered to the
									printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d522d5">3.3 Netpage Pen Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_9df129" n="0363">Each netpage pen is assigned a unique identifier at time of manufacture which is stored in read-only memory in the pen and in the netpage registration server database.
									The pen ID 61 uniquely identifies the pen on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_8618a7" n="0364">A netpage pen can &quot;know&quot; a number of netpage printers, and a printer can &quot;know&quot; a number of pens. A pen communicates with a printer via a radio
									frequency signal whenever it is within range of the printer. Once a pen and printer are registered, they regularly exchange session keys. Whenever the pen transmits digital ink to the
									printer, the digital ink is always encrypted using the appropriate session key. Digital ink is never transmitted in the clear.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_437f13" n="0365">A pen stores a session key for every printer it knows, indexed by printer ID, and a printer stores a session key for every pen it knows, indexed by pen ID. Both have a
									large but finite storage capacity for session keys, and will forget a session key on a least-recently-used basis if necessary.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6ab0ca" n="0366">When a pen comes within range of a printer, the pen and printer discover whether they know each other. If they don't know each other, then the printer determines
									whether it is supposed to know the pen. This might be, for example, because the pen belongs to a user who is registered to use the printer. If the printer is meant to know the pen but
									doesn't, then it initiates the automatic pen registration procedure. If the printer isn't meant to know the pen, then it agrees with the pen to ignore it until the pen is placed in a charging
									cup, at which time it initiates the registration procedure.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ac78cc" n="0367">In addition to its public ID, the pen contains a secret key-exchange key. The key-exchange key is also recorded in the netpage registration server database at time of
									manufacture. During registration, the pen transmits its pen ID to the printer, and the printer transmits the pen ID to the netpage registration server. The server generates a session key for
									the printer and pen to use, and securely transmits the session key to the printer. It also transmits a copy of the session key encrypted with the pen's key-exchange key. The printer stores
									the session key internally, indexed by the pen ID, and transmits the encrypted session key to the pen. The pen stores the session key internally, indexed by the printer ID.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbb1a9" n="0368">Although a fake pen can impersonate a pen in the pen registration protocol, only a real pen can decrypt the session key transmitted by the printer.</p>
								<p xml:id="_00c8c3" n="0369">When a previously unregistered pen is first registered, it is of limited use until it is linked to a user. A registered but &quot;un-owned&quot; pen is only allowed to
									be used to request and fill in netpage user and pen registration forms, to register a new user to which the new pen is automatically linked, or to add a new pen to an existing user.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aded2d" n="0370">The pen uses secret-key rather than public-key encryption because of hardware performance constraints in the pen.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b3884a">3.4 Secure Documents</p>
								<p xml:id="_309d1f" n="0371">The netpage system supports the delivery of secure documents such as tickets and coupons. The netpage printer includes a facility to print watermarks, but will only do
									so on request from publishers who are suitably authorized. The publisher indicates its authority to print watermarks in its certificate, which the printer is able to authenticate.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_42a976" n="0372">The &quot;watermark&quot; printing process uses an alternative dither matrix in specified &quot;watermark&quot; regions of the page. Back-to-back pages contain
									mirror-image watermark regions which coincide when printed. The dither matrices used in odd and even pages' watermark regions are designed to produce an interference effect when the regions
									are viewed together, achieved by looking through the printed sheet.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f77b5" n="0373">The effect is similar to a watermark in that it is not visible when looking at only one side of the page, and is lost when the page is copied by normal means.</p>
								<p xml:id="_751db9" n="0374">Pages of secure documents cannot be copied using the built-in netpage copy mechanism described in Section 1.9 above. This extends to copying netpages on netpage-aware
									photocopiers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aacd95" n="0375">Secure documents are typically generated as part of e-commerce transactions. They can therefore include the user's photograph which was captured when the user
									registered biometric information with the netpage registration server, as described in Section 2.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2babaf" n="0376">When presented with a secure netpage document, the recipient can verify its authenticity by requesting its status in the usual way. The unique ID of a secure document
									is only valid for the lifetime of the document, and secure document IDs are allocated non-contiguously to prevent their prediction by opportunistic forgers. A secure document verification pen
									can be developed with built-in feedback on verification failure, to support easy point-of-presentation document verification.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_781be1" n="0377">Clearly neither the watermark nor the user's photograph are secure in a cryptographic sense. They simply provide a significant obstacle to casual forgery. Online
									document verification, particularly using a verification pen, provides an added level of security where it is needed, but is still not entirely immune to forgeries.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3c755">3.5 Non-Repudiation</p>
								<p xml:id="_9a52f7" n="0378">In the netpage system, forms submitted by users are delivered reliably to forms handlers and are persistently archived on netpage page servers. It is therefore
									impossible for recipients to repudiate delivery.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef4877" n="0379">E-commerce payments made through the system, as described in Section 4, are also impossible for the payee to repudiate.</p>

								<p xml:id="_b57fbd" n="0380">The netpage system uses the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) system as one of its payment systems. SET, having been developed by MasterCard and Visa, is organized
									around payment cards, and this is reflected in the terminology. However, much of the system is independent of the type of accounts being used.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_602f7d" n="0381">In SET, cardholders and merchants register with a certificate authority and are issued with certificates containing their public signature keys. The certificate
									authority verifies a cardholder's registration details with the card issuer as appropriate, and verifies a merchant's registration details with the acquirer as appropriate. Cardholders and
									merchants store their respective private signature keys securely on their computers. During the payment process, these certificates are used to mutually authenticate a merchant and
									cardholder, and to authenticate them both to the payment gateway.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_33f4a2" n="0382">SET has not yet been adopted widely, partly because cardholder maintenance of keys and certificates is considered burdensome. Interim solutions which maintain
									cardholder keys and certificates on a server and give the cardholder access via a password have met with some success.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e63d1b">4.2 Set Payments</p>
								<p xml:id="_d72dd6" n="0383">In the netpage system the netpage registration server acts as a proxy for the netpage user (i.e. the cardholder) in SET payment transactions.</p>
								<p xml:id="_32b39e" n="0384">The netpage system uses biometrics to authenticate the user and authorize SET payments. Because the system is pen-based, the biometric used is the user's on-line
									signature, consisting of time-varying pen position and pressure. A fingerprint biometric can also be used by designing a fingerprint sensor into the pen, although at a higher cost. The type
									of biometric used only affects the capture of the biometric, not the authorization aspects of the system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_da1d61" n="0385">The first step to being able to make SET payments is to register the user's biometric with the netpage registration server. This is done in a controlled environment,
									for example a bank, where the biometric can be captured at the same time as the user's identity is verified. The biometric is captured and stored in the registration database, linked to the
									user's record. The user's photograph is also optionally captured and linked to the record. The SET cardholder registration process is completed, and the resulting private signature key and
									certificate are stored in the database. The user's payment card information is also stored, giving the netpage registration server enough information to act as the user's proxy in any SET
									payment transaction.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a372ac" n="0386">When the user eventually supplies the biometric to complete a payment, for example by signing a netpage order form, the printer securely transmits the order
									information, the pen ID and the biometric data to the netpage registration server. The server verifies the biometric with respect to the user identified by the pen ID, and from then on acts
									as the user's proxy in completing the SET payment transaction.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3e7c95">4.3 Micro-Payments</p>
								<p xml:id="_89891f" n="0387">The netpage system includes a mechanism for micro-payments, to allow the user to be conveniently charged for printing low-cost documents on demand and for copying
									copyright documents, and possibly also to allow the user to be reimbursed for expenses incurred in printing advertising material. The latter depends on the level of subsidy already provided
									to the user.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_35e682" n="0388">When the user registers for e-commerce, a network account is established which aggregates micro-payments. The user receives a statement on a regular basis, and can
									settle any outstanding debit balance using the standard payment mechanism.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3851a2" n="0389">The network account can be extended to aggregate subscription fees for periodicals, which would also otherwise be presented to the user in the form of individual
									statements.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fc894b">4.4 Transactions</p>
								<p xml:id="_0a2ab3" n="0390">When a user requests a netpage in a particular application context, the application is able to embed a user-specific transaction ID 55 in the page. Subsequent input
									through the page is tagged with the transaction ID, and the application is thereby able to establish an appropriate context for the user's input.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_754f91" n="0391">When input occurs through a page which is not user-specific, however, the application must use the user's unique identity to establish a context. A typical example
									involves adding items from a pre-printed catalog page to the user's virtual &quot;shopping cart&quot;. To protect the user's privacy, however, the unique user ID 60 known to the netpage
									system is not divulged to applications. This is to prevent different application providers from easily correlating independently accumulated behavioral data.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3c7431" n="0392">The netpage registration server instead maintains an anonymous relationship between a user and an application via a unique alias ID 65, as shown in FIG. 24. Whenever
									the user activates a hyperlink tagged with the &quot;registered&quot; attribute, the netpage page server asks the netpage registration server to translate the associated application ID 64,
									together with the pen ID 61, into an alias ID 65. The alias ID is then submitted to the hyperlink's application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b9a1cf" n="0393">The application maintains state information indexed by alias ID, and is able to retrieve user-specific state information without knowledge of the global identity of the
									user.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d64184" n="0394">The system also maintains an independent certificate and private signature key for each of a user's applications, to allow it to sign application transactions on behalf
									of the user using only application-specific information.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9e8896" n="0395">To assist the system in routing product bar code (UPC) &quot;hyperlink&quot; activations, the system records a favorite application on behalf of the user for any number
									of product types.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d20d81" n="0396">Each application is associated with an application provider, and the system maintains an account on behalf of each application provider, to allow it to credit and debit
									the provider for click-through fees etc.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b06aae" n="0397">An application provider can be a publisher of periodical subscribed content. The system records the user's willingness to receive the subscribed publication, as well as
									the expected frequency of publication.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_711aaa">4.5 Resource Descriptions and Copyright</p>
								<p xml:id="_45c8bd" n="0398">A preferred embodiment of a resource description class diagram is shown in FIG. 40.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a1e3fa" n="0399">Each document and content object may be described by one or more resource descriptions 842. Resource descriptions use the Dublin Core metadata element set, which is
									designed to facilitate discovery of electronic resources. Dublin Core metadata conforms to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Resource Description Framework (RDF).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c6cdbc" n="0400">A resource description may identify rights holders 920. The netpage system automatically transfers copyright fees from users to rights holders when users print
									copyright content.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e3918c">5 Communications Protocols</p>
								<p xml:id="_6a966a" n="0401">A communications protocol defines an ordered exchange of messages between entities. In the netpage system, entities such as pens, printers and servers utilise a set of
									defined protocols to cooperatively handle user interaction with the netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e89ea9" n="0402">Each protocol is illustrated by way of a sequence diagram in which the horizontal dimension is used to represent message flow and the vertical dimension is used to
									represent time. Each entity is represented by a rectangle containing the name of the entity and a vertical column representing the lifeline of the entity. During the time an entity exists,
									the lifeline is shown as a dashed line. During the time an entity is active, the lifeline is shown as a double line. Because the protocols considered here do not create or destroy entities,
									lifelines are generally cut short as soon as an entity ceases to participate in a protocol.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_45a9cf">5.1 Subscription Delivery Protocol</p>
								<p xml:id="_352772" n="0403">A preferred embodiment of a subscription delivery protocol is shown in FIG. 43.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b5852d" n="0404">A large number of users may subscribe to a periodical publication. Each user's edition may be laid out differently, but many users' editions will share common content
									such as text objects and image objects. The subscription delivery protocol therefore delivers document structures to individual printers via pointcast, but delivers shared content objects via
									multicast.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4fdfb2" n="0405">The application (i.e. publisher) first obtains a document ID 51 for each document from an ID server 12. It then sends each document structure, including its document ID
									and page descriptions, to the page server 10 responsible for the document's newly allocated ID. It includes its own application ID 64, the subscriber's alias ID 65, and the relevant set of
									multicast channel names. It signs the message using its private signature key.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_60b1eb" n="0406">The page server uses the application ID and alias ID to obtain from the registration server the corresponding user ID 60, the user's selected printer ID 62 (which may
									be explicitly selected for the application, or may be the user's default printer), and the application's certificate.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_55776f" n="0407">The application's certificate allows the page server to verify the message signature. The page server's request to the registration server fails if the application ID
									and alias ID don't together identify a subscription 808.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_cec10c" n="0408">The page server then allocates document and page instance IDs and forwards the page descriptions, including page IDs 50, to the printer. It includes the relevant set of
									multicast channel names for the printer to listen to.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9e932c" n="0409">It then returns the newly allocated page IDs to the application for future reference.</p>
								<p xml:id="_fa14e6" n="0410">Once the application has distributed all of the document structures to the subscribers' selected printers via the relevant page servers, it multicasts the various
									subsets of the shared objects on the previously selected multicast channels. Both page servers and printers monitor the appropriate multicast channels and receive their required content
									objects. They are then able to populate the previously pointcast document structures. This allows the page servers to add complete documents to their databases, and it allows the printers to
									print the documents.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7fe3c7">5.2 Hyperlink Activation Protocol</p>
								<p xml:id="_8c56b5" n="0411">A preferred embodiment of a hyperlink activation protocol is shown in FIG. 45.</p>
								<p xml:id="_2187a4" n="0412">When a user clicks on a netpage with a netpage pen, the pen communicates the click to the nearest netpage printer 601. The click identifies the page and a location on
									the page. The printer already knows the ID 61 of the pen from the pen connection protocol.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a851c3" n="0413">The printer determines, via the DNS, the network address of the page server 10a handling the particular page ID 50. The address may already be in its cache if the user
									has recently interacted with the same page. The printer then forwards the pen ID, its own printer ID 62, the page ID and click location to the page server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_dca92c" n="0414">The page server loads the page description 5 identified by the page ID and determines which input element's zone 58, if any, the click lies in. Assuming the relevant
									input element is a hyperlink element 844, the page server then obtains the associated application ID 64 and link ID 54, and determines, via the DNS, the network address of the application
									server hosting the application 71.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0a83be" n="0415">The page server uses the pen ID 61 to obtain the corresponding user ID 60 from the registration server 11, and then allocates a globally unique hyperlink request ID 52
									and builds a hyperlink request 934. The hyperlink request class diagram is shown in FIG. 44. The hyperlink request records the IDs of the requesting user and printer, and identifies the
									clicked hyperlink instance 862. The page server then sends its own server ID 53, the hyperlink request ID, and the link ID to the application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d09947" n="0416">The application produces a response document according to application-specific logic, and obtains a document ID 51 from an ID server 12. It then sends the document to
									the page server 10b responsible for the document's newly allocated ID, together with the requesting page server's ID and the hyperlink request ID.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f2b3ee" n="0417">The second page server sends the hyperlink request ID and application ID to the first page server to obtain the corresponding user ID and printer ID 62. The first page
									server rejects the request if the hyperlink request has expired or is for a different application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_370d31" n="0418">The second page server allocates document instance and page IDs 50, returns the newly allocated page IDs to the application, adds the complete document to its own
									database, and finally sends the page descriptions to the requesting printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6fef03" n="0419">The hyperlink instance may include a meaningful transaction ID 55, in which case the first page server includes the transaction ID in the message sent to the
									application. This allows the application to establish a transaction-specific context for the hyperlink activation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_01b6fd" n="0420">If the hyperlink requires a user alias, i.e. its &quot;alias required&quot; attribute is set, then the first page server sends both the pen ID 61 and the hyperlink's
									application ID 64 to the registration server 11 to obtain not just the user ID corresponding to the pen ID but also the alias ID 65 corresponding to the application ID and the user ID. It
									includes the alias ID in the message sent to the application, allowing the application to establish a user-specific context for the hyperlink activation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_28bd16">5.3 Handwriting Recognition Protocol</p>
								<p xml:id="_27da34" n="0421">When a user draws a stroke on a netpage with a netpage pen, the pen communicates the stroke to the nearest netpage printer. The stroke identifies the page and a path on
									the page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d0a3d7" n="0422">The printer forwards the pen ID 61, its own printer ID 62, the page ID 50 and stroke path to the page server 10 in the usual way.</p>
								<p xml:id="_f8a6da" n="0423">The page server loads the page description 5 identified by the page ID and determines which input element's zone 58, if any, the stroke intersects. Assuming the
									relevant input element is a text field 878, the page server appends the stroke to the text field's digital ink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_854bb3" n="0424">After a period of inactivity in the zone of the text field, the page server sends the pen ID and the pending strokes to the registration server 11 for interpretation.
									The registration server identifies the user corresponding to the pen, and uses the user's accumulated handwriting model 822 to interpret the strokes as handwritten text. Once it has converted
									the strokes to text, the registration server returns the text to the requesting page server. The page server appends the text to the text value of the text field.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c97bf3">5.4 Signature Verification Protocol</p>
								<p xml:id="_793188" n="0425">Assuming the input element whose zone the stroke intersects is a signature field 880, the page server 10 appends the stroke to the signature field's digital ink.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a16e02" n="0426">After a period of inactivity in the zone of the signature field, the page server sends the pen ID 61 and the pending strokes to the registration server 11 for
									verification. It also sends the application ID 64 associated with the form of which the signature field is part, as well as the form ID 56 and the current data content of the form. The
									registration server identifies the user corresponding to the pen, and uses the user's dynamic signature biometric 818 to verify the strokes as the user's signature. Once it has verified the
									signature, the registration server uses the application ID 64 and user ID 60 to identify the user's application-specific private signature key. It then uses the key to generate a digital
									signature of the form data, and returns the digital signature to the requesting page server. The page server assigns the digital signature to the signature field and sets the associated
									form's status to frozen.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_367536" n="0427">The digital signature includes the alias ID 65 of the corresponding user. This allows a single form to capture multiple users' signatures.</p>

								<p xml:id="_a7a752" n="0429">Form submission occurs via a form hyperlink activation. It thus follows the protocol defined in Section 5.2, with some form-specific additions.</p>
								<p xml:id="_d28a87" n="0430">In the case of a form hyperlink, the hyperlink activation message sent by the page server 10 to the application 71 also contains the form ID 56 and the current data
									content of the form. If the form contains any signature fields, then the application verifies each one by extracting the alias ID 65 associated with the corresponding digital signature and

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2b4b35" n="0434">The target application receives the hyperlink request ID from the page server when the hyperlink is first activated, as described in Section 5.2. When the target
									application needs to credit the source application provider, it sends the application provider credit to the original page server together with the hyperlink request ID. The page server uses
									the hyperlink request ID to identify the source application, and sends the credit on to the relevant registration server 11 together with the source application ID 64, its own server ID 53,

								<p xml:id="_9d1243" n="0453">The image sensor is a 215*215 pixel CCD (such a sensor is produced by Matsushita Electronic Corporation, and is described in a paper by Itakura, K T Nobusada, N
									Okusenya, R Nagayoshi, and M Ozaki, &quot;A 1 mm 50 k-Pixel IT CCD Image Sensor for Miniature Camera System&quot;, IEEE Transactions on Electronic Devices, Volt 47, number 1, January 2000,

								<p xml:id="_b8b40d" n="0456">In an alternative embodiment, the pen incorporates an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) interface for short-range communication with a base station or netpage printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_32191f" n="0457">In a further embodiment, the pen 101 includes a pair of orthogonal accelerometers mounted in the normal plane of the pen 101 axis. The accelerometers 190 are shown in
									FIGS. 9 and 10 in ghost outline.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b9553b" n="0458">The provision of the accelerometers enables this embodiment of the pen 101 to sense motion without reference to surface location tags, allowing the location tags to be
									sampled at a lower rate. Each location tag ID can then identify an object of interest rather than a position on the surface. For example, if the object is a user interface input element (e.g.
									a command button), then the tag ID of each location tag within the area of the input element can directly identify the input element.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ab283c" n="0459">The acceleration measured by the accelerometers in each of the x and y directions is integrated with respect to time to produce an instantaneous velocity and position.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_877ff7" n="0460">Since the starting position of the stroke is not known, only relative positions within a stroke are calculated. Although position integration accumulates errors in the
									sensed acceleration, accelerometers typically have high resolution, and the time duration of a stroke, over which errors accumulate, is short.

								<p xml:id="_8487c7">7.1 Printer Mechanics</p>
								<p xml:id="_9255b3" n="0461">The vertically-mounted netpage wallprinter 601 is shown fully assembled in FIG. 11. It prints netpages on Letter/A4 sized media using duplexed 8[1/2]'' Memjet(TM) print
									engines 602 and 603, as shown in FIGS. 12 and 12a. It uses a straight paper path with the paper 604 passing through the duplexed print engines 602 and 603 which print both sides of a sheet
									simultaneously, in full color and with full bleed.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b5acfa" n="0462">An integral binding assembly 605 applies a strip of glue along one edge of each printed sheet, allowing it to adhere to the previous sheet when pressed against it. This
									creates a final bound document 618 which can range in thickness from one sheet to several hundred sheets.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_211a84" n="0463">The replaceable ink cartridge 627, shown in FIG. 13 coupled with the duplexed print engines, has bladders or chambers for storing fixative, adhesive, and cyan, magenta,
									yellow, black and infrared inks. The cartridge also contains a micro air filter in a base molding. The micro air filter interfaces with an air pump 638 inside the printer via a hose 639. This
									provides filtered air to the printheads to prevent ingress of micro particles into the Memjet(TM) printheads 350 which might otherwise clog the printhead nozzles. By incorporating the air
									filter within the cartridge, the operational life of the filter is effectively linked to the life of the cartridge. The ink cartridge is a fully recyclable product with a capacity for
									printing and gluing 3000 pages (1500 sheets).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_dd8894" n="0464">Referring to FIG. 12, the motorized media pick-up roller assembly 626 pushes the top sheet directly from the media tray past a paper sensor on the first print engine
									602 into the duplexed Memjet(TM) printhead assembly. The two Memjet(TM) print engines 602 and 603 are mounted in an opposing in-line sequential configuration along the straight paper path.
									The paper 604is drawn into the first print engine 602 by integral, powered pick-up rollers 626. The position and size of the paper 604 is sensed and full bleed printing commences. Fixative is
									printed simultaneously to aid drying in the shortest possible time.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1aba14" n="0465">The paper exits the first Memjet(TM) print engine 602 through a set of powered exit spike wheels (aligned along the straight paper path), which act against a rubberized
									roller. These spike wheels contact the 'wet' printed surface and continue to feed the sheet 604 into the second Memjet(TM) print engine 603.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ee467e" n="0466">Referring to FIGS. 12 and 12a, the paper 604 passes from the duplexed print engines 602 and 603 into the binder assembly 605. The printed page passes between a powered
									spike wheel axle 670 with a fibrous support roller and another movable axle with spike wheels and a momentary action glue wheel. The movable axle/glue assembly 673 is mounted to a metal
									support bracket and it is transported forward to interface with the powered axle 670 via gears by action of a camshaft. A separate motor powers this camshaft.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a0aac0" n="0467">The glue wheel assembly 673 consists of a partially hollow axle 679 with a rotating coupling for the glue supply hose 641 from the ink cartridge 627. This axle 679
									connects to a glue wheel, which absorbs adhesive by capillary action through radial holes. A molded housing 682 surrounds the glue wheel, with an opening at the front. Pivoting side moldings
									and sprung outer doors are attached to the metal bracket and hinge out sideways when the rest of the assembly 673 is thrust forward. This action exposes the glue wheel through the front of
									the molded housing 682. Tension springs close the assembly and effectively cap the glue wheel during periods of inactivity.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_549170" n="0468">As the sheet 604 passes into the glue wheel assembly 673, adhesive is applied to one vertical edge on the front side (apart from the first sheet of a document) as it is
									transported down into the binding assembly 605.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_99fa4e">7.2 Printer Controller Architecture</p>
								<p xml:id="_1d3137" n="0469">The netpage printer controller consists of a controlling processor 750, a factory-installed or field-installed network interface module 625, a radio transceiver
									(transceiver controller 753, baseband circuit 754, RF circuit 755, and RF resonators and inductors 756), dual raster image processor (RIP) DSPs 757, duplexed print engine controllers 760a and
									760b, flash memory 658, and 64 MB of DRAM 657, as illustrated in FIG. 14.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5f3119" n="0470">The controlling processor handles communication with the network 19 and with local wireless netpage pens 101, senses the help button 617, controls the user interface
									LEDs 613-616, and feeds and synchronizes the RIP DSPs 757 and print engine controllers 760. It consists of a medium-performance general-purpose microprocessor. The controlling processor 750
									communicates with the print engine controllers 760 via a high-speed serial bus 659.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_27ecc3" n="0471">The RIP DSPs rasterize and compress page descriptions to the netpage printer's compressed page format. Each print engine controller expands, dithers and prints page
									images to its associated Memjet(TM) printhead 350 in real time (i.e. at over 30 pages per minute). The duplexed print engine controllers print both sides of a sheet simultaneously.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_102bd8" n="0472">The master print engine controller 760a controls the paper transport and monitors ink usage in conjunction with the master QA chip 665 and the ink cartridge QA chip
									761.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_47b692" n="0473">The printer controller's flash memory 658 holds the software for both the processor 750 and the DSPs 757, as well as configuration data. This is copied to main memory
									657 at boot time.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7369b5" n="0474">The processor 750, DSPs 757, and digital transceiver components (transceiver controller 753 and baseband circuit 754) are integrated in a single controller ASIC 656.
									Analog RF components (RF circuit 755 and RF resonators and inductors 756) are provided in a separate RF chip 762. The network interface module 625 is separate, since netpage printers allow
									the network connection to be factory-selected or field-selected. Flash memory 658 and the 2*256 Mbit (64 MB) DRAM 657 is also off-chip. The print engine controllers 760 are provided in
									separate ASICs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b494c0" n="0475">A variety of network interface modules 625 are provided, each providing a netpage network interface 751 and optionally a local computer or network interface 752.
									Netpage network Internet interfaces include POTS modems, Hybrid Fiber-Coax (HFC) cable modems, ISDN modems, DSL modems, satellite transceivers, current and next-generation cellular telephone
									transceivers, and wireless local loop (WLL) transceivers. Local interfaces include IEEE 1284 (parallel port), 10Base-T and 100Base-T Ethernet, USB and USB 2.0, IEEE 1394 (Firewire), and
									various emerging home networking interfaces. If an Internet connection is available on the local network, then the local network interface can be used as the netpage network interface.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7d3149" n="0476">The radio transceiver 753 communicates in the unlicensed 900 MHz band normally used by cordless telephones, or alternatively in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz industrial,
									scientific and medical (ISM) band, and uses frequency hopping and collision detection to provide interference-free communication.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_400e2b" n="0477">The printer controller optionally incorporates an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) interface for receiving data &quot;squirted&quot; from devices such as netpage
									cameras. In an alternative embodiment, the printer uses the IrDA interface for short-range communication with suitably configured netpage pens.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_41ac97">7.2.1 Rasterization and Printing</p>
								<p xml:id="_e28d78" n="0478">Once the main processor 750 has received and verified the document's page layouts and page objects, it runs the appropriate RIP software on the DSPs 757.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0b9ed8" n="0479">The DSPs 757 rasterize each page description and compress the rasterized page image. The main processor stores each compressed page image in memory. The simplest way to
									load-balance multiple DSPs is to let each DSP rasterize a separate page. The DSPs can always be kept busy since an arbitrary number of rasterized pages can, in general, be stored in memory.
									This strategy only leads to potentially poor DSP utilization when rasterizing short documents.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_8741ee" n="0480">Watermark regions in the page description are rasterized to a contone-resolution bi-level bitmap which is losslessly compressed to negligible size and which forms part
									of the compressed page image.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_151583" n="0481">The infrared (IR) layer of the printed page contains coded netpage tags at a density of about six per inch. Each tag encodes the page ID, tag ID, and control bits, and
									the data content of each tag is generated during rasterization and stored in the compressed page image.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_50665c" n="0482">The main processor 750 passes back-to-back page images to the duplexed print engine controllers 760. Each print engine controller 760 stores the compressed page image
									in its local memory, and starts the page expansion and printing pipeline. Page expansion and printing is pipelined because it is impractical to store an entire 114 MB bi-level CMYK+IR page
									image in memory.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4beca4">7.2.2 Print Engine Controller</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a910d" n="0483">The page expansion and printing pipeline of the print engine controller 760 consists of a high speed IEEE 1394 serial interface 659, a standard JPEG decoder 763, a
									standard Group 4 Fax decoder 764, a custom halftoner/compositor unit 765, a custom tag encoder 766, a line loader/formatter unit 767, and a custom interface 768 to the Memjet(TM) printhead
									350.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_92194b" n="0484">The print engine controller 360 operates in a double buffered manner. While one page is loaded into DRAM 769 via the high speed serial interface 659, the previously
									loaded page is read from DRAM 769 and passed through the print engine controller pipeline. Once the page has finished printing, the page just loaded is printed while another page is loaded.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a2a53f" n="0485">The first stage of the pipeline expands (at 763) the JPEG-compressed contone CMYK layer, expands (at 764) the Group 4 Fax-compressed bi-level black layer, and renders
									(at 766) the bi-level netpage tag layer according to the tag format defined in section 1.2, all in parallel. The second stage dithers (at 765) the contone CMYK layer and composites (at 765)
									the bi-level black layer over the resulting bi-level CMYK layer. The resultant bi-level CMYK+IR dot data is buffered and formatted (at 767) for printing on the Memjet(TM) printhead 350 via a
									set of line buffers. Most of these line buffers are stored in the off-chip DRAM. The final stage prints the six channels of bi-level dot data (including fixative) to the Memjet(TM) printhead
									350 via the printhead interface 768.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_147f8e" n="0486">When several print engine controllers 760 are used in unison, such as in a duplexed configuration, they are synchronized via a shared line sync signal 770. Only one
									print engine 760, selected via the external master/slave pin 771, generates the line sync signal 770 onto the shared line.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_65d171" n="0487">The print engine controller 760 contains a low-speed processor 772 for synchronizing the page expansion and rendering pipeline, configuring the printhead 350 via a
									low-speed serial bus 773, and controlling the stepper motors 675, 676.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_06eadc" n="0488">In the 8[1/2]'' versions of the netpage printer, the two print engines each prints 30 Letter pages per minute along the long dimension of the page (11''), giving a line
									rate of 8.8 kHz at 1600 dpi. In the 12'' versions of the netpage printer, the two print engines each prints 45 Letter pages per minute along the short dimension of the page (8[1/2]''), giving
									a line rate of 10.2 kHz. These line rates are well within the operating frequency of the Memjet(TM) printhead, which in the current design exceeds 30 kHz.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1de07c">8 Netpage Greeting Cards</p>
								<p xml:id="_b5e28e" n="0489">The netpage system provides an application whereby a user can create a customised greeting card by selecting an image and a greeting message, and adding a handwritten
									message. The card can be sent to the recipient either directly to their default netpage printer, or to their postal address.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_29565f" n="0490">A user can select a greeting card from an on-line catalogue, add a handwritten message, and dispatch it via the netpage network. Cards can be addressed to other netpage
									users, and to normal postal addresses. In the latter case the card is printed at the service centre closest to the recipient, automatically placed in an envelope, and mailed through the local
									mail system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bae99f" n="0491">Netpage users can choose to receive cards from anyone, or only from authorised friends.</p>
								<p xml:id="_ee165f">8.1 Application Diagram Notation</p>
								<p xml:id="_6ad290" n="0492">Each application user interface flow is illustrated as a collection of documents linked by command arrows. A command arrow indicates that the target document is printed
									as a result of the user pressing the corresponding command button on the source page. Some command arrows are labelled with multiple commands separated by slashes ('/'s), indicating that any
									one of the specified commands causes the target document to be printed. Although multiple commands may label the same command arrow, they typically have different side-effects.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdbea7" n="0493">In application terms, it is important to distinguish between netpage documents and netpage forms. Documents contain printed information, as well as command buttons
									which can be pressed by the user to request further information or some other action. Forms, in addition to behaving like normal documents, also contain input fields which can be filled in by
									the user. They provide the system with a data input mechanism. It is also useful to distinguish between documents which contain generic information and documents which contain information
									specific to a particular interaction between the user and an application. Generic documents may be pre-printed publications such as magazines sold at news stands or advertising posters
									encountered in public places. Forms may also be pre-printed, including, for example, subscription forms encountered in pre-printed publications. They may, of course, also be generated
									on-the-fly by a netpage printer in response to user requests. User-specific documents and forms are normally generated on the fly by a netpage printer in response to user requests. FIG. 48
									shows a generic document 990, a generic form 991, a user-specific document 992, and a user-specific form 993.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e403d1" n="0494">Netpages which participate in a user interface flow are further described by abstract page layouts. A page layout may contain various kinds of elements, each of which
									has a unique style to differentiate it from the others. As shown in FIG. 49, these include fixed information 994, variable information 995, input fields 996, command buttons 997, and
									draggable commands 998.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f986c3" n="0495">When a user interface flow is broken up into multiple diagrams, any document which is duplicated is shown with dashed outlines in all but the main diagram which defines
									it.

								<p xml:id="_110df7" n="0501">A customer 502 can create a customised card 508. Each customised card has a unique identifier 509, the date and time the card was created, the custom message
									handwritten by the user (stored as digital ink), and a fee. Each customised card has a recipient 510. If the recipient is another netpage user, the card is delivered directly to their default
									netpage printer. If the recipient is not a netpage user, the customer specifies the name and postal address for delivery of the card. The Card Recipient class diagram 511 is shown in FIG. 52.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5964bc" n="0502">Each customer 502 has an account 512 with the supplier 501, with a running balance 513. Account payments 547 are associated directly with the customer account. The

									extracted from the recipient address. The envelope and card are printed at the country and city specific service center and mailed through the local mail system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2f6d16" n="0527">The Compose Greeting Card function is a multi-page transaction. To assist the user in keeping track of the pages relevant to a single greeting card, the transaction

								<p xml:id="_65348a">BACKGROUND</p>
								<p xml:id="_77bf76" n="0006">Paper is widely used to display and record information. Printed information is easier to read than information displayed on a computer screen. Hand-drawing and
									handwriting afford greater richness of expression than input via a computer keyboard and mouse. Moreover, paper doesn't run on batteries, can be read in bright light, more robustly accepts
									coffee spills, and is portable and disposable.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_968fa0" n="0007">Online publication has many advantages over traditional paper-based publication. From a consumer's point of view, information is available on demand, information can be
									navigated via hypertext links, searched and automatically personalized.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0ac795" n="0008">From the publisher's point of view, the costs of printing and physical distribution are eliminated, and the publication becomes more attractive to the advertisers who
									pay for it because it can be targeted to specific demographics and linked to product sites.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d9c9ce" n="0009">Online publication also has disadvantages. Computer screens are inferior to paper. At the same quality as a magazine page, an SVGA computer screen displays only about a
									fifth as much information. Both CRTs and LCDs have brightness and contrast problems, particularly when ambient light is strong, while ink on paper, being reflective rather than emissive, is
									both bright and sharp in ambient light.

								<p xml:id="_d2da74">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED AND OTHER EMBODIMENTS</p>
								<p xml:id="_1a08b0" n="0102">Note: Memjet(TM) is a trade mark of Silverbrook Research Pty Ltd, Australia.</p>
								<p xml:id="_15a829" n="0103">In the preferred embodiment, the invention is configured to work with the netpage networked computer system, a detailed overview of which follows. It will be
									appreciated that not every implementation will necessarily embody all or even most of the specific details and extensions discussed below in relation to the basic system. However, the system
									is described in its most complete form to reduce the need for external reference when attempting to understand the context in which the preferred embodiments and aspects of the present
									invention operate.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d7b593" n="0104">In brief summary, the preferred form of the netpage system employs a computer interface in the form of a mapped surface, that is, a physical surface which contains
									references to a map of the surface maintained in a computer system. The map references can be queried by an appropriate sensing device. Depending upon the specific implementation, the map
									references may be encoded visibly or invisibly, and defined in such a way that a local query on the mapped surface yields an unambiguous map reference both within the map and among different
									maps. The computer system can contain information about features on the mapped surface, and such information can be retrieved based on map references supplied by a sensing device used with
									the mapped surface. The information thus retrieved can take the form of actions which are initiated by the computer system on behalf of the operator in response to the operator's interaction
									with the surface features.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1709a2" n="0105">In its preferred form, the netpage system relies on the production of, and human interaction with, netpages. These are pages of text, graphics and images printed on
									ordinary paper, but which work like interactive web pages. Information is encoded on each page using ink which is substantially invisible to the unaided human eye. The ink, however, and
									thereby the coded data, can be sensed by an optically imaging pen and transmitted to the netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f8217" n="0106">In the preferred form, active buttons and hyperlinks on each page can be clicked with the pen to request information from the network or to signal preferences to a
									network server. In one embodiment, text written by hand on a netpage is automatically recognized and converted to computer text in the netpage system, allowing forms to be filled in. In other
									embodiments, signatures recorded on a netpage are automatically verified, allowing e-commerce transactions to be securely authorized.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0c3540" n="0107">As illustrated in FIG. 1, a printed netpage 1 can represent a interactive form which can be filled in by the user both physically, on the printed page, and
									&quot;electronically&quot;, via communication between the pen and the netpage system. The example shows a &quot;Request&quot; form containing name and address fields and a submit button. The
									netpage consists of graphic data 2 printed using visible ink, and coded data 3 printed as a collection of tags 4 using invisible ink. The corresponding page description 5, stored on the
									netpage network, describes the individual elements of the netpage. In particular it describes the type and spatial extent (zone) of each interactive element (i.e. text field or button in the
									example), to allow the netpage system to correctly interpret input via the netpage. The submit button 6, for example, has a zone 7 which corresponds to the spatial extent of the corresponding
									graphic 8.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4b690e" n="0108">As illustrated in FIG. 2, the netpage pen 101, a preferred form of which is shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 and described in more detail below, works in conjunction with a
									netpage printer 601, an Internet-connected printing appliance for home, office or mobile use. The pen is wireless and communicates securely with the netpage printer via a short-range radio
									link 9.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7d3801" n="0109">The netpage printer 601, a preferred form of which is shown in FIGS. 11 to 13 and described in more detail below, is able to deliver, periodically or on demand,
									personalized newspapers, magazines, catalogs, greeting cards and other publications, all printed at high quality as interactive netpages. Unlike a personal computer, the netpage printer is an
									appliance which can be, for example, wall-mounted adjacent to an area where the morning news is first consumed, such as in a user's kitchen, near a breakfast table, or near the household's
									point of departure for the day. It also comes in tabletop, desktop, portable and miniature versions.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_62a805" n="0110">Netpages printed at their point of consumption combine the ease-of-use of paper with the timeliness and interactivity of an interactive medium.</p>
								<p xml:id="_44d96c" n="0111">As shown in FIG. 2, the netpage pen 101 interacts with the coded data on a printed netpage 1 and communicates, via a short-range radio link 9, the interaction to a
									netpage printer. The printer 601 sends the interaction to the relevant netpage page server 10 for interpretation. In appropriate circumstances, the page server sends a corresponding message
									to application computer software running on a netpage application server 13. The application server may in turn send a response which is printed on the originating printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d68ffb" n="0112">The netpage system is made considerably more convenient in the preferred embodiment by being used in conjunction with high-speed microelectromechanical system (MEMS)
									based inkjet (Memjet(TM)) printers. In the preferred form of this technology, relatively high-speed and high-quality printing is made more affordable to consumers. In its preferred form, a
									netpage publication has the physical characteristics of a traditional newsmagazine, such as a set of letter-size glossy pages printed in full color on both sides, bound together for easy
									navigation and comfortable handling.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7574e0" n="0113">The netpage printer exploits the growing availability of broadband Internet access. Cable service is available to 95% of households in the United States, and cable
									modem service offering broadband Internet access is already available to 20% of these. The netpage printer can also operate with slower connections, but with longer delivery times and lower
									image quality. Indeed, the netpage system can be enabled using existing consumer inkjet and laser printers, although the system will operate more slowly and will therefore be less acceptable
									from a consumer's point of view. In other embodiments, the netpage system is hosted on a private intranet. In still other embodiments, the netpage system is hosted on a single computer or
									computer-enabled device, such as a printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbdc6f" n="0114">Netpage publication servers 14 on the netpage network are configured to deliver print-quality publications to netpage printers. Periodical publications are delivered
									automatically to subscribing netpage printers via pointcasting and multicasting Internet protocols. Personalized publications are filtered and formatted according to individual user profiles.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c1de77" n="0115">A netpage printer can be configured to support any number of pens, and a pen can work with any number of netpage printers. In the preferred implementation, each netpage
									pen has a unique identifier. A household may have a collection of colored netpage pens, one assigned to each member of the family. This allows each user to maintain a distinct profile with
									respect to a netpage publication server or application server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_478f3f" n="0116">A netpage pen can also be registered with a netpage registration server 11 and linked to one or more payment card accounts. This allows e-commerce payments to be
									securely authorized using the netpage pen. The netpage registration server compares the signature captured by the netpage pen with a previously registered signature, allowing it to
									authenticate the user's identity to an e-commerce server. Other biometrics can also be used to verify identity. A version of the netpage pen includes fingerprint scanning, verified in a
									similar way by the netpage registration server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4617cb" n="0117">Although a netpage printer may deliver periodicals such as the morning newspaper without user intervention, it can be configured never to deliver unsolicited junk mail.
									In its preferred form, it only delivers periodicals from subscribed or otherwise authorized sources. In this respect, the netpage printer is unlike a fax machine or e-mail account which is
									visible to any junk mailer who knows the telephone number or email address.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_75e850">1 Netpage System Architecture</p>
								<p xml:id="_d269d9" n="0118">Each object model in the system is described using a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram. A class diagram consists of a set of object classes connected by
									relationships, and two kinds of relationships are of interest here: associations and generalizations. An association represents some kind of relationship between objects, i.e. between
									instances of classes. A generalization relates actual classes, and can be understood in the following way: if a class is thought of as the set of all objects of that class, and class A is a
									generalization of class B, then B is simply a subset of A. The UML does not directly support second-order modelling-i.e. classes of classes.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fcc8c4" n="0119">Each class is drawn as a rectangle labelled with the name of the class. It contains a list of the attributes of the class, separated from the name by a horizontal line,
									and a list of the operations of the class, separated from the attribute list by a horizontal line. In the class diagrams which follow, however, operations are never modelled.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_930450" n="0120">An association is drawn as a line joining two classes, optionally labelled at either end with the multiplicity of the association. The default multiplicity is one. An
									asterisk (*) indicates a multiplicity of &quot;many&quot;, i.e. zero or more. Each association is optionally labelled with its name, and is also optionally labelled at either end with the
									role of the corresponding class. An open diamond indicates an aggregation association (&quot;is-part-of&quot;), and is drawn at the aggregator end of the association line.</p>
								<p xml:id="_65d51d" n="0121">A generalization relationship (&quot;is-a&quot;) is drawn as a solid line joining two classes, with an arrow (in the form of an open triangle) at the generalization
									end.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9a7424" n="0122">When a class diagram is broken up into multiple diagrams, any class which is duplicated is shown with a dashed outline in all but the main diagram which defines it. It

								<p xml:id="_81174a" n="0123">Netpages are the foundation on which a netpage network is built. They provide a paper-based user interface to published information and interactive services.</p>
								<p xml:id="_94b170" n="0124">A netpage consists of a printed page (or other surface region) invisibly tagged with references to an online description of the page. The online page description is
									maintained persistently by a netpage page server. The page description describes the visible layout and content of the page, including text, graphics and images. It also describes the input
									elements on the page, including buttons, hyperlinks, and input fields. A netpage allows markings made with a netpage pen on its surface to be simultaneously captured and processed by the
									netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b6bc7b" n="0125">Multiple netpages can share the same page description. However, to allow input through otherwise identical pages to be distinguished, each netpage is assigned a unique
									page identifier. This page ID has sufficient precision to distinguish between a very large number of netpages.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5634bd" n="0126">Each reference to the page description is encoded in a printed tag. The tag identifies the unique page on which it appears, and thereby indirectly identifies the page
									description. The tag also identifies its own position on the page. Characteristics of the tags are described in more detail below.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_8caa37" n="0127">Tags are printed in infrared-absorptive ink on any substrate which is infrared-reflective, such as ordinary paper. Near-infrared wavelengths are invisible to the human
									eye but are easily sensed by a solid-state image sensor with an appropriate filter.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_27362c" n="0128">A tag is sensed by an area image sensor in the netpage pen, and the tag data is transmitted to the netpage system via the nearest netpage printer. The pen is wireless
									and communicates with the netpage printer via a short-range radio link. Tags are sufficiently small and densely arranged that the pen can reliably image at least one tag even on a single
									click on the page. It is important that the pen recognize the page ID and position on every interaction with the page, since the interaction is stateless. Tags are error-correctably encoded
									to make them partially tolerant to surface damage.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_972a8e" n="0129">The netpage page server maintains a unique page instance for each printed netpage, allowing it to maintain a distinct set of user-supplied values for input fields in
									the page description for each printed netpage.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c68ff4" n="0130">The relationship between the page description, the page instance, and the printed netpage is shown in FIG. 4. The page instance is associated with both the netpage
									printer which printed it and, if known, the netpage user who requested it.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f4c7d7">1.2 Netpage Tags</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbf070">1.2.1 Tag Data Content</p>
								<p xml:id="_a44ff8" n="0131">In a preferred form, each tag identifies the region in which it appears, and the location of that tag within the region. A tag may also contain flags which relate to
									the region as a whole or to the tag. One or more flag bits may, for example, signal a tag sensing device to provide feedback indicative of a function associated with the immediate area of the
									tag, without the sensing device having to refer to a description of the region. A netpage pen may, for example, illuminate an &quot;active area&quot; LED when in the zone of a hyperlink.</p>
								<p xml:id="_25fa3a" n="0132">As will be more clearly explained below, in a preferred embodiment, each tag contains an easily recognized invariant structure which aids initial detection, and which
									assists in minimizing the effect of any warp induced by the surface or by the sensing process. The tags preferably tile the entire page, and are sufficiently small and densely arranged that
									the pen can reliably image at least one tag even on a single click on the page. It is important that the pen recognize the page ID and position on every interaction with the page, since the
									interaction is stateless.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c5c2c2" n="0133">
									In a preferred embodiment, the region to which a tag refers coincides with an entire page, and the region ID encoded in the tag is therefore synonomous with the page ID of the page on which
									the tag appears. In other embodiments, the region to which a tag refers can be an arbitrary subregion of a page or other surface. For example, it can coincide with the zone of an interactive
									element, in which case the region ID can directly identify the interactive element.

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_976706" n="0134">Each tag contains 120 bits of information, typically allocated as shown in Table 1. Assuming a maximum tag density of 64 per square inch, a 16-bit tag ID supports a
									region size of up to 1024 square inches. Larger regions can be mapped continuously without increasing the tag ID precision simply by using abutting regions and maps. The 100-bit region ID
									allows 2&lt;100 &gt; (10&lt;30 &gt; or a million trillion trillion) different regions to be uniquely identified.</p>
								<p xml:id="_2600b9">1.2.2 Tag Data Encoding</p>
								<p xml:id="_e12e82" n="0135">The 120 bits of tag data are redundantly encoded using a (15, 5) Reed-Solomon code. This yields 360 encoded bits consisting of 6 codewords of 15 4-bit symbols each. The
									(15, 5) code allows up to 5 symbol errors to be corrected per codeword, i.e. it is tolerant of a symbol error rate of up to 33% per codeword.</p>
								<p xml:id="_f58fe6" n="0136">Each 4-bit symbol is represented in a spatially coherent way in the tag, and the symbols of the six codewords are interleaved spatially within the tag. This ensures
									that a burst error (an error affecting multiple spatially adjacent bits) damages a minimum number of symbols overall and a minimum number of symbols in any one codeword, thus maximising the
									likelihood that the burst error can be fully corrected.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d28cd0">1.2.3 Physical Tag Structure</p>
								<p xml:id="_f3859a" n="0137">The physical representation of the tag, shown in FIG. 5, includes fixed target structures 15, 16, 17 and variable data areas 18. The fixed target structures allow a
									sensing device such as the netpage pen to detect the tag and infer its three-dimensional orientation relative to the sensor. The data areas contain representations of the individual bits of
									the encoded tag data.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f78258" n="0138">To achieve proper tag reproduction, the tag is rendered at a resolution of 256*256 dots. When printed at 1600 dots per inch this yields a tag with a diameter of about 4
									mm. At this resolution the tag is designed to be surrounded by a &quot;quiet area&quot; of radius 16 dots. Since the quiet area is also contributed by adjacent tags, it only adds 16 dots to
									the effective diameter of the tag.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3530a4" n="0139">The tag includes six target structures. A detection ring 15 allows the sensing device to initially detect the tag. The ring is easy to detect because it is rotationally
									invariant and because a simple correction of its aspect ratio removes most of the effects of perspective distortion. An orientation axis 16 allows the sensing device to determine the
									approximate planar orientation of the tag due to the yaw of the sensor. The orientation axis is skewed to yield a unique orientation. Four perspective targets 17 allow the sensing device to
									infer an accurate two-dimensional perspective transform of the tag and hence an accurate three-dimensional position and orientation of the tag relative to the sensor.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_42fc4f" n="0140">All target structures are redundantly large to improve their immunity to noise.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0f502a" n="0141">The overall tag shape is circular. This supports, amongst other things, optimal tag packing on an irregular triangular grid. In combination with the circular detection
									ring, this makes a circular arrangement of data bits within the tag optimal. To maximise its size, each data bit is represented by a radial wedge in the form of an area bounded by two radial
									lines and two concentric circular arcs. Each wedge has a minimum dimension of 8 dots at 1600 dpi and is designed so that its base (its inner arc), is at least equal to this minimum dimension.
									The height of the wedge in the radial direction is always equal to the minimum dimension. Each 4-bit data symbol is represented by an array of 2*2 wedges.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_48ab70" n="0142">The 15 4-bit data symbols of each of the six codewords are allocated to the four concentric symbol rings 18a to 18d in interleaved fashion. Symbols are allocated
									alternately in circular progression around the tag.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3eaec5" n="0143">The interleaving is designed to maximise the average spatial distance between any two symbols of the same codeword.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a4e322" n="0144">In order to support &quot;single-click&quot; interaction with a tagged region via a sensing device, the sensing device must be able to see at least one entire tag in
									its field of view no matter where in the region or at what orientation it is positioned. The required diameter of the field of view of the sensing device is therefore a function of the size
									and spacing of the tags.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a1f9a0" n="0145">Assuming a circular tag shape, the minimum diameter of the sensor field of view is obtained when the tags are tiled on a equilateral triangular grid, as shown in FIG.
									6.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6cfff7">1.2.5 Tag Image Processing and Decoding</p>
								<p xml:id="_e64847" n="0146">The tag image processing and decoding performed by a sensing device such as the netpage pen is shown in FIG. 7. While a captured image is being acquired from the image
									sensor, the dynamic range of the image is determined (at 20). The center of the range is then chosen as the binary threshold for the image 21. The image is then thresholded and segmented into
									connected pixel regions (i.e. shapes 23) (at 22). Shapes which are too small to represent tag target structures are discarded. The size and centroid of each shape is also computed.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_52f6a9" n="0147">Binary shape moments 25 are then computed (at 24) for each shape, and these provide the basis for subsequently locating target structures. Central shape moments are by
									their nature invariant of position, and can be easily made invariant of scale, aspect ratio and rotation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1f4c58" n="0148">The ring target structure 15 is the first to be located (at 26). A ring has the advantage of being very well behaved when perspective-distorted. Matching proceeds by
									aspect-normalizing and rotation-normalizing each shape's moments. Once its second-order moments are normalized the ring is easy to recognize even if the perspective distortion was
									significant. The ring's original aspect and rotation 27 together provide a useful approximation of the perspective transform.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_91d2ca" n="0149">The axis target structure 16 is the next to be located (at 28). Matching proceeds by applying the ring's normalizations to each shape's moments, and
									rotation-normalizing the resulting moments. Once its second-order moments are normalized the axis target is easily recognized. Note that one third order moment is required to disambiguate the
									two possible orientations of the axis. The shape is deliberately skewed to one side to make this possible. Note also that it is only possible to rotation-normalize the axis target after it
									has had the ring's normalizations applied, since the perspective distortion can hide the axis target's axis. The axis target's original rotation provides a useful approximation of the tag's
									rotation due to pen yaw 29.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b02ffc" n="0150">The four perspective target structures 17 are the last to be located (at 30). Good estimates of their positions are computed based on their known spatial relationships
									to the ring and axis targets, the aspect and rotation of the ring, and the rotation of the axis. Matching proceeds by applying the ring's normalizations to each shape's moments. Once their
									second-order moments are normalized the circular perspective targets are easy to recognize, and the target closest to each estimated position is taken as a match. The original centroids of
									the four perspective targets are then taken to be the perspective-distorted corners 31 of a square of known size in tag space, and an eight-degree-of-freedom perspective transform 33 is
									inferred (at 32) based on solving the well-understood equations relating the four tag-space and image-space point pairs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a57fb8" n="0151">The inferred tag-space to image-space perspective transform is used to project (at 36) each known data bit position in tag space into image space where the real-valued
									position is used to bilinearly interpolate (at 36) the four relevant adjacent pixels in the input image. The previously computed image threshold 21 is used to threshold the result to produce
									the final bit value 37.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_94ece3" n="0152">Once all 360 data bits 37 have been obtained in this way, each of the six 60-bit Reed-Solomon codewords is decoded (at 38) to yield 20 decoded bits 39, or 120 decoded
									bits in total. Note that the codeword symbols are sampled in codeword order, so that codewords are implicitly de-interleaved during the sampling process.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7b4194" n="0153">The ring target 15 is only sought in a subarea of the image whose relationship to the image guarantees that the ring, if found, is part of a complete tag. If a complete
									tag is not found and successfully decoded, then no pen position is recorded for the current frame. Given adequate processing power and ideally a non-minimal field of view 193, an alternative
									strategy involves seeking another tag in the current image.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7c1be3" n="0154">The obtained tag data indicates the identity of the region containing the tag and the position of the tag within the region. An accurate position 35 of the pen nib in
									the region, as well as the overall orientation 35 of the pen, is then inferred (at 34) from the perspective transform 33 observed on the tag and the known spatial relationship between the
									pen's physical axis and the pen's optical axis.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d3d0f6">1.2.6 Tag Map</p>
								<p xml:id="_b62d2b" n="0155">Decoding a tag results in a region ID, a tag ID, and a tag-relative pen transform. Before the tag ID and the tag-relative pen location can be translated into an
									absolute location within the tagged region, the location of the tag within the region must be known. This is given by a tag map, a function which maps each tag ID in a tagged region to a
									corresponding location. The tag map class diagram is shown in FIG. 22, as part of the netpage printer class diagram.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a93dcc" n="0156">A tag map reflects the scheme used to tile the surface region with tags, and this can vary according to surface type. When multiple tagged regions share the same tiling
									scheme and the same tag numbering scheme, they can also share the same tag map.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_98e76d" n="0157">The tag map for a region must be retrievable via the region ID. Thus, given a region ID, a tag ID and a pen transform, the tag map can be retrieved, the tag ID can be
									translated into an absolute tag location within the region, and the tag-relative pen location can be added to the tag location to yield an absolute pen location within the region.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d3a358">1.2.7 Tagging Schemes</p>
								<p xml:id="_fdf6d4" n="0158">Two distinct surface coding schemes are of interest, both of which use the tag structure described earlier in this section. The preferred coding scheme uses
									&quot;location-indicating&quot; tags as already discussed. An alternative coding scheme uses object-indicating tags.</p>
								<p xml:id="_51a5ad" n="0159">A location-indicating tag contains a tag ID which, when translated through the tag map associated with the tagged region, yields a unique tag location within the
									region. The tag-relative location of the pen is added to this tag location to yield the location of the pen within the region. This in turn is used to determine the location of the pen
									relative to a user interface element in the page description associated with the region. Not only is the user interface element itself identified, but a location relative to the user
									interface element is identified. Location-indicating tags therefore trivially support the capture of an absolute pen path in the zone of a particular user interface element.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f4c689" n="0160">An object-indicating tag contains a tag ID which directly identifies a user interface element in the page description associated with the region. All the tags in the
									zone of the user interface element identify the user interface element, making them all identical and therefore indistinguishable. Object-indicating tags do not, therefore, support the
									capture of an absolute pen path. They do, however, support the capture of a relative pen path. So long as the position sampling frequency exceeds twice the encountered tag frequency, the
									displacement from one sampled pen position to the next within a stroke can be unambiguously determined.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6c5b5e" n="0161">With either tagging scheme, the tags function in cooperation with associated visual elements on the netpage as user interactive elements in that a user can interact
									with the printed page using an appropriate sensing device in order for tag data to be read by the sensing device and for an appropriate response to be generated in the netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b4ecf6">1.3 Document and Page Descriptions</p>
								<p xml:id="_48642d" n="0162">A preferred embodiment of a document and page description class diagram is shown in FIGS. 25 and 26.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdb489" n="0163">In the netpage system a document is described at three levels. At the most abstract level the document 836 has a hierarchical structure whose terminal elements 839 are
									associated with content objects 840 such as text objects, text style objects, image objects, etc. Once the document is printed on a printer with a particular page size and according to a
									particular user's scale factor preference, the document is paginated and otherwise formatted. Formatted terminal elements 835 will in some cases be associated with content objects which are
									different from those associated with their corresponding terminal elements, particularly where the content objects are style-related. Each printed instance of a document and page is also
									described separately, to allow input captured through a particular page instance 830 to be recorded separately from input captured through other instances of the same page description.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bcbdba" n="0164">The presence of the most abstract document description on the page server allows a user to request a copy of a document without being forced to accept the source
									document's specific format. The user may be requesting a copy through a printer with a different page size, for example. Conversely, the presence of the formatted document description on the
									page server allows the page server to efficiently interpret user actions on a particular printed page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_912ca5" n="0165">A formatted document 834 consists of a set of formatted page descriptions 5, each of which consists of a set of formatted terminal elements 835. Each formatted element
									has a spatial extent or zone 58 on the page. This defines the active area of input elements such as hyperlinks and input fields.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_64ee08" n="0166">A document instance 831 corresponds to a formatted document 834. It consists of a set of page instances 830, each of which corresponds to a page description 5 of the
									formatted document. Each page instance 830 describes a single unique printed netpage 1, and records the page ID 50 of the netpage. A page instance is not part of a document instance if it
									represents a copy of a page requested in isolation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f487a6" n="0167">A page instance consists of a set of terminal element instances 832. An element instance only exists if it records instance-specific information. Thus, a hyperlink
									instance exists for a hyperlink element because it records a transaction ID 55 which is specific to the page instance, and a field instance exists for a field element because it records input
									specific to the page instance. An element instance does not exist, however, for static elements such as textflows.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a3b41f" n="0168">A terminal element can be a static element 843, a hyperlink element 844, a field element 845 or a page server command element 846, as shown in FIG. 27. A static element
									843 can be a style element 847 with an associated style object 854, a textflow element 848 with an associated styled text object 855, an image element 849 with an associated image element
									856, a graphic element 850 with an associated graphic object 857, a video clip element 851 with an associated video clip object 858, an audio clip element 852 with an associated audio clip
									object 859, or a script element 853 with an associated script object 860, as shown in FIG. 28.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2f3fa3" n="0169">A page instance has a background field 833 which is used to record any digital ink captured on the page which does not apply to a specific input element.</p>
								<p xml:id="_3fc7fa" n="0170">In the preferred form of the invention, a tag map 811 is associated with each page instance to allow tags on the page to be translated into locations on the page.</p>
								<p xml:id="_69f129">1.4 The Netpage Network</p>
								<p xml:id="_249bce" n="0171">In a preferred embodiment, a netpage network consists of a distributed set of netpage page servers 10, netpage registration servers 11, netpage ID servers 12, netpage
									application servers 13, netpage publication servers 14, and netpage printers 601 connected via a network 19 such as the Internet, as shown in FIG. 3.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_790974" n="0172">The netpage registration server 11 is a server which records relationships between users, pens, printers, applications and publications, and thereby authorizes various
									network activities. It authenticates users and acts as a signing proxy on behalf of authenticated users in application transactions. It also provides handwriting recognition services. As
									described above, a netpage page server 10 maintains persistent information about page descriptions and page instances. The netpage network includes any number of page servers, each handling a
									subset of page instances. Since a page server also maintains user input values for each page instance, clients such as netpage printers send netpage input directly to the appropriate page
									server. The page server interprets any such input relative to the description of the corresponding page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_edf5ce" n="0173">A netpage ID server 12 allocates document IDs 51 on demand, and provides load-balancing of page servers via its ID allocation scheme.</p>
								<p xml:id="_2a852c" n="0174">A netpage printer uses the Internet Distributed Name System (DNS), or similar, to resolve a netpage page ID 50 into the network address of the netpage page server
									handling the corresponding page instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a0ef5c" n="0175">A netpage application server 13 is a server which hosts interactive netpage applications. A netpage publication server 14 is an application server which publishes
									netpage documents to netpage printers. They are described in detail in Section 2.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_949c58" n="0176">Netpage servers can be hosted on a variety of network server platforms from manufacturers such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun. Multiple netpage servers can run
									concurrently on a single host, and a single server can be distributed over a number of hosts. Some or all of the functionality provided by netpage servers, and in particular the functionality
									provided by the ID server and the page server, can also be provided directly in a netpage appliance such as a netpage printer, in a computer workstation, or on a local network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f7e6a2">1.5 The Netpage Printer</p>
								<p xml:id="_2809c7" n="0177">The netpage printer 601 is an appliance which is registered with the netpage system and prints netpage documents on demand and via subscription. Each printer has a
									unique printer ID 62, and is connected to the netpage network via a network such as the Internet, ideally via a broadband connection.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bd64ff" n="0178">Apart from identity and security settings in non-volatile memory, the netpage printer contains no persistent storage. As far as a user is concerned, &quot;the network
									is the computer&quot;. Netpages function interactively across space and time with the help of the distributed netpage page servers 10, independently of particular netpage printers.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b08b66" n="0179">The netpage printer receives subscribed netpage documents from netpage publication servers 14. Each document is distributed in two parts: the page layouts, and the
									actual text and image objects which populate the pages. Because of personalization, page layouts are typically specific to a particular subscriber and so are pointcast to the subscriber's
									printer via the appropriate page server. Text and image objects, on the other hand, are typically shared with other subscribers, and so are multicast to all subscribers' printers and the
									appropriate page servers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_cfb3ae" n="0180">The netpage publication server optimizes the segmentation of document content into pointcasts and multicasts. After receiving the pointcast of a document's page
									layouts, the printer knows which multicasts, if any, to listen to.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3015f" n="0181">Once the printer has received the complete page layouts and objects that define the document to be printed, it can print the document.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdf74a" n="0182">The printer rasterizes and prints odd and even pages simultaneously on both sides of the sheet. It contains duplexed print engine controllers 760 and print engines
									utilizing Memjet(TM) printheads 350 for this purpose.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4e28fe" n="0183">The printing process consists of two decoupled stages: rasterization of page descriptions, and expansion and printing of page images. The raster image processor (RIP)
									consists of one or more standard DSPs 757 running in parallel. The duplexed print engine controllers consist of custom processors which expand, dither and print page images in real time,
									synchronized with the operation of the printheads in the print engines.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5ab78b" n="0184">Printers not enabled for IR printing have the option to print tags using IR-absorptive black ink, although this restricts tags to otherwise empty areas of the page.
									Although such pages have more limited functionality than IR-printed pages, they are still classed as netpages.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4c7803" n="0185">A normal netpage printer prints netpages on sheets of paper. More specialised netpage printers may print onto more specialised surfaces, such as globes. Each printer
									supports at least one surface type, and supports at least one tag tiling scheme, and hence tag map, for each surface type. The tag map 811 which describes the tag tiling scheme actually used
									to print a document becomes associated with that document so that the document's tags can be correctly interpreted.

								<p xml:id="_da3a69" n="0202">To enable to production of printers with these characteristics, the present applicant has invented a new print technology, referred to as Memjet(TM) technology.
									Memjet(TM) is a drop-on-demand inkjet technology that incorporates pagewidth printheads fabricated using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. FIG. 17 shows a single printing
									element 300 of a Memjet(TM) printhead. The netpage wallprinter incorporates 168960 printing elements 300 to form a 1600 dpi pagewidth duplex printer. This printer simultaneously prints cyan,
									magenta, yellow, black, and infrared inks as well as paper conditioner and ink fixative.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_dcc13b" n="0203">The printing element 300 is approximately 110 microns long by 32 microns wide. Arrays of these printing elements are formed on a silicon substrate 301 that incorporates
									CMOS logic, data transfer, timing, and drive circuits (not shown).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4edc8c" n="0204">Major elements of the printing element 300 are the nozzle 302, the nozzle rim 303, the nozzle chamber 304, the fluidic seal 305, the ink channel rim 306, the lever arm
									307, the active actuator beam pair 308, the passive actuator beam pair 309, the active actuator anchor 310, the passive actuator anchor 311, and the ink inlet 312.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5bc951" n="0205">The active actuator beam pair 308 is mechanically joined to the passive actuator beam pair 309 at the join 319. Both beams pairs are anchored at their respective anchor
									points 310 and 311. The combination of elements 308, 309, 310, 311, and 319 form a cantilevered electrothermal bend actuator 320.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9cee8e" n="0206">FIG. 18 shows a small part of an array of printing elements 300, including a cross section 315 of a printing element 300. The cross section 315 is shown without ink, to
									clearly show the ink inlet 312 that passes through the silicon wafer 301.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ba5627" n="0207">FIGS. 19(a), 19(b) and 19(c) show the operating cycle of a Memjet(TM) printing element 300.</p>
								<p xml:id="_ac1f17" n="0208">FIG. 19(a) shows the quiescent position of the ink meniscus 316 prior to printing an ink droplet. Ink is retained in the nozzle chamber by surface tension at the ink
									meniscus 316 and at the fluidic seal 305 formed between the nozzle chamber 304 and the ink channel rim 306.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_321381" n="0209">While printing, the printhead CMOS circuitry distributes data from the print engine controller to the correct printing element, latches the data, and buffers the data
									to drive the electrodes 318 of the active actuator beam pair 308. This causes an electrical current to pass through the beam pair 308 for about one microsecond, resulting in Joule heating.
									The temperature increase resulting from Joule heating causes the beam pair 308 to expand. As the passive actuator beam pair 309 is not heated, it does not expand, resulting in a stress
									difference between the two beam pairs. This stress difference is partially resolved by the cantilevered end of the electrothermal bend actuator 320 bending towards the substrate 301. The
									lever arm 307 transmits this movement to the nozzle chamber 304. The nozzle chamber 304 moves about two microns to the position shown in FIG. 19(b). This increases the ink pressure, forcing
									ink 321 out of the nozzle 302, and causing the ink meniscus 316 to bulge. The nozzle rim 303 prevents the ink meniscus 316 from spreading across the surface of the nozzle chamber 304.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_af9781" n="0210">As the temperature of the beam pairs 308 and 309 equalizes, the actuator 320 returns to its original position. This aids in the break-off of the ink droplet 317 from
									the ink 321 in the nozzle chamber, as shown in FIG. 19(c). The nozzle chamber is refilled by the action of the surface tension at the meniscus 316.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e3d44e" n="0211">FIG. 20 shows a segment of a printhead 350. In a netpage printer, the length of the printhead is the full width of the paper (typically 210 mm) in the direction 351.
									The segment shown is 0.4 mm long (about 0.2% of a complete printhead). When printing, the paper is moved past the fixed printhead in the direction 352. The printhead has 6 rows of
									interdigitated printing elements 300, printing the six colors or types of ink supplied by the ink inlets 312.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_36bf38" n="0212">To protect the fragile surface of the printhead during operation, a nozzle guard wafer 330 is attached to the printhead substrate 301. For each nozzle 302 there is a
									corresponding nozzle guard hole 331 through which the ink droplets are fired. To prevent the nozzle guard holes 331 from becoming blocked by paper fibers or other debris, filtered air is
									pumped through the air inlets 332 and out of the nozzle guard holes during printing. To prevent ink 321 from drying, the nozzle guard is sealed while the printer is idle.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a978a3">1.6 The Netpage Pen</p>
								<p xml:id="_684f09" n="0213">The active sensing device of the netpage system is typically a pen 101, which, using its embedded controller 134, is able to capture and decode IR position tags from a
									page via an image sensor. The image sensor is a solid-state device provided with an appropriate filter to permit sensing at only near-infrared wavelengths. As described in more detail below,
									the system is able to sense when the nib is in contact with the surface, and the pen is able to sense tags at a sufficient rate to capture human handwriting (i.e. at 200 dpi or greater and
									100 Hz or faster). Information captured by the pen is encrypted and wirelessly transmitted to the printer (or base station), the printer or base station interpreting the data with respect to
									the (known) page structure.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_58aba1" n="0214">The preferred embodiment of the netpage pen operates both as a normal marking ink pen and as a non-marking stylus. The marking aspect, however, is not necessary for
									using the netpage system as a browsing system, such as when it is used as an Internet interface. Each netpage pen is registered with the netpage system and has a unique pen ID 61. FIG. 23
									shows the netpage pen class diagram, reflecting pen-related information maintained by a registration server 11 on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b37548" n="0215">When either nib is in contact with a netpage, the pen determines its position and orientation relative to the page. The nib is attached to a force sensor, and the force
									on the nib is interpreted relative to a threshold to indicate whether the pen is &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;. This allows a interactive element on the page to be 'clicked' by pressing
									with the pen nib, in order to request, say, information from a network. Furthermore, the force is captured as a continuous value to allow, say, the full dynamics of a signature to be
									verified.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1b87a8" n="0216">The pen determines the position and orientation of its nib on the netpage by imaging, in the infrared spectrum, an area 193of the page in the vicinity of the nib. It
									decodes the nearest tag and computes the position of the nib relative to the tag from the observed perspective distortion on the imaged tag and the known geometry of the pen optics. Although
									the position resolution of the tag may be low, because the tag density on the page is inversely proportional to the tag size, the adjusted position resolution is quite high, exceeding the
									minimum resolution required for accurate handwriting recognition.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef1a67" n="0217">Pen actions relative to a netpage are captured as a series of strokes. A stroke consists of a sequence of time-stamped pen positions on the page, initiated by a
									pen-down event and completed by the subsequent pen-up event. A stroke is also tagged with the page ID 50 of the netpage whenever the page ID changes, which, under normal circumstances, is at
									the commencement of the stroke.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c5550c" n="0218">Each netpage pen has a current selection 826 associated with it, allowing the user to perform copy and paste operations etc. The selection is timestamped to allow the
									system to discard it after a defined time period. The current selection describes a region of a page instance. It consists of the most recent digital ink stroke captured through the pen
									relative to the background area of the page. It is interpreted in an application-specific manner once it is submitted to an application via a selection hyperlink activation.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fb5101" n="0219">Each pen has a current nib 824. This is the nib last notified by the pen to the system. In the case of the default netpage pen described above, either the marking black
									ink nib or the non-marking stylus nib is current. Each pen also has a current nib style 825. This is the nib style last associated with the pen by an application, e.g. in response to the user
									selecting a color from a palette. The default nib style is the nib style associated with the current nib. Strokes captured through a pen are tagged with the current nib style. When the
									strokes are subsequently reproduced, they are reproduced in the nib style with which they are tagged.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_idP" n="0220">Whenever the pen is within range of a printer with which it can communicate, the pen slowly flashes its &quot;online&quot; LED. When the pen fails to decode a stroke
									relative to the page, it momentarily activates its &quot;error&quot; LED. When the pen succeeds in decoding a stroke relative to the page, it momentarily activates its &quot;ok&quot; LED.</p>
								<p xml:id="_014257" n="0221">A sequence of captured strokes is referred to as digital ink. Digital ink forms the basis for the digital exchange of drawings and handwriting, for online recognition
									of handwriting, and for online verification of signatures.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0eaf8f" n="0222">The pen is wireless and transmits digital ink to the netpage printer via a short-range radio link. The transmitted digital ink is encrypted for privacy and security and
									packetized for efficient transmission, but is always flushed on a pen-up event to ensure timely handling in the printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_93dd9e" n="0223">When the pen is out-of-range of a printer it buffers digital ink in internal memory, which has a capacity of over ten minutes of continuous handwriting. When the pen is
									once again within range of a printer, it transfers any buffered digital ink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_355431" n="0224">A pen can be registered with any number of printers, but because all state data resides in netpages both on paper and on the network, it is largely immaterial which
									printer a pen is communicating with at any particular time.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_986091" n="0225">A preferred embodiment of the pen is described in greater detail in Section 6 below, with reference to FIGS. 8 to 10.</p>
								<p xml:id="_82b677">1.7 Netpage Interaction</p>
								<p xml:id="_82b094" n="0226">The netpage printer 601 receives data relating to a stroke from the pen 101 when the pen is used to interact with a netpage 1. The coded data 3 of the tags 4 is read by
									the pen when it is used to execute a movement, such as a stroke. The data allows the identity of the particular page and associated interactive element to be determined and an indication of
									the relative positioning of the pen relative to the page to be obtained. The indicating data is transmitted to the printer, where it resolves, via the DNS, the page ID 50 of the stroke into
									the network address of the netpage page server 10 which maintains the corresponding page instance 830. It then transmits the stroke to the page server. If the page was recently identified in
									an earlier stroke, then the printer may already have the address of the relevant page server in its cache. Each netpage consists of a compact page layout maintained persistently by a netpage
									page server (see below). The page layout refers to objects such as images, fonts and pieces of text, typically stored elsewhere on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e508c2" n="0227">When the page server receives the stroke from the pen, it retrieves the page description to which the stroke applies, and determines which element of the page
									description the stroke intersects. It is then able to interpret the stroke in the context of the type of the relevant element.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3537c4" n="0228">A &quot;click&quot; is a stroke where the distance and time between the pen down position and the subsequent pen up position are both less than some small maximum. An
									object which is activated by a click typically requires a click to be activated, and accordingly, a longer stroke is ignored. The failure of a pen action, such as a &quot;sloppy&quot; click,
									to register is indicated by the lack of response from the pen's &quot;ok&quot; LED.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0c0f0e" n="0229">There are two kinds of input elements in a netpage page description: hyperlinks and form fields. Input through a form field can also trigger the activation of an
									associated hyperlink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c22301">1.7.1 Hyperlinks</p>
								<p xml:id="_c2352b" n="0230">A hyperlink is a means of sending a message to a remote application, and typically elicits a printed response in the netpage system.</p>
								<p xml:id="_d9af7e" n="0231">A hyperlink element 844 identifies the application 71 which handles activation of the hyperlink, a link ID 54 which identifies the hyperlink to the application, an
									&quot;alias required&quot; flag which asks the system to include the user's application alias ID 65 in the hyperlink activation, and a description which is used when the hyperlink is recorded
									as a favorite or appears in the user's history. The hyperlink element class diagram is shown in FIG. 29.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_621612" n="0232">When a hyperlink is activated, the page server sends a request to an application somewhere on the network. The application is identified by an application ID 64, and
									the application ID is resolved in the normal way via the DNS. There are three types of hyperlinks: general hyperlinks 863, form hyperlinks 865, and selection hyperlinks 864, as shown in FIG.
									30. A general hyperlink can implement a request for a linked document, or may simply signal a preference to a server. A form hyperlink submits the corresponding form to the application. A
									selection hyperlink submits the current selection to the application. If the current selection contains a single-word piece of text, for example, the application may return a single-page
									document giving the word's meaning within the context in which it appears, or a translation into a different language. Each hyperlink type is characterized by what information is submitted to
									the application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_de6e28" n="0233">The corresponding hyperlink instance 862 records a transaction ID 55 which can be specific to the page instance on which the hyperlink instance appears. The transaction
									ID can identify user-specific data to the application, for example a &quot;shopping cart&quot; of pending purchases maintained by a purchasing application on behalf of the user.</p>
								<p xml:id="_3ad090" n="0234">The system includes the pen's current selection 826 in a selection hyperlink activation. The system includes the content of the associated form instance 868 in a form
									hyperlink activation, although if the hyperlink has its &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute set, only input since the last form submission is included. The system includes an effective return
									path in all hyperlink activations.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_050424" n="0235">A hyperlinked group 866 is a group element 838 which has an associated hyperlink, as shown in FIG. 31. When input occurs through any field element in the group, the
									hyperlink 844 associated with the group is activated. A hyperlinked group can be used to associate hyperlink behavior with a field such as a checkbox. It can also be used, in conjunction with
									the &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute of a form hyperlink, to provide continuous input to an application. It can therefore be used to support a &quot;blackboard&quot; interaction model, i.e.
									where input is captured and therefore shared as soon as it occurs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_444c19">1.7.2 Forms</p>
								<p xml:id="_09c48e" n="0236">A form defines a collection of related input fields used to capture a related set of inputs through a printed netpage. A form allows a user to submit one or more
									parameters to an application software program running on a server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_19d361" n="0237">A form 867 is a group element 838 in the document hierarchy. It ultimately contains a set of terminal field elements 839. A form instance 868 represents a printed
									instance of a form. It consists of a set of field instances 870 which correspond to the field elements 845 of the form. Each field instance has an associated value 871, whose type depends on
									the type of the corresponding field element. Each field value records input through a particular printed form instance, i.e. through one or more printed netpages. The form class diagram is
									shown in FIG. 32.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_220200" n="0238">Each form instance has a status 872 which indicates whether the form is active, frozen, submitted, void or expired. A form is active when first printed. A form becomes
									frozen once it is signed. A form becomes submitted once one of its submission hyperlinks has been activated, unless the hyperlink has its &quot;submit delta&quot; attribute set. A form
									becomes void when the user invokes a void form, reset form or duplicate form page command. A form expires when the time the form has been active exceeds the form's specified lifetime. While
									the form is active, form input is allowed. Input through a form which is not active is instead captured in the background field 833 of the relevant page instance. When the form is active or
									frozen, form submission is allowed. Any attempt to submit a form when the form is not active or frozen is rejected, and instead elicits an form status report.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a1292" n="0239">Each form instance is associated (at 59) with any form instances derived from it, thus providing a version history. This allows all but the latest version of a form in
									a particular time period to be excluded from a search.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d65d72" n="0240">All input is captured as digital ink. Digital ink 873 consists of a set of timestamped stroke groups 874, each of which consists of a set of styled strokes 875. Each
									stroke consists of a set of timestamped pen positions 876, each of which also includes pen orientation and nib force. The digital ink class diagram is shown in FIG. 33.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdee2f" n="0241">A field element 845 can be a checkbox field 877, a text field 878, a drawing field 879, or a signature field 880. The field element class diagram is shown in FIG. 34.
									Any digital ink captured in a field's zone 58 is assigned to the field.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef2dad" n="0242">A checkbox field has an associated boolean value 881, as shown in FIG. 35. Any mark (a tick, a cross, a stroke, a fill zigzag, etc.) captured in a checkbox field's zone
									causes a true value to be assigned to the field's value.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d19e45" n="0243">A text field has an associated text value 882, as shown in FIG. 36. Any digital ink captured in a text field's zone is automatically converted to text via online
									handwriting recognition, and the text is assigned to the field's value. Online handwriting recognition is well-understood (see for example Tappert, C., C. Y. Suen and T. Wakahara, &quot;The
									State of the Art in On-Line Handwriting Recognition&quot;, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 12, No. 8, August 1990).</p>
								<p xml:id="_be4a8f" n="0244">A signature field has an associated digital signature value 883, as shown in FIG. 37. Any digital ink captured in a signature field's zone is automatically verified
									with respect to the identity of the owner of the pen, and a digital signature of the content of the form of which the field is part is generated and assigned to the field's value. The digital
									signature is generated using the pen user's private signature key specific to the application which owns the form. Online signature verification is well-understood (see for example Plamondon,
									R. and G. Lorette, &quot;Automatic Signature Verification and Writer Identification-The State of the Art&quot;, Pattern Recognition, Vol. 22, No. 2, 1989).</p>
								<p xml:id="_d88b12" n="0245">A field element is hidden if its &quot;hidden&quot; attribute is set. A hidden field element does not have an input zone on a page and does not accept input. It can
									have an associated field value which is included in the form data when the form containing the field is submitted.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c4e519" n="0246">&quot;Editing&quot; commands, such as strike-throughs indicating deletion, can also be recognized in form fields.</p>
								<p xml:id="_c6456f" n="0247">Because the handwriting recognition algorithm works &quot;online&quot; (i.e. with access to the dynamics of the pen movement), rather than &quot;offline&quot; (i.e.
									with access only to a bitmap of pen markings), it can recognize run-on discretely-written characters with relatively high accuracy, without a writer-dependent training phase. A
									writer-dependent model of handwriting is automatically generated over time, however, and can be generated up-front if necessary,
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ae0bb7" n="0248">Digital ink, as already stated, consists of a sequence of strokes. Any stroke which starts in a particular element's zone is appended to that element's digital ink
									stream, ready for interpretation. Any stroke not appended to an object's digital ink stream is appended to the background field's digital ink stream.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_62ea2e" n="0249">Digital ink captured in the background field is interpreted as a selection gesture. Circumscription of one or more objects is generally interpreted as a selection of
									the circumscribed objects, although the actual interpretation is application-specific.

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_461fe9" n="0252">The raw digital ink captured in every field is retained on the netpage page server and is optionally transmitted with the form data when the form is submitted to the
									application. This allows the application to interrogate the raw digital ink should it suspect the original conversion, such as the conversion of handwritten text. This can, for example,
									involve human intervention at the application level for forms which fail certain application-specific consistency checks. As an extension to this, the entire background area of a form can be
									designated as a drawing field. The application can then decide, on the basis of the presence of digital ink outside the explicit fields of the form, to route the form to a human operator, on
									the assumption that the user may have indicated amendments to the filled-in fields outside of those fields.

								<p xml:id="_9850ad" n="0253">FIG. 38 shows a flowchart of the process of handling pen input relative to a netpage. The process consists of receiving (at 884) a stroke from the pen; identifying (at

									intersects; determining (at 888) whether the formatted element corresponds to a field element, and if so appending (at 892) the received stroke to the digital ink of the field value 871,
									interpreting (at 893) the accumulated digital ink of the field, and determining (at 894) whether the field is part of a hyperlinked group 866 and if so activating (at 895) the associated
									hyperlink; alternatively determining (at 889) whether the formatted element corresponds to a hyperlink element and if so activating (at 895) the corresponding hyperlink; alternatively, in the
									absence of an input field or hyperlink, appending (at 890) the received stroke to the digital ink of the background field 833; and copying (at 891) the received stroke to the current

								<p xml:id="_eba98a">1.7.3 Page Server Commands</p>
								<p xml:id="_a73a04" n="0255">A page server command is a command which is handled locally by the page server. It operates directly on form, page and document instances.</p>
								<p xml:id="_bc0b68" n="0256">A page server command 907 can be a void form command 908, a duplicate form command 909, a reset form command 910, a get form status command 911, a duplicate page
									command 912, a reset page command 913, a get page status command 914, a duplicate document command 915, a reset document command 916, or a get document status command 917, as shown in FIG.
									39.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_16a8fc" n="0257">A void form command voids the corresponding form instance. A duplicate form command voids the corresponding form instance and then produces an active printed copy of
									the current form instance with field values preserved. The copy contains the same hyperlink transaction IDs as the original, and so is indistinguishable from the original to an application. A
									reset form command voids the corresponding form instance and then produces an active printed copy of the form instance with field values discarded. A get form status command produces a
									printed report on the status of the corresponding form instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the form status of the form instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_59e27a" n="0258">Since a form hyperlink instance contains a transaction ID, the application has to be involved in producing a new form instance. A button requesting a new form instance
									is therefore typically implemented as a hyperlink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7c20e9" n="0259">A duplicate page command produces a printed copy of the corresponding page instance with the background field value preserved. If the page contains a form or is part of
									a form, then the duplicate page command is interpreted as a duplicate form command. A reset page command produces a printed copy of the corresponding page instance with the background field
									value discarded. If the page contains a form or is part of a form, then the reset page command is interpreted as a reset form command. A get page status command produces a printed report on
									the status of the corresponding page instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the status of any forms it contains or is part of.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f4659b" n="0260">The netpage logo which appears on every netpage is usually associated with a duplicate page element.</p>
								<p xml:id="_1d8f0e" n="0261">When a page instance is duplicated with field values preserved, field values are printed in their native form, i.e. a checkmark appears as a standard checkmark graphic,
									and text appears as typeset text. Only drawings and signatures appear in their original form, with a signature accompanied by a standard graphic indicating successful signature verification.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_896c70" n="0262">A duplicate document command produces a printed copy of the corresponding document instance with background field values preserved. If the document contains any forms,
									then the duplicate document command duplicates the forms in the same way a duplicate form command does. A reset document command produces a printed copy of the corresponding document instance
									with background field values discarded. If the document contains any forms, then the reset document command resets the forms in the same way a reset form command does. A get document status
									command produces a printed report on the status of the corresponding document instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the status of any forms
									it contains.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0ebce0" n="0263">If the page server command's &quot;on selected&quot; attribute is set, then the command operates on the page identified by the pen's current selection rather than on
									the page containing the command. This allows a menu of page server commands to be printed. If the target page doesn't contain a page server command element for the designated page server
									command, then the command is ignored.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_66c0d8" n="0264">An application can provide application-specific handling by embedding the relevant page server command element in a hyperlinked group. The page server activates the
									hyperlink associated with the hyperlinked group rather than executing the page server command.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c9cb3f" n="0265">A page server command element is hidden if its &quot;hidden&quot; attribute is set. A hidden command element does not have an input zone on a page and so cannot be
									activated directly by a user. It can, however, be activated via a page server command embedded in a different page, if that page server command has its &quot;on selected&quot; attribute set.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f228a6">1.8 Standard Features of Netpages</p>
								<p xml:id="_cdf0dc" n="0266">In the preferred form, each netpage is printed with the netpage logo at the bottom to indicate that it is a netpage and therefore has interactive properties. The logo
									also acts as a copy button. In most cases pressing the logo produces a copy of the page. In the case of a form, the button produces a copy of the entire form. And in the case of a secure
									document, such as a ticket or coupon, the button elicits an explanatory note or advertising page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1e47cf" n="0267">The default single-page copy function is handled directly by the relevant netpage page server. Special copy functions are handled by linking the logo button to an
									application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9f1c5c">1.9 User Help System</p>
								<p xml:id="_5da2f9" n="0268">In a preferred embodiment, the netpage printer has a single button labelled &quot;Help&quot;. When pressed it elicits a single page of information, including:</p>
								<p xml:id="_7f29f3" n="0269">status of printer connection</p>
								<p xml:id="_822f14" n="0270">status of printer consumables</p>
								<p xml:id="_1c55e1" n="0271">top-level help menu</p>
								<p xml:id="_9c6f51" n="0272">document function menu</p>
								<p xml:id="_e081f1" n="0273">top-level netpage network directory</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3db5d" n="0274">The help menu provides a hierarchical manual on how to use the netpage system.</p>
								<p xml:id="_7dd785" n="0275">The document function menu includes the following functions:</p>
								<p xml:id="_903d27" n="0276">print a copy of a document</p>
								<p xml:id="_ba41c3" n="0277">print a clean copy of a form</p>
								<p xml:id="_b6efe8" n="0278">print the status of a document</p>
								<p xml:id="_0807ff" n="0279">A document function is initiated by simply pressing the button and then touching any page of the document. The status of a document indicates who published it and when,
									to whom it was delivered, and to whom and when it was subsequently submitted as a form.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b44807" n="0280">The netpage network directory allows the user to navigate the hierarchy of publications and services on the network. As an alternative, the user can call the netpage
									network &quot;900&quot; number &quot;yellow pages&quot; and speak to a human operator. The operator can locate the desired document and route it to the user's printer. Depending on the
									document type, the publisher or the user pays the small &quot;yellow pages&quot; service fee.</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a7bad" n="0281">The help page is obviously unavailable if the printer is unable to print. In this case the &quot;error&quot; light is lit and the user can request remote diagnosis over
									the network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d62616">2 Personalized Publication Model</p>
								<p xml:id="_af575a" n="0282">In the following description, news is used as a canonical publication example to illustrate personalization mechanisms in the netpage system. Although news is often
									used in the limited sense of newspaper and newsmagazine news, the intended scope in the present context is wider.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_77e429" n="0283">In the netpage system, the editorial content and the advertising content of a news publication are personalized using different mechanisms. The editorial content is
									personalized according to the reader's explicitly stated and implicitly captured interest profile. The advertising content is personalized according to the reader's locality and demographic.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_654b2a">2.1 Editorial Personalization</p>
								<p xml:id="_fe217d" n="0284">A subscriber can draw on two kinds of news sources: those that deliver news publications, and those that deliver news streams. While news publications are aggregated
									and edited by the publisher, news streams are aggregated either by a news publisher or by a specialized news aggregator. News publications typically correspond to traditional newspapers and
									newsmagazines, while news streams can be many and varied: a &quot;raw&quot; news feed from a news service, a cartoon strip, a freelance writer's column, a friend's bulletin board, or the
									reader's own e-mail.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_630e53" n="0285">The netpage publication server supports the publication of edited news publications as well as the aggregation of multiple news streams. By handling the aggregation and
									hence the formatting of news streams selected directly by the reader, the server is able to place advertising on pages over which it otherwise has no editorial control.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1592d2" n="0286">The subscriber builds a daily newspaper by selecting one or more contributing news publications, and creating a personalized version of each. The resulting daily
									editions are printed and bound together into a single newspaper. The various members of a household typically express their different interests and tastes by selecting different daily
									publications and then customizing them.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aecce0" n="0287">For each publication, the reader optionally selects specific sections. Some sections appear daily, while others appear weekly. The daily sections available from The New
									York Times online, for example, include &quot;Page One Plus&quot;, &quot;National&quot;, &quot;International&quot;, &quot;Opinion&quot;, &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Arts/Living&quot;,
									&quot;Technology&quot;, and &quot;Sports&quot;. The set of available sections is specific to a publication, as is the default subset.</p>
								<p xml:id="_051aca" n="0288">The reader can extend the daily newspaper by creating custom sections, each one drawing on any number of news streams. Custom sections might be created for e-mail and
									friends' announcements (&quot;Personal&quot;), or for monitoring news feeds for specific topics (&quot;Alerts&quot; or &quot;Clippings&quot;).</p>
								<p xml:id="_92c533" n="0289">For each section, the reader optionally specifies its size, either qualitatively (e.g. short, medium, or long), or numerically (i.e. as a limit on its number of pages),
									and the desired proportion of advertising, either qualitatively (e.g. high, normal, low, none), or numerically (i.e. as a percentage).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_becd46" n="0290">The reader also optionally expresses a preference for a large number of shorter articles or a small number of longer articles. Each article is ideally written (or
									edited) in both short and long forms to support this preference.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_14698a" n="0291">An article may also be written (or edited) in different versions to match the expected sophistication of the reader, for example to provide children's and adults'
									versions. The appropriate version is selected according to the reader's age. The reader can specify a &quot;reading age&quot; which takes precedence over their biological age.</p>
								<p xml:id="_98e608" n="0292">The articles which make up each section are selected and prioritized by the editors, and each is assigned a useful lifetime. By default they are delivered to all
									relevant subscribers, in priority order, subject to space constraints in the subscribers' editions.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f5a9f6" n="0293">In sections where it is appropriate, the reader may optionally enable collaborative filtering. This is then applied to articles which have a sufficiently long lifetime.
									Each article which qualifies for collaborative filtering is printed with rating buttons at the end of the article. The buttons can provide an easy choice (e.g. &quot;liked&quot; and
									&quot;disliked&quot;), making it more likely that readers will bother to rate the article.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b171b9" n="0294">Articles with high priorities and short lifetimes are therefore effectively considered essential reading by the editors and are delivered to most relevant subscribers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1bc0ef" n="0295">The reader optionally specifies a serendipity factor, either qualitatively (e.g. do or don't surprise me), or numerically. A high serendipity factor lowers the
									threshold used for matching during collaborative filtering. A high factor makes it more likely that the corresponding section will be filled to the reader's specified capacity. A different
									serendipity factor can be specified for different days of the week.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d4fe85" n="0296">The reader also optionally specifies topics of particular interest within a section, and this modifies the priorities assigned by the editors.</p>
								<p xml:id="_430936" n="0297">The speed of the reader's Internet connection affects the quality at which images can be delivered. The reader optionally specifies a preference for fewer images or
									smaller images or both. If the number or size of images is not reduced, then images may be delivered at lower quality (i.e. at lower resolution or with greater compression).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d65e25" n="0298">At a global level, the reader specifies how quantities, dates, times and monetary values are localized. This involves specifying whether units are imperial or metric, a
									local timezone and time format, and a local currency, and whether the localization consist of in situ translation or annotation. These preferences are derived from the reader's locality by
									default.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fede65" n="0299">To reduce reading difficulties caused by poor eyesight, the reader optionally specifies a global preference for a larger presentation. Both text and images are scaled
									accordingly, and less information is accommodated on each page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a51deb" n="0300">The language in which a news publication is published, and its corresponding text encoding, is a property of the publication and not a preference expressed by the user.
									However, the netpage system can be configured to provide automatic translation services in various guises.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d24b52">2.2 Advertising Localization and Targeting</p>
								<p xml:id="_5448c6" n="0301">The personalization of the editorial content directly affects the advertising content, because advertising is typically placed to exploit the editorial context. Travel
									ads, for example, are more likely to appear in a travel section than elsewhere. The value of the editorial content to an advertiser (and therefore to the publisher) lies in its ability to
									attract large numbers of readers with the right demographics.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ceadcc" n="0302">Effective advertising is placed on the basis of locality and demographics. Locality determines proximity to particular services, retailers etc., and particular
									interests and concerns associated with the local community and environment. Demographics determine general interests and preoccupations as well as likely spending patterns.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f1a62a" n="0303">A news publisher's most profitable product is advertising &quot;space&quot;, a multi-dimensional entity determined by the publication's geographic coverage, the size of
									its readership, its readership demographics, and the page area available for advertising.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3ab7ba" n="0304">In the netpage system, the netpage publication server computes the approximate multi-dimensional size of a publication's saleable advertising space on a per-section
									basis, taking into account the publication's geographic coverage, the section's readership, the size of each reader's section edition, each reader's advertising proportion, and each reader's
									demographic.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_865bf3" n="0305">In comparison with other media, the netpage system allows the advertising space to be defined in greater detail, and allows smaller pieces of it to be sold separately.
									It therefore allows it to be sold at closer to its true value.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f59bb5" n="0306">For example, the same advertising &quot;slot&quot; can be sold in varying proportions to several advertisers, with individual readers' pages randomly receiving the
									advertisement of one advertiser or another, overall preserving the proportion of space sold to each advertiser.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_11b57f" n="0307">The netpage system allows advertising to be linked directly to detailed product information and online purchasing. It therefore raises the intrinsic value of the
									advertising space.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbc07b" n="0308">Because personalization and localization are handled automatically by netpage publication servers, an advertising aggregator can provide arbitrarily broad coverage of
									both geography and demographics. The subsequent disaggregation is efficient because it is automatic. This makes it more cost-effective for publishers to deal with advertising aggregators than
									to directly capture advertising. Even though the advertising aggregator is taking a proportion of advertising revenue, publishers may find the change profit-neutral because of the greater
									efficiency of aggregation. The advertising aggregator acts as an intermediary between advertisers and publishers, and may place the same advertisement in multiple publications.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9ef994" n="0309">It is worth noting that ad placement in a netpage publication can be more complex than ad placement in the publication's traditional counterpart, because the
									publication's advertising space is more complex. While ignoring the full complexities of negotiations between advertisers, advertising aggregators and publishers, the preferred form of the
									netpage system provides some automated support for these negotiations, including support for automated auctions of advertising space. Automation is particularly desirable for the placement of
									advertisements which generate small amounts of income, such as small or highly localized advertisements.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ed91b3" n="0310">Once placement has been negotiated, the aggregator captures and edits the advertisement and records it on a netpage ad server. Correspondingly, the publisher records
									the ad placement on the relevant netpage publication server. When the netpage publication server lays out each user's personalized publication, it picks the relevant advertisements from the
									netpage ad server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_23ae19">2.3 User Profiles</p>
								<p xml:id="_dcf36d">2.3.1 Information Filtering</p>
								<p xml:id="_3a8999" n="0311">The personalization of news and other publications relies on an assortment of user-specific profile information, including:</p>
								<p xml:id="_78c0ea" n="0312">publication customizations</p>
								<p xml:id="_b529c2" n="0313">collaborative filtering vectors</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f5aee" n="0314">contact details</p>
								<p xml:id="_edd7e4" n="0315">presentation preferences</p>
								<p xml:id="_0adfd4" n="0316">The customization of a publication is typically publication-specific, and so the customization information is maintained by the relevant netpage publication server.</p>
								<p xml:id="_fcbd92" n="0317">A collaborative filtering vector consists of the user's ratings of a number of news items. It is used to correlate different users' interests for the purposes of making
									recommendations. Although there are benefits to maintaining a single collaborative filtering vector independently of any particular publication, there are two reasons why it is more practical
									to maintain a separate vector for each publication: there is likely to be more overlap between the vectors of subscribers to the same publication than between those of subscribers to
									different publications; and a publication is likely to want to present its users' collaborative filtering vectors as part of the value of its brand, not to be found elsewhere. Collaborative
									filtering vectors are therefore also maintained by the relevant netpage publication server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4c7536" n="0318">Contact details, including name, street address, ZIP Code, state, country, telephone numbers, are global by nature, and are maintained by a netpage registration server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ec69e0" n="0319">Presentation preferences, including those for quantities, dates and times, are likewise global and maintained in the same way.</p>
								<p xml:id="_f1bf81" n="0320">The localization of advertising relies on the locality indicated in the user's contact details, while the targeting of advertising relies on personal information such
									as date of birth, gender, marital status, income, profession, education, or qualitative derivatives such as age range and income range.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5f5edc" n="0321">For those users who choose to reveal personal information for advertising purposes, the information is maintained by the relevant netpage registration server. In the
									absence of such information, advertising can be targeted on the basis of the demographic associated with the user's ZIP or ZIP+4 Code.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e4cc66" n="0322">Each user, pen, printer, application provider and application is assigned its own unique identifier, and the netpage registration server maintains the relationships
									between them, as shown in FIGS. 21, 22, 23 and 24. For registration purposes, a publisher is a special kind of application provider, and a publication is a special kind of application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_92e641" n="0323">Each user 800 may be authorized to use any number of printers 802, and each printer may allow any number of users to use it. Each user has a single default printer (at
									66), to which periodical publications are delivered by default, whilst pages printed on demand are delivered to the printer through which the user is interacting. The server keeps track of
									which publishers a user has authorized to print to the user's default printer. A publisher does not record the ID of any particular printer, but instead resolves the ID when it is required.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4c5140" n="0324">When a user subscribes 808 to a publication 807, the publisher 806 (i.e. application provider 803) is authorized to print to a specified printer or the user's default
									printer. This authorization can be revoked at any time by the user. Each user may have several pens 801, but a pen is specific to a single user. If a user is authorized to use a particular
									printer, then that printer recognizes any of the user's pens.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_70db8b" n="0325">The pen ID is used to locate the corresponding user profile maintained by a particular netpage registration server, via the DNS in the usual way.</p>
								<p xml:id="_aba516" n="0326">A Web terminal 809 can be authorized to print on a particular netpage printer, allowing Web pages and netpage documents encountered during Web browsing to be
									conveniently printed on the nearest netpage printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6486ba" n="0327">The netpage system can collect, on behalf of a printer provider, fees and commissions on income earned through publications printed on the provider's printers. Such
									income can include advertising fees, click-through fees, e-commerce commissions, and transaction fees. If the printer is owned by the user, then the user is the printer provider.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ec5919" n="0328">Each user also has a netpage account 820 which is used to accumulate micro-debits and credits (such as those described in the preceding paragraph); contact details 815,
									including name, address and telephone numbers; global preferences 816, including privacy, delivery and localization settings; any number of biometric records 817, containing the user's
									encoded signature 818, fingerprint 819 etc; a handwriting model 819 automatically maintained by the system; and SET payment card accounts 821 with which e-commerce payments can be made.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9991a8">2.3.2 Favorites List</p>
								<p xml:id="_b245fb" n="0329">A netpage user can maintain a list 922 of &quot;favorites&quot;-links to useful documents etc. on the netpage network. The list is maintained by the system on the
									user's behalf It is organized as a hierarchy of folders 924, a preferrred embodiment of which is shown in the class diagram in FIG. 41.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a5dec3">2.3.3 History List</p>
								<p xml:id="_559bbe" n="0330">The system maintains a history list 929 on each user's behalf, containing links to documents etc. accessed by the user through the netpage system. It is organized as a
									date-ordered list, a preferred embodiment of which is shown in the class diagram in FIG. 42.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_09a75f">2.4 Intelligent Page Layout</p>
								<p xml:id="_76f517" n="0331">The netpage publication server automatically lays out the pages of each user's personalized publication on a section-by-section basis. Since most advertisements are in
									the form of pre-formatted rectangles, they are placed on the page before the editorial content.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0260b6" n="0332">The advertising ratio for a section can be achieved with wildly varying advertising ratios on individual pages within the section, and the ad layout algorithm exploits
									this. The algorithm is configured to attempt to co-locate closely tied editorial and advertising content, such as placing ads for roofing material specifically within the publication because
									of a special feature on do-it-yourself roofing repairs.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0017eb" n="0333">The editorial content selected for the user, including text and associated images and graphics, is then laid out according to various aesthetic rules.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a374c1" n="0334">The entire process, including the selection of ads and the selection of editorial content, must be iterated once the layout has converged, to attempt to more closely
									achieve the user's stated section size preference. The section size preference can, however, be matched on average over time, allowing significant day-to-day variations.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0db30b">2.5 Document Format</p>
								<p xml:id="_f8e58a" n="0335">Once the document is laid out, it is encoded for efficient distribution and persistent storage on the netpage network.</p>
								<p xml:id="_fd2c88" n="0336">The primary efficiency mechanism is the separation of information specific to a single user's edition and information shared between multiple users' editions. The
									specific information consists of the page layout. The shared information consists of the objects to which the page layout refers, including images, graphics, and pieces of text.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b9becf" n="0337">A text object contains fully-formatted text represented in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) using the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). XSL provides precise
									control over text formatting independently of the region into which the text is being set, which in this case is being provided by the layout. The text object contains embedded language codes
									to enable automatic translation, and embedded hyphenation hints to aid with paragraph formatting.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_788564" n="0338">An image object encodes an image in the JPEG 2000 wavelet-based compressed image format. A graphic object encodes a 2D graphic in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3a6e9c" n="0339">
									The layout itself consists of a series of placed image and graphic objects, linked textflow objects through which text objects flow, hyperlinks and input fields as described above, and
									watermark regions. These layout objects are summarized in Table 3. The layout uses a compact format suitable for efficient distribution and storage.

								<p xml:id="_c99a91" n="0340">As described above, for purposes of efficient distribution and persistent storage on the netpage network, a user-specific page layout is separated from the shared
									objects to which it refers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_756bee" n="0341">When a subscribed publication is ready to be distributed, the netpage publication server allocates, with the help of the netpage ID server 12, a unique ID for each
									page, page instance, document, and document instance.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bee7a6" n="0342">The server computes a set of optimized subsets of the shared content and creates a multicast channel for each subset, and then tags each user-specific layout with the
									names of the multicast channels which will carry the shared content used by that layout. The server then pointcasts each user's layouts to that user's printer via the appropriate page server,
									and when the pointcasting is complete, multicasts the shared content on the specified channels. After receiving its pointcast, each page server and printer subscribes to the multicast
									channels specified in the page layouts. During the multicasts, each page server and printer extracts from the multicast streams those objects referred to by its page layouts. The page servers
									persistently archive the received page layouts and shared content.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b33be1" n="0343">Once a printer has received all the objects to which its page layouts refer, the printer re-creates the fully-populated layout and then rasterizes and prints it.</p>
								<p xml:id="_0415eb" n="0344">Under normal circumstances, the printer prints pages faster than they can be delivered. Assuming a quarter of each page is covered with images, the average page has a
									size of less than 400 KB. The printer can therefore hold in excess of 100 such pages in its internal 64 MB memory, allowing for temporary buffers etc. The printer prints at a rate of one page
									per second. This is equivalent to 400 KB or about 3 Mbit of page data per second, which is similar to the highest expected rate of page data delivery over a broadband network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f93fa9" n="0345">Even under abnormal circumstances, such as when the printer runs out of paper, it is likely that the user will be able to replenish the paper supply before the
									printer's 100-page internal storage capacity is exhausted.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_41a7a0" n="0346">However, if the printer's internal memory does fill up, then the printer will be unable to make use of a multicast when it first occurs. The netpage publication server
									therefore allows printers to submit requests for re-multicasts. When a critical number of requests is received or a timeout occurs, the server re-multicasts the corresponding shared objects.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_883f94" n="0347">Once a document is printed, a printer can produce an exact duplicate at any time by retrieving its page layouts and contents from the relevant page server.</p>
								<p xml:id="_eb9e70">2.7 On-Demand Documents</p>
								<p xml:id="_df43b3" n="0348">When a netpage document is requested on demand, it can be personalized and delivered in much the same way as a periodical. However, since there is no shared content,
									delivery is made directly to the requesting printer without the use of multicast.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1588c9" n="0349">When a non-netpage document is requested on demand, it is not personalized, and it is delivered via a designated netpage formatting server which reformats it as a
									netpage document. A netpage formatting server is a special instance of a netpage publication server. The netpage formatting server has knowledge of various Internet document formats,
									including Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In the case of HTML, it can make use of the higher resolution of the printed page to present Web pages
									in a multi-column format, with a table of contents. It can automatically include all Web pages directly linked to the requested page. The user can tune this behavior via a preference.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_17dd33" n="0350">The netpage formatting server makes standard netpage behavior, including interactivity and persistence, available on any Internet document, no matter what its origin
									and format. It hides knowledge of different document formats from both the netpage printer and the netpage page server, and hides knowledge of the netpage system from Web servers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_864685">3 Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_6bda41">3.1 Cryptography</p>
								<p xml:id="_955228" n="0351">Cryptography is used to protect sensitive information, both in storage and in transit, and to authenticate parties to a transaction. There are two classes of
									cryptography in widespread use: secret-key cryptography and public-key cryptography. The netpage network uses both classes of cryptography.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_86f37d" n="0352">Secret-key cryptography, also referred to as symmetric cryptography, uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. Two parties wishing to exchange messages must
									first arrange to securely exchange the secret key.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_cd6a32" n="0353">Public-key cryptography, also referred to as asymmetric cryptography, uses two encryption keys. The two keys are mathematically related in such a way that any message
									encrypted using one key can only be decrypted using the other key. One of these keys is then published, while the other is kept private. The public key is used to encrypt any message intended
									for the holder of the private key. Once encrypted using the public key, a message can only be decrypted using the private key. Thus two parties can securely exchange messages without first
									having to exchange a secret key. To ensure that the private key is secure, it is normal for the holder of the private key to generate the key pair.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e2acc3" n="0354">Public-key cryptography can be used to create a digital signature. The holder of the private key can create a known hash of a message and then encrypt the hash using
									the private key. Anyone can then verify that the encrypted hash constitutes the &quot;signature&quot; of the holder of the private key with respect to that particular message by decrypting
									the encrypted hash using the public key and verifying the hash against the message. If the signature is appended to the message, then the recipient of the message can verify both that the
									message is genuine and that it has not been altered in transit.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_12c197" n="0355">To make public-key cryptography work, there has to be a way to distribute public keys which prevents impersonation. This is normally done using certificates and
									certificate authorities. A certificate authority is a trusted third party which authenticates the connection between a public key and someone's identity. The certificate authority verifies
									the person's identity by examining identity documents, and then creates and signs a digital certificate containing the person's identity details and public key. Anyone who trusts the
									certificate authority can use the public key in the certificate with a high degree of certainty that it is genuine. They just have to verify that the certificate has indeed been signed by the
									certificate authority, whose public key is well-known.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_de9df7" n="0356">In most transaction environments, public-key cryptography is only used to create digital signatures and to securely exchange secret session keys. Secret-key
									cryptography is used for all other purposes.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_32fdfa" n="0357">In the following discussion, when reference is made to the secure transmission of information between a netpage printer and a server, what actually happens is that the
									printer obtains the server's certificate, authenticates it with reference to the certificate authority, uses the public key-exchange key in the certificate to exchange a secret session key
									with the server, and then uses the secret session key to encrypt the message data. A session key, by definition, can have an arbitrarily short lifetime.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_828eee">3.2 Netpage Printer Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_00b2d4" n="0358">Each netpage printer is assigned a pair of unique identifiers at time of manufacture which are stored in read-only memory in the printer and in the netpage registration
									server database. The first ID 62 is public and uniquely identifies the printer on the netpage network. The second ID is secret and is used when the printer is first registered on the network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_611ce4" n="0359">When the printer connects to the netpage network for the first time after installation, it creates a signature public/private key pair. It transmits the secret ID and
									the public key securely to the netpage registration server. The server compares the secret ID against the printer's secret ID recorded in its database, and accepts the registration if the IDs
									match. It then creates and signs a certificate containing the printer's public ID and public signature key, and stores the certificate in the registration database.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_00599b" n="0360">The netpage registration server acts as a certificate authority for netpage printers, since it has access to secret information allowing it to verify printer identity.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bb2c91" n="0361">When a user subscribes to a publication, a record is created in the netpage registration server database authorizing the publisher to print the publication to the
									user's default printer or a specified printer. Every document sent to a printer via a page server is addressed to a particular user and is signed by the publisher using the publisher's
									private signature key. The page server verifies, via the registration database, that the publisher is authorized to deliver the publication to the specified user. The page server verifies the
									signature using the publisher's public key, obtained from the publisher's certificate stored in the registration database.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b55ed1" n="0362">The netpage registration server accepts requests to add printing authorizations to the database, so long as those requests are initiated via a pen registered to the
									printer.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d522d5">3.3 Netpage Pen Security</p>
								<p xml:id="_9df129" n="0363">Each netpage pen is assigned a unique identifier at time of manufacture which is stored in read-only memory in the pen and in the netpage registration server database.
									The pen ID 61 uniquely identifies the pen on the netpage network.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_8618a7" n="0364">A netpage pen can &quot;know&quot; a number of netpage printers, and a printer can &quot;know&quot; a number of pens. A pen communicates with a printer via a radio
									frequency signal whenever it is within range of the printer. Once a pen and printer are registered, they regularly exchange session keys. Whenever the pen transmits digital ink to the
									printer, the digital ink is always encrypted using the appropriate session key. Digital ink is never transmitted in the clear.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_437f13" n="0365">A pen stores a session key for every printer it knows, indexed by printer ID, and a printer stores a session key for every pen it knows, indexed by pen ID. Both have a
									large but finite storage capacity for session keys, and will forget a session key on a least-recently-used basis if necessary.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_6ab0ca" n="0366">When a pen comes within range of a printer, the pen and printer discover whether they know each other. If they don't know each other, then the printer determines
									whether it is supposed to know the pen. This might be, for example, because the pen belongs to a user who is registered to use the printer. If the printer is meant to know the pen but
									doesn't, then it initiates the automatic pen registration procedure. If the printer isn't meant to know the pen, then it agrees with the pen to ignore it until the pen is placed in a charging
									cup, at which time it initiates the registration procedure.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ac78cc" n="0367">In addition to its public ID, the pen contains a secret key-exchange key. The key-exchange key is also recorded in the netpage registration server database at time of
									manufacture. During registration, the pen transmits its pen ID to the printer, and the printer transmits the pen ID to the netpage registration server. The server generates a session key for
									the printer and pen to use, and securely transmits the session key to the printer. It also transmits a copy of the session key encrypted with the pen's key-exchange key. The printer stores
									the session key internally, indexed by the pen ID, and transmits the encrypted session key to the pen. The pen stores the session key internally, indexed by the printer ID.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fbb1a9" n="0368">Although a fake pen can impersonate a pen in the pen registration protocol, only a real pen can decrypt the session key transmitted by the printer.</p>
								<p xml:id="_00c8c3" n="0369">When a previously unregistered pen is first registered, it is of limited use until it is linked to a user. A registered but &quot;un-owned&quot; pen is only allowed to
									be used to request and fill in netpage user and pen registration forms, to register a new user to which the new pen is automatically linked, or to add a new pen to an existing user.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aded2d" n="0370">The pen uses secret-key rather than public-key encryption because of hardware performance constraints in the pen.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b3884a">3.4 Secure Documents</p>
								<p xml:id="_309d1f" n="0371">The netpage system supports the delivery of secure documents such as tickets and coupons. The netpage printer includes a facility to print watermarks, but will only do
									so on request from publishers who are suitably authorized. The publisher indicates its authority to print watermarks in its certificate, which the printer is able to authenticate.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_42a976" n="0372">The &quot;watermark&quot; printing process uses an alternative dither matrix in specified &quot;watermark&quot; regions of the page. Back-to-back pages contain
									mirror-image watermark regions which coincide when printed. The dither matrices used in odd and even pages' watermark regions are designed to produce an interference effect when the regions
									are viewed together, achieved by looking through the printed sheet.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3f77b5" n="0373">The effect is similar to a watermark in that it is not visible when looking at only one side of the page, and is lost when the page is copied by normal means.</p>
								<p xml:id="_751db9" n="0374">Pages of secure documents cannot be copied using the built-in netpage copy mechanism described in Section 1.9 above. This extends to copying netpages on netpage-aware
									photocopiers.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_aacd95" n="0375">Secure documents are typically generated as part of e-commerce transactions. They can therefore include the user's photograph which was captured when the user
									registered biometric information with the netpage registration server, as described in Section 2.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2babaf" n="0376">When presented with a secure netpage document, the recipient can verify its authenticity by requesting its status in the usual way. The unique ID of a secure document
									is only valid for the lifetime of the document, and secure document IDs are allocated non-contiguously to prevent their prediction by opportunistic forgers. A secure document verification pen
									can be developed with built-in feedback on verification failure, to support easy point-of-presentation document verification.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_781be1" n="0377">Clearly neither the watermark nor the user's photograph are secure in a cryptographic sense. They simply provide a significant obstacle to casual forgery. Online
									document verification, particularly using a verification pen, provides an added level of security where it is needed, but is still not entirely immune to forgeries.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3c755">3.5 Non-Repudiation</p>
								<p xml:id="_9a52f7" n="0378">In the netpage system, forms submitted by users are delivered reliably to forms handlers and are persistently archived on netpage page servers. It is therefore
									impossible for recipients to repudiate delivery.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ef4877" n="0379">E-commerce payments made through the system, as described in Section 4, are also impossible for the payee to repudiate.</p>
								<p xml:id="_4547f2">4 Electronic Commerce Model</p>
								<p xml:id="_97497f">4.1 Secure Electronic Transaction (SET)</p>
								<p xml:id="_b57fbd" n="0380">The netpage system uses the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) system as one of its payment systems. SET, having been developed by MasterCard and Visa, is organized
									around payment cards, and this is reflected in the terminology. However, much of the system is independent of the type of accounts being used.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_602f7d" n="0381">In SET, cardholders and merchants register with a certificate authority and are issued with certificates containing their public signature keys. The certificate
									authority verifies a cardholder's registration details with the card issuer as appropriate, and verifies a merchant's registration details with the acquirer as appropriate. Cardholders and
									merchants store their respective private signature keys securely on their computers. During the payment process, these certificates are used to mutually authenticate a merchant and
									cardholder, and to authenticate them both to the payment gateway.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_33f4a2" n="0382">SET has not yet been adopted widely, partly because cardholder maintenance of keys and certificates is considered burdensome. Interim solutions which maintain
									cardholder keys and certificates on a server and give the cardholder access via a password have met with some success.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e63d1b">4.2 Set Payments</p>
								<p xml:id="_d72dd6" n="0383">In the netpage system the netpage registration server acts as a proxy for the netpage user (i.e. the cardholder) in SET payment transactions.</p>
								<p xml:id="_32b39e" n="0384">The netpage system uses biometrics to authenticate the user and authorize SET payments. Because the system is pen-based, the biometric used is the user's on-line
									signature, consisting of time-varying pen position and pressure. A fingerprint biometric can also be used by designing a fingerprint sensor into the pen, although at a higher cost. The type
									of biometric used only affects the capture of the biometric, not the authorization aspects of the system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_da1d61" n="0385">The first step to being able to make SET payments is to register the user's biometric with the netpage registration server. This is done in a controlled environment,
									for example a bank, where the biometric can be captured at the same time as the user's identity is verified. The biometric is captured and stored in the registration database, linked to the
									user's record. The user's photograph is also optionally captured and linked to the record. The SET cardholder registration process is completed, and the resulting private signature key and
									certificate are stored in the database. The user's payment card information is also stored, giving the netpage registration server enough information to act as the user's proxy in any SET
									payment transaction.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a372ac" n="0386">When the user eventually supplies the biometric to complete a payment, for example by signing a netpage order form, the printer securely transmits the order
									information, the pen ID and the biometric data to the netpage registration server. The server verifies the biometric with respect to the user identified by the pen ID, and from then on acts
									as the user's proxy in completing the SET payment transaction.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3e7c95">4.3 Micro-Payments</p>
								<p xml:id="_89891f" n="0387">The netpage system includes a mechanism for micro-payments, to allow the user to be conveniently charged for printing low-cost documents on demand and for copying
									copyright documents, and possibly also to allow the user to be reimbursed for expenses incurred in printing advertising material. The latter depends on the level of subsidy already provided
									to the user.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_35e682" n="0388">When the user registers for e-commerce, a network account is established which aggregates micro-payments. The user receives a statement on a regular basis, and can
									settle any outstanding debit balance using the standard payment mechanism.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3851a2" n="0389">The network account can be extended to aggregate subscription fees for periodicals, which would also otherwise be presented to the user in the form of individual
									statements.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_fc894b">4.4 Transactions</p>
								<p xml:id="_0a2ab3" n="0390">When a user requests a netpage in a particular application context, the application is able to embed a user-specific transaction ID 55 in the page. Subsequent input
									through the page is tagged with the transaction ID, and the application is thereby able to establish an appropriate context for the user's input.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_754f91" n="0391">When input occurs through a page which is not user-specific, however, the application must use the user's unique identity to establish a context. A typical example
									involves adding items from a pre-printed catalog page to the user's virtual &quot;shopping cart&quot;. To protect the user's privacy, however, the unique user ID 60 known to the netpage
									system is not divulged to applications. This is to prevent different application providers from easily correlating independently accumulated behavioral data.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_3c7431" n="0392">The netpage registration server instead maintains an anonymous relationship between a user and an application via a unique alias ID 65, as shown in FIG. 24. Whenever
									the user activates a hyperlink tagged with the &quot;registered&quot; attribute, the netpage page server asks the netpage registration server to translate the associated application ID 64,
									together with the pen ID 61, into an alias ID 65. The alias ID is then submitted to the hyperlink's application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b9a1cf" n="0393">The application maintains state information indexed by alias ID, and is able to retrieve user-specific state information without knowledge of the global identity of the
									user.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d64184" n="0394">The system also maintains an independent certificate and private signature key for each of a user's applications, to allow it to sign application transactions on behalf
									of the user using only application-specific information.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9e8896" n="0395">To assist the system in routing product bar code (UPC) &quot;hyperlink&quot; activations, the system records a favorite application on behalf of the user for any number
									of product types.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d20d81" n="0396">Each application is associated with an application provider, and the system maintains an account on behalf of each application provider, to allow it to credit and debit
									the provider for click-through fees etc.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b06aae" n="0397">An application provider can be a publisher of periodical subscribed content. The system records the user's willingness to receive the subscribed publication, as well as
									the expected frequency of publication.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_711aaa">4.5 Resource Descriptions and Copyright</p>
								<p xml:id="_45c8bd" n="0398">A preferred embodiment of a resource description class diagram is shown in FIG. 40.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a1e3fa" n="0399">Each document and content object may be described by one or more resource descriptions 842. Resource descriptions use the Dublin Core metadata element set, which is
									designed to facilitate discovery of electronic resources. Dublin Core metadata conforms to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Resource Description Framework (RDF).
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c6cdbc" n="0400">A resource description may identify rights holders 920. The netpage system automatically transfers copyright fees from users to rights holders when users print
									copyright content.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e3918c">5 Communications Protocols</p>
								<p xml:id="_6a966a" n="0401">A communications protocol defines an ordered exchange of messages between entities. In the netpage system, entities such as pens, printers and servers utilise a set of
									defined protocols to cooperatively handle user interaction with the netpage system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e89ea9" n="0402">Each protocol is illustrated by way of a sequence diagram in which the horizontal dimension is used to represent message flow and the vertical dimension is used to
									represent time. Each entity is represented by a rectangle containing the name of the entity and a vertical column representing the lifeline of the entity. During the time an entity exists,
									the lifeline is shown as a dashed line. During the time an entity is active, the lifeline is shown as a double line. Because the protocols considered here do not create or destroy entities,
									lifelines are generally cut short as soon as an entity ceases to participate in a protocol.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_45a9cf">5.1 Subscription Delivery Protocol</p>
								<p xml:id="_352772" n="0403">A preferred embodiment of a subscription delivery protocol is shown in FIG. 43.</p>
								<p xml:id="_b5852d" n="0404">A large number of users may subscribe to a periodical publication. Each user's edition may be laid out differently, but many users' editions will share common content
									such as text objects and image objects. The subscription delivery protocol therefore delivers document structures to individual printers via pointcast, but delivers shared content objects via
									multicast.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4fdfb2" n="0405">The application (i.e. publisher) first obtains a document ID 51 for each document from an ID server 12. It then sends each document structure, including its document ID
									and page descriptions, to the page server 10 responsible for the document's newly allocated ID. It includes its own application ID 64, the subscriber's alias ID 65, and the relevant set of
									multicast channel names. It signs the message using its private signature key.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_60b1eb" n="0406">The page server uses the application ID and alias ID to obtain from the registration server the corresponding user ID 60, the user's selected printer ID 62 (which may
									be explicitly selected for the application, or may be the user's default printer), and the application's certificate.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_55776f" n="0407">The application's certificate allows the page server to verify the message signature. The page server's request to the registration server fails if the application ID
									and alias ID don't together identify a subscription 808.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_cec10c" n="0408">The page server then allocates document and page instance IDs and forwards the page descriptions, including page IDs 50, to the printer. It includes the relevant set of
									multicast channel names for the printer to listen to.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_9e932c" n="0409">It then returns the newly allocated page IDs to the application for future reference.</p>
								<p xml:id="_fa14e6" n="0410">Once the application has distributed all of the document structures to the subscribers' selected printers via the relevant page servers, it multicasts the various
									subsets of the shared objects on the previously selected multicast channels. Both page servers and printers monitor the appropriate multicast channels and receive their required content
									objects. They are then able to populate the previously pointcast document structures. This allows the page servers to add complete documents to their databases, and it allows the printers to
									print the documents.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_7fe3c7">5.2 Hyperlink Activation Protocol</p>
								<p xml:id="_8c56b5" n="0411">A preferred embodiment of a hyperlink activation protocol is shown in FIG. 45.</p>
								<p xml:id="_2187a4" n="0412">When a user clicks on a netpage with a netpage pen, the pen communicates the click to the nearest netpage printer 601. The click identifies the page and a location on
									the page. The printer already knows the ID 61 of the pen from the pen connection protocol.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a851c3" n="0413">The printer determines, via the DNS, the network address of the page server 10a handling the particular page ID 50. The address may already be in its cache if the user
									has recently interacted with the same page. The printer then forwards the pen ID, its own printer ID 62, the page ID and click location to the page server.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_dca92c" n="0414">The page server loads the page description 5 identified by the page ID and determines which input element's zone 58, if any, the click lies in. Assuming the relevant
									input element is a hyperlink element 844, the page server then obtains the associated application ID 64 and link ID 54, and determines, via the DNS, the network address of the application
									server hosting the application 71.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0a83be" n="0415">The page server uses the pen ID 61 to obtain the corresponding user ID 60 from the registration server 11, and then allocates a globally unique hyperlink request ID 52
									and builds a hyperlink request 934. The hyperlink request class diagram is shown in FIG. 44. The hyperlink request records the IDs of the requesting user and printer, and identifies the
									clicked hyperlink instance 862. The page server then sends its own server ID 53, the hyperlink request ID, and the link ID to the application.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d09947" n="0416">The application produces a response document according to application-specific logic, and obtains a document ID 51 from an ID server 12. It then sends the document to

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f2b3ee" n="0417">The second page server sends the hyperlink request ID and application ID to the first page server to obtain the corresponding user ID and printer ID 62. The first page

								<p xml:id="_28bd16">5.3 Handwriting Recognition Protocol</p>
								<p xml:id="_27da34" n="0421">When a user draws a stroke on a netpage with a netpage pen, the pen communicates the stroke to the nearest netpage printer. The stroke identifies the page and a path on
									the page.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_d0a3d7" n="0422">The printer forwards the pen ID 61, its own printer ID 62, the page ID 50 and stroke path to the page server 10 in the usual way.</p>
								<p xml:id="_f8a6da" n="0423">The page server loads the page description 5 identified by the page ID and determines which input element's zone 58, if any, the stroke intersects. Assuming the
									relevant input element is a text field 878, the page server appends the stroke to the text field's digital ink.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_854bb3" n="0424">After a period of inactivity in the zone of the text field, the page server sends the pen ID and the pending strokes to the registration server 11 for interpretation.
									The registration server identifies the user corresponding to the pen, and uses the user's accumulated handwriting model 822 to interpret the strokes as handwritten text. Once it has converted
									the strokes to text, the registration server returns the text to the requesting page server. The page server appends the text to the text value of the text field.

								<p xml:id="_c97bf3">5.4 Signature Verification Protocol</p>
								<p xml:id="_793188" n="0425">Assuming the input element whose zone the stroke intersects is a signature field 880, the page server 10 appends the stroke to the signature field's digital ink.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a16e02" n="0426">After a period of inactivity in the zone of the signature field, the page server sends the pen ID 61 and the pending strokes to the registration server 11 for
									verification. It also sends the application ID 64 associated with the form of which the signature field is part, as well as the form ID 56 and the current data content of the form. The
									registration server identifies the user corresponding to the pen, and uses the user's dynamic signature biometric 818 to verify the strokes as the user's signature. Once it has verified the
									signature, the registration server uses the application ID 64 and user ID 60 to identify the user's application-specific private signature key. It then uses the key to generate a digital
									signature of the form data, and returns the digital signature to the requesting page server. The page server assigns the digital signature to the signature field and sets the associated
									form's status to frozen.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_367536" n="0427">The digital signature includes the alias ID 65 of the corresponding user. This allows a single form to capture multiple users' signatures.</p>

								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b9553b" n="0458">The provision of the accelerometers enables this embodiment of the pen 101 to sense motion without reference to surface location tags, allowing the location tags to be
									sampled at a lower rate. Each location tag ID can then identify an object of interest rather than a position on the surface. For example, if the object is a user interface input element (e.g.
									a command button), then the tag ID of each location tag within the area of the input element can directly identify the input element.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_ab283c" n="0459">The acceleration measured by the accelerometers in each of the x and y directions is integrated with respect to time to produce an instantaneous velocity and position.

									simultaneously, in full color and with full bleed.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b5acfa" n="0462">An integral binding assembly 605 applies a strip of glue along one edge of each printed sheet, allowing it to adhere to the previous sheet when pressed against it. This
									creates a final bound document 618 which can range in thickness from one sheet to several hundred sheets.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_211a84" n="0463">The replaceable ink cartridge 627, shown in FIG. 13 coupled with the duplexed print engines, has bladders or chambers for storing fixative, adhesive, and cyan, magenta,
									yellow, black and infrared inks. The cartridge also contains a micro air filter in a base molding. The micro air filter interfaces with an air pump 638 inside the printer via a hose 639. This
									provides filtered air to the printheads to prevent ingress of micro particles into the Memjet(TM) printheads 350 which might otherwise clog the printhead nozzles. By incorporating the air
									filter within the cartridge, the operational life of the filter is effectively linked to the life of the cartridge. The ink cartridge is a fully recyclable product with a capacity for
									printing and gluing 3000 pages (1500 sheets).

								<p xml:id="_4beca4">7.2.2 Print Engine Controller</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a910d" n="0483">The page expansion and printing pipeline of the print engine controller 760 consists of a high speed IEEE 1394 serial interface 659, a standard JPEG decoder 763, a
									standard Group 4 Fax decoder 764, a custom halftoner/compositor unit 765, a custom tag encoder 766, a line loader/formatter unit 767, and a custom interface 768 to the Memjet(TM) printhead
									350.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_92194b" n="0484">The print engine controller 360 operates in a double buffered manner. While one page is loaded into DRAM 769 via the high speed serial interface 659, the previously
									loaded page is read from DRAM 769 and passed through the print engine controller pipeline. Once the page has finished printing, the page just loaded is printed while another page is loaded.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_a2a53f" n="0485">The first stage of the pipeline expands (at 763) the JPEG-compressed contone CMYK layer, expands (at 764) the Group 4 Fax-compressed bi-level black layer, and renders
									(at 766) the bi-level netpage tag layer according to the tag format defined in section 1.2, all in parallel. The second stage dithers (at 765) the contone CMYK layer and composites (at 765)
									the bi-level black layer over the resulting bi-level CMYK layer. The resultant bi-level CMYK+IR dot data is buffered and formatted (at 767) for printing on the Memjet(TM) printhead 350 via a
									set of line buffers. Most of these line buffers are stored in the off-chip DRAM. The final stage prints the six channels of bi-level dot data (including fixative) to the Memjet(TM) printhead
									350 via the printhead interface 768.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_147f8e" n="0486">When several print engine controllers 760 are used in unison, such as in a duplexed configuration, they are synchronized via a shared line sync signal 770. Only one
									print engine 760, selected via the external master/slave pin 771, generates the line sync signal 770 onto the shared line.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_65d171" n="0487">The print engine controller 760 contains a low-speed processor 772 for synchronizing the page expansion and rendering pipeline, configuring the printhead 350 via a
									low-speed serial bus 773, and controlling the stepper motors 675, 676.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_06eadc" n="0488">In the 8[1/2]'' versions of the netpage printer, the two print engines each prints 30 Letter pages per minute along the long dimension of the page (11''), giving a line
									rate of 8.8 kHz at 1600 dpi. In the 12'' versions of the netpage printer, the two print engines each prints 45 Letter pages per minute along the short dimension of the page (8[1/2]''), giving
									a line rate of 10.2 kHz. These line rates are well within the operating frequency of the Memjet(TM) printhead, which in the current design exceeds 30 kHz.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_1de07c">8 Netpage Greeting Cards</p>
								<p xml:id="_b5e28e" n="0489">The netpage system provides an application whereby a user can create a customised greeting card by selecting an image and a greeting message, and adding a handwritten
									message. The card can be sent to the recipient either directly to their default netpage printer, or to their postal address.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_29565f" n="0490">A user can select a greeting card from an on-line catalogue, add a handwritten message, and dispatch it via the netpage network. Cards can be addressed to other netpage
									users, and to normal postal addresses. In the latter case the card is printed at the service centre closest to the recipient, automatically placed in an envelope, and mailed through the local
									mail system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bae99f" n="0491">Netpage users can choose to receive cards from anyone, or only from authorised friends.</p>
								<p xml:id="_ee165f">8.1 Application Diagram Notation</p>
								<p xml:id="_6ad290" n="0492">Each application user interface flow is illustrated as a collection of documents linked by command arrows. A command arrow indicates that the target document is printed
									as a result of the user pressing the corresponding command button on the source page. Some command arrows are labelled with multiple commands separated by slashes ('/'s), indicating that any
									one of the specified commands causes the target document to be printed. Although multiple commands may label the same command arrow, they typically have different side-effects.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_bdbea7" n="0493">In application terms, it is important to distinguish between netpage documents and netpage forms. Documents contain printed information, as well as command buttons
									which can be pressed by the user to request further information or some other action. Forms, in addition to behaving like normal documents, also contain input fields which can be filled in by
									the user. They provide the system with a data input mechanism. It is also useful to distinguish between documents which contain generic information and documents which contain information
									specific to a particular interaction between the user and an application. Generic documents may be pre-printed publications such as magazines sold at news stands or advertising posters
									encountered in public places. Forms may also be pre-printed, including, for example, subscription forms encountered in pre-printed publications. They may, of course, also be generated
									on-the-fly by a netpage printer in response to user requests. User-specific documents and forms are normally generated on the fly by a netpage printer in response to user requests. FIG. 48
									shows a generic document 990, a generic form 991, a user-specific document 992, and a user-specific form 993.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_e403d1" n="0494">Netpages which participate in a user interface flow are further described by abstract page layouts. A page layout may contain various kinds of elements, each of which
									has a unique style to differentiate it from the others. As shown in FIG. 49, these include fixed information 994, variable information 995, input fields 996, command buttons 997, and
									draggable commands 998.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_f986c3" n="0495">When a user interface flow is broken up into multiple diagrams, any document which is duplicated is shown with dashed outlines in all but the main diagram which defines
									it.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2ea954">8.2 Greeting Cards Object Model</p>
								<p xml:id="_7a790c" n="0496">The greeting cards object model revolves around a greeting card supplier, customers and customised greeting cards. The Greeting Cards class diagram 500 is shown in FIG.
									50.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_47a122" n="0497">Each supplier 501 has a unique identifier and a name 501a. Each customer 502 is related to a particular supplier, and has an identifier 503 which is unique within the
									scope of the particular supplier.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_39f47a" n="0498">Each customer 502 represents a particular netpage user 800 to the supplier. A netpage user, on the other hand, can be the customer of any number of suppliers.</p>
								<p xml:id="_10aaf6" n="0499">The name and description of a customer 502 derive by default from the details of the corresponding netpage user 800.</p>
								<p xml:id="_abf375" n="0500">Each supplier 501 has a number of categories 505 of greeting cards. Each category has a number of card images 525 and a number of card messages 507.</p>
								<p xml:id="_110df7" n="0501">A customer 502 can create a customised card 508. Each customised card has a unique identifier 509, the date and time the card was created, the custom message
									handwritten by the user (stored as digital ink), and a fee. Each customised card has a recipient 510. If the recipient is another netpage user, the card is delivered directly to their default
									netpage printer. If the recipient is not a netpage user, the customer specifies the name and postal address for delivery of the card. The Card Recipient class diagram 511 is shown in FIG. 52.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_5964bc" n="0502">Each customer 502 has an account 512 with the supplier 501, with a running balance 513. Account payments 547 are associated directly with the customer account. The
									payments class diagram 514 is shown in FIG. 51. Each customer has a history of payment methods 515 with the supplier. The set of payment methods 516 to 519 supported by a particular supplier
									will be specific to that supplier, and may be different for different customers depending on their credit ratings etc.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_b3353c" n="0503">When the netpage account payment method 516 is used, the user's netpage account 820 is debited, and the transaction appears on the user's netpage account statement.</p>
								<p xml:id="_74259f" n="0504">When the customer account payment method 517 is used, the user is invoiced for payment.</p>
								<p xml:id="_c3216e" n="0505">When the SET payment method 519 is used, the corresponding SET payment card 821 linked to the user is used to make payment according to the normal SET protocol.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a9c087" n="0506">When the payment card payment method 518 is used, the specified payment card is used to make payment according to the normal protocol between the provider and their
									acquiring bank or institution which handles the particular payment card type.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_0e0291" n="0507">Each payment has a unique payment number, the date and time of the payment, the amount paid, and a receipt number.</p>
								<p xml:id="_9dfc53" n="0508">Netpage users may receive cards from anyone, or only from authorized friends, depending on their netpage e-mail settings. If the user's e-mail privacy setting is such
									that e-mails may only be received from members of their contact list, then greeting cards may also only be received from members of the same contact list.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_4b1bb7">8.3 Greeting Cards User Interface</p>
								<p xml:id="_4d1694" n="0509">The user may obtain the Netpage Greeting Cards main page 522 from a variety of links including:</p>
								<p xml:id="_131877" n="0510">the netpage directory</p>
								<p xml:id="_08eeea" n="0511">the netpage user's own bookmark</p>
								<p xml:id="_2bc02f" n="0512">an advertisement</p>
								<p xml:id="_fe9e16" n="0513">The Netpage Greeting Card user interface flow is shown in FIG. 53, where it can be seen that the user is also able to access card images 525, account 512 details and
									register with the supplier at 523.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_52d93c">8.3.1 Registering</p>
								<p xml:id="_142509" n="0514">The user can register with the greeting card supplier by clicking on the &lt;Register&gt; button 524 on the Greeting Card main page 522, shown in FIG. 56. A User
									Registration form (not shown) is printed. When a user registers, an account is created for the user and the user is then permitted to create and send customized greeting cards.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_eaf912">8.3.2 Creating a Customised Greeting Card</p>
								<p xml:id="_636759" n="0515">The Greeting Card main page 522, shown in FIG. 56, shows the greeting card categories 505. The user clicks on the desired category. If the user is registered with the
									greeting card supplier the Card Image List 525 is printed, as shown in FIG. 57. If the user is not already registered with the supplier a User Registration form is printed.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_524d6a" n="0516">The Card Image list shows thumbnails 526 of the available images for the front page of the customized greeting card. Only two double-sided pages are printed at a time.
									Each time the user clicks &lt;More&gt; 527 another two double-sided pages of thumbnail images are printed. The user selects an image by clicking on it. The Greeting Card Messages page 528 is
									printed as shown in FIG. 58.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2cae9d" n="0517">The Greeting Card Messages page 528 shows the stock messages available for inclusion on the inside page of the customized greeting card. Only two double-sided pages are
									printed at a time. Each time the user clicks &lt;More&gt; 529 another two double-sided pages of card messages are printed. The user selects a message by clicking on it. The Personal Message
									page 530 is printed as shown in FIG. 59.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2deaf4" n="0518">The Personal Message page allows the user to enter a handwritten message 531 on the inside page of the card, along with the stock card message 532. The user can click
									&lt;Preview Card&gt; 533 to print a sample of the card 534 as it will appear to the recipient, as shown in FIGS. 63 and 64. The user clicks &lt;Continue&gt; 535 and the Recipient Address form
									536 is printed, as shown in FIG. 11.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_43e762" n="0519">The Recipient Address form 536 shows the image 525 and messages 531, 532 for the customized greeting card.</p>
								<p xml:id="_11d856" n="0520">If the recipient 510 is a netpage user, the user enters one or more of the recipient's first name, initials, nickname, and family name. If the recipient is not a
									netpage user then the user enters the recipient's name and postal address in the fields provided. The name and address are printed on an envelope as is (i.e. &quot;handwritten&quot;). The
									user clicks &lt;Continue&gt; 537.</p>
								<p xml:id="_dd557f" n="0521">If the recipient is a netpage user the system first looks for matches in the user's contact list. If a single match is found in the user's contact list then the Pay and
									Send form 541 is printed, with the recipient details shown.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_c74f5a" n="0522">If there are no matches with the user's contact list then the global user directory is searched, and the results printed on one or more User Directory Matches pages.
									The user selects the desired recipient by pressing the &lt;Select&gt; button next to the required user name.</p>
								<p xml:id="_a5aafe" n="0523">If there is more than one match with the user's contact list then the Contact List page 538 is printed, as shown in FIG. 61. The user selects the desired recipient 510
									by pressing the &lt;Select&gt; button 539 next to the required user name. If the desired recipient does not appear in the contact list the user presses the &lt;User Directory&gt; button 540
									to automatically search the global user directory for matches. The matching entries are printed on one or more User Directory Matches (not shown) pages. The user selects the desired recipient
									by pressing the &lt;Select&gt; button next to the required user name.</p>
								<p xml:id="_eadf6b" n="0524">Once a single netpage user has been selected as the recipient a Pay and Send form 541 is printed, as shown in FIG. 62.</p>
								<p xml:id="_d6400e" n="0525">The Pay and Send form 541 shows all details of the customized greeting card 508 and shows the fee 542 for delivery of the card. The user signs the form and clicks
									&lt;Send Card&gt; 543. The fee is added to the user's customer account balance 513, and the card is sent to the recipient.</p>
								<p xml:id="_e59702" n="0526">If the recipient is a netpage user the card is printed directly to their default netpage printer. If the recipient is not a netpage user then the country and city are
									extracted from the recipient address. The envelope and card are printed at the country and city specific service center and mailed through the local mail system.
								</p>
								<p xml:id="_2f6d16" n="0527">The Compose Greeting Card function is a multi-page transaction. To assist the user in keeping track of the pages relevant to a single greeting card, the transaction
									number and the current date and time are printed at the top of each page. The user can click a &lt;Reset Form&gt; button at the bottom of any page to void the current form and print a fresh

In a modification (Fig. 3) four burners 8 are used and in another modification (Figs. 4 and 5) the duct 7 is initially horizontal, terminating in a vortex producing manifold (7B) which gives a helical swirling motion to the oxidizing gas. The apparatus is shown, Fig. 6, incorporated in a suspension preheater of the multiple cyclone type associated with a rotary furnace 16 and a clinker cooler 21. The suspension preheater includes cyclones 24, 26 and 28, a material supply hopper 33 with a rotary feed valve 35, an exhaust fan 30, and a dust separator 31. Hot air from the cooler enters the duct 7 and waste gases from the furnace pass to one or all of line 43 feeding the fluidizing pipes 10, line 42 opening into riser pipe 25 or line 41 passing to cooling tower 44 and then to the intake of fan 30. Preheated raw material from hopper 26 passes to a valve casing 39 sharing it between the supply pipes 12 and calcined material from the shaft 1 passes from cyclone 24 to the rotary furnace 16. Alternatively, the one-stringed cyclone preheater may be double-stringed or even four stringed as in Specification 1,319,009.</p>

                        <p xml:lang="en">following statement: -</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">This invention relates to at least the partial calcination of a preheated pulverous raw material, consisting of or containing lime, for example cement raw meal, by the supply of heat before the material is subjected to any finishing calcination and/or any other final heat treatment Calcination in this context is to be understood as expulsion of carbon dioxide from calcium carbonate (Ca OI Ca O+CO 2), which is an endothermic process When the raw material is cement raw meal the aforesaid heat treatment following the calcination is a sintering by which cement clinker is produced The sintering is an exothermic process.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The heat necessary for carrying through the conversion of cement raw meal to cement clinker is usually obtained by burning fuel introduced together with combustion air into a combustion chamber in which the fuel burns successively with the combustion air and forms exit gas As a result, the energy of the fuel is released for heating the exit gas to a high temperature.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The hot exit gas is then brought into contact with the raw meal to be heat treated, i.e preheated, calcined and burned The heat treatment usually takes place as a continuous process in a rotary kiln with slightly inclining axis If so, the lower lying end of the rotary kiln is as is usual for rotary kilns designed as a combustion chamber.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">However, in the manufacture of cement the trend is to carry through preheating and calcination of the raw meal separately by means of hot gas from one source of heat and sintering of the raw meal in a rotary kiln by means of hot gas from another source of heat, that is the flame of the rotary kiln.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">As far as the calcination is concerned relatively large quantities of materials have to be subjected to a relatively low heating, that is, the process takes place at a rather low temperature which is often inconsistent with the use of exit gases of a high temperature for carrying through the calcination.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">There is a great risk of excessively heating the raw meal locally and temporarily and even a brief period of excessively heating a part of the raw meal may cause expulsion of alkali vapours or produce melts which may involve caking problems Furthermore, excessive heating of the raw meal at the calcination stage may prevent chemical reactions intended for a later stage of the whole process of manufacturing cement clinker For example, the formation of clinker minerals at such stage of the whole heat treatment process at which calcination is to take place involves an unfavourable development of the whole process.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">It is the object of the invention to devise a process and a plant for carrying out the process which reduces the drawbacks previously referred to.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">In the process according to the invention an accumulation of preheated pulverous raw material, which consists of or contains lime, is fluidised by means of an incombustible gas which is caused to traverse the accumulation from below at such velocity that it partly causes the surface of the accumulation of raw material, intensely mixed with gas, to overflow a weir, and partly continuously entrains particles of raw material from the accumulation carrying them in suspension to an overlying space and there is maintained in the space at least one flame by the burning of fuel with oxygen-containing gas, such as combustion air, which is supplied to the flame and which entrains the mixture of gas/raw material over-flowing the weir, the arrange1,434,371 ment being such that the necessary amount of heat for calcining at least partially the particles of raw material suspended in the incombustible gas and oxygen-containing gas is transmitted from the flame or flames to the suspension of raw material particles, the particles thus treated being subsequently carried away suspended in a conveying gas mixture composed of combustion gas from the flame or flames, of carbon dioxide expelled from the particles of raw material by the calcination and of the incombustible fluidisation gas, for separation from the conveying gas mixture.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The essential feature of the process is thus that the flame supplying the heat for carrying out the calcination is formed at the place where the raw materials are present, suspended in a gas, and where a fluidised accumulation of preheated raw material placed near the flame serves as source for the suspension of raw material particles in gas.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">When carried out in this way, the process ensures that the flame immediately comes into contact with a cloud of relatively cool particles of raw material in whirling suspension in a gas, by which the flame temperature is lowered so much that an efficient calcination is obtained at a desired low temperature, and approximately isothermally In many cases the flame dwindles to almost nothing The cloud of gas whirling preferably about horizontal axes with suspended particles of raw material protect the walls bounding the flame space against excessive heat from the flame or flames.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The use of the term &quot;partial calcination&quot; in the present context is due to the fact that the whole process of cement burning is often carried through in such a manner that only a partial calcination takes place at the calcination stage, whereas the finishing calcination is effected at the sintering stage Cases may also be assumed in which the preheated raw meal fed to the calcination stage has already been subjected to a certain calcination in the preheater.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The fuel for the calcination may be a gas, an oil or a solid, pulverous fuel, for example coal powder, but anyway it is a gas that is burning, in the two last-mentioned cases, in the form of oil vapour and coal gas respectively.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">A part of the fuel which by its combustion supplies heat for carrying out the calcination of the preheated material, may, instead of directly nourishing the flame or flames, be fed to and mixed with the fluidised accumulation of preheated pulverous raw material, and thus caused in a gaseous state together with the material to enter the space above the fluidised accumulation, 65 where it is subsequently burnt.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">In this context it should be observed that in contrast it is known from our British Patent Application No 57071/72 (Serial No 1,428,680) to mix hie whole of the fuel 70 with the fluidised accumulation of preheated pulverous raw material.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">In certain cases the process may advantageously be modified in that a part of the preheated pulverous material instead of 75 being fed to the accumulation is suspended in the oxygen-containing gas and passed together with the oxygen-containing gas into the space where the fuel is burnt.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">In cases where the raw materials, having 80 been at least partially calcined, are subjected to a finishing calcination and/or other heat treatment, the incombustible gas which is used for fluidising the accumulation of raw material may be constituted by 85 a part of the waste gases from the finishing calcination and/or other heat treatment.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">This supplementary heat treatment of the raw material is often succeeded by a cooling of the final product by causing a mov 90 ing layer thereof to be swept and/or traversed by cooling air in a cooler of known type, such as a grate cooler, a separate planetary cooler, or an underlying rotating drum cooler The oxygen-containing gas is 95 preferably preheated to a temperature below the calcination temperature of the raw material and at least part of the used cooling air from the aforementioned cooling process may thus be used again in the oxy 100 gen-containing gas which is supplied to the flame or flames The economy of the process is thus improved.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Preferably, the weir surrounds an upward flow of the oxygen containing gas, which 105 may then exer-cise a helical swirling action.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The invention also includes calcination apparatus for carrying out the new method, the plant comprising an upright shaft which provides a calcination chamber and the 110 upper end of which is connected to a particle/gas separator and forms an exit for calcined raw material suspended in gas, a supply duct for oxygen-containing gas opening substantially centrally into the bot 115 tom of the calcination chamber, one or more burner pipes extending from below up through the supply duct and opening substantially level with the mouth of the supply duct, means for feeding fuel through 120 the burner pipe or pipes for producing a flame in the calcination chamber at the mouth of each burner pipe, a support formed adjacent to the bottom of the calcination chamber for supporting a fluidised 125 accumulation of pulverous, preheated raw material to a level determined by a weir which separates the interior of the support from the flow of oxygen-containing gas 1,434,371 from the supply pipe, means for feeding incombustible gas into the support from below to maintain the fluidised accumulation of material in the support and means for continuously feeding preheated, pulverous raw material to the support.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Preferably, the calcination chamber is of circular cross-section and the fluidised bed support takes the form of an annular groove formed in the bottom of the chamber and surrounding the mouth of the feeding duct for oxygen-containing gas, the mouth constituting the weir In that case the supply duct may be arranged to cause the oxygen-containing gas to exercise a helical swirling action as it passes up through the calcination chamber.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Examples of a cement burning plant incorporating a calcination plant and another example of calcination plant according to the invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 shows, in vertical section, one plant for the calcination of cement raw meal; Figure 2 is a horizontal section taken on the line II-II in Figure 1; Figure 3 is a horizontal section taken on the line III-III in Figure 1 but showing a modified plant; Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 1 but of the other calcination plant; Figure 5 is a section taken on the line V-V in Figure 4; and, Figure 6 is a diagrammatic representation of the complete cement burning plant, incorporating the calcination plant of Figure 1 as an integral part.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The apparatus shown in Figures 1 and 2 has a shaft forming a calcination chamber 1 and provided with a fire-resistant lining.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The shaft is cylindrical and of circular cross-section although other shapes are possible It is restricted at its upper part so as to form a discharge pipe 2 for wholly or partly calcined particles of raw material.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The pipe leads to a particle/gas separator such as a cyclone (not shown in Figures 1 and 2), into which it opens tangentially.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The chamber 1 has an annular bottom wall 3 and with a central upstanding frustoconical wall 4 so as to form a support receptacle 5 which is open above and takes the form of an annular groove, defined by the bottom wall 3, by the wall of the shaft and by the wall 4 The upper edge of the wall 4 forms a weir 6 which at the same time constitutes the mouth of a vertical supply pipe 7 for combustion air introduced into the shaft 1 from below.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">A burner pipe 8 for the supply of gaseous, liquid or solid pulverous fuel (for example coal powder) is introduced into the supply pipe 7 and passed centrally up to open almost on level with the weir 6, where the fuel forms a flame, nourished by the oxygen of combustion air fed through the supply pipe 7 when the plant is operating.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Supply pipes 10 for incombustible gas, for example atmospheric air under pres 70 sure and supplied through a pipe 11, open at the bottom of the receptacle 5 Beneath the shaft the pipe 11 is formed as an annular pipe connected to all the supply pipes 10, which are uniformly distributed 75 around a circle, as shown in Figure 2, or along two or more concrete circles The incombustible gas supplied in finely divided streams fluidises the accumulation of preheated raw meal which is maintained in the 80 receptacle 5 by a continual supply of fresh raw meal through one or more supply pipes 12 In Figures 1 and 2 two such supply pipes are illustrated and the raw meal for each of the two pipes 12 is fed continually 85 each from its separate cyclone of which only part of the bottom 13 is indicated.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Each of the two cyclones constitutes the lowermost cyclone in its separate string of a two-stringed conventional cyclone pre 90 heater (not shown) for preheating cement raw meal.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Though the preheated raw meal forms a fairly well defined surface 14, its aeration is nevertheless so powerful that raw meal 95 almost in a form-like state partly overflows the weir 6, from the receptacle 5, and partly is carried by the fluidisation gas into the space denoted 15 within the chamber 1 above the surface 14 as the air forces its 100 way up through the surface 14 In similar manner the raw meal having overflown the weir 6 is entrained by the combustion air coming from the supply pipe 7 Both the raw meal entrained by the fluidisation gas 105 and that entrained by the combustion air will thus for a time be present in the space 15, suspended in gas However, in the gas eddies will be formed, mainly about horizontal axes, owing to the combustion air 110 ascending from the central supply pipe 7.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">As a result nearly all the raw meal in the form of free-laid particles receives sooner or later sufficient heat from the flame 9 to enable a substantial part of the raw meal 115 to be wholly calcined, and the balance of raw meal to be almost wholly calcined, at a low temperature and essentially isothermally.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The raw meal thus treated is removed 120 from the top of the chamber 1 through the pipe 2, suspended in a gas mixture composed of combustion gas from the flame 9, carbon dioxide developed by calcination of the raw material particles, and fluidisation 125 gas supplied from the pipes 10.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Figure 3 gives an outline of a detail of the calcination apparatus based upon the formation not only of one flame 9 but upon four such flames In that case there is not 130 1,434,371 one central burner pipe 8 but four such ( pipes denoted 8 ', distributed symmetrically i in the supply pipe 7 and receiving the fuel l which is then preferably gas or oil from t an annular pipe 8 &quot; fed from a common I feeding pipe 8 &quot;' The modification illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 differs from the Figure 1 example in that the combustion air supply pipe 7 is fed laterally through a branch 7 A which leads i into a vortex producing manifold 7 B which in turn causes the air to exercise a helical swirling action as it passes up through the space 15 as indicated by the arrowed line.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">In this case eddy currents like those indicated by the curves or arrows in the Figure 1 example will not be formed, but the helical swirling motion of the gas will have the same effect as the eddies, although their common axis of rotation is vertical in this case instead of horizontal.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Figure 6 shows diagrammatically a plant for the manufacture of cement clinker on the basis of cold cement raw meal In the installation the calcination plant shown in Figures 1 and 2 constitutes an integral part, although, by simple adaption the Figures 4 and 5 plant could equally well be incorporated Parts shown in Figure 4 that are common with those of Figures 1 and 2 are therefore provided with the same reference numerals.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Thus, in Figure 6 there is also the chamber 1 with the discharge pipe 2 and the supply pipes 7, 10, 11 and 12.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">In addition there is a rotary kiln 16 in which the preheated and wholly or partially calcined raw meal after finished calcination, if any, is burnt to cement clinker The heat for carrying through these kiln processes is obtained from gaseous, liquid or solid pulverous fuel fed to the interior of the kiln through a burner pipe 17 at the mouth of which there is formed a flame 18.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The hot gases from the burner pipe are passed through the slightly inclining kiln counter-currently to the calcined raw meal sliding down through the kiln in turbulence, swept by the kiln gases, by which burning of the raw meal to form cement clinker takes place.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The exit gases leave the kiln through a chamber 19 surrounding the upper kiln end; and the exit gases proceed through a gas pipe which is indicated in the Figure simply by a stippled line 20.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Similarly the lower kiln end is surrounded by a casing 21, which also surrounds a cooler, in which the clinker leaving the kiln at a temperature of 1110012000 is cooled to about 1000 C by the passage of atmospheric air, which is consequently heated and then utilised as preheated combustion air both in the rotary kiln 16 and in the chamber 1 The cooler consists of a grate 22, on which the clinker s distributed in a layer of suitable thickless The layer of clinker then moves coninuously away from the kiln, penetrated by transverse streams of cooling air supplied 70 under pressure through a cooling air supply pipe 23 to the space below the grate 22 The extreme end of the cooler from which the cooled clinker is discharged is not shown in the Figure Having passed through the 75 layer of clinker, the cooling air now preheated flows along the paths indicated by arrows, partly into the rotary kiln 16, partly through the supply pipe 7, which is connected to the upper end of the casing 80 21, and into the chamber 1 as described in connection with Figure 1.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">With reference to Figure 1 it was further mentioned that the discharge pipe 2 for calcined raw meal suspended in the waste 85 gas from the calcination process was to be introduced tangentially into a cyclone This is shown in Figure 4 and denoted 24 In this cyclone the calcined raw meal is separated from the waste gases and settles on the 90 bottom of the cyclone, whilst the waste gases leave the cyclone through an upper central riser pipe 25.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The riser pipe 25 with a corresponding cyclone 26 and another riser pipe 27 with 95 a corresponding cyclone 28 constitute a conventional two-stage cyclone preheater in which the cold raw meal is preheated by means of the waste gases from the calcination process before it is calcined itself 100 From the top of the uppermost cyclone 28 of the cyclone preheater the waste gases are introduced through a central discharge pipe 29 into a fan 30 which produces the necessary sub-atmospheric pressure to cause 105 the gas flow to take the path determined by the reference numerals 23, 21, 22, 7, 1, 2, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 The delivery side of fan 30 opens into a dust precipitator 31 in which dust contained in the waste 110 gases is removed so that they may escape through a vent pipe 32 into the atmosphere without causing damage.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The cold raw meal to be preheated, calcined and burnt to cement clinker is fed 115 from a hopper 33 and sinks from the hopper into a feed pipe 34 which is fitted with a rotary gate valve 35 which prevents simultaneous intake of atmospheric air into the feed pipe 34 The other end of the pipe 120 34 opens into the lower end of the riser pipe 27 for the uppermost cyclone 28 of the cyclone preheater, which means that there is a sub-atmospheric pressure in the whole cyclone preheater, and also in the pipe 27, 125 since the cyclone preheater is connected with the suction side of the fan 30.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The raw meal fed is suspended in and heated by the hot gases ascending through the riser pipe 27 and is subsequently intro 130 1,434,371 duced into the cyclone 28, in which the preheated raw meal is separated off and sinks to the bottom of the cyclone, leaving the cyclone through a feed pipe 36 into which is inserted a rotary gate valve 37 serving the same purpose as the rotary gate valve 35 The raw meal is then introduced through the lower end of the riser pipe 25 into the lowermost preheater cyclone 26, suspended in the gases ascending through the riser pipe 25 In the cyclone 26 the further preheated raw meal and the gases are again separated, the gases following the path already described, whereas the raw meal sinks to the bottom of the cyclone 26 and hence into a feed pipe 38.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">If the arrangement according to Figure 6 had conformed fully to the plant shown in Figures 1 and 2 which foresees the use not of a single-string, but of a two-string cyclone preheater, there would have been two cyclones 26, one for each string and each having a separate feed pipe 38 The bottoms of the two cyclones and their feed pipes would then have conformed to the parts 13 and 12, respectively, of Figure 1.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Now according to Figure 4 the use of a cyclone preheater with one string only is foreseen In order nevertheless to have two feed pipes 12 passed to the receptacle 5 inside the shaft 1 so as to obtain a uniform distribution of preheated raw meal in the receptacle 5, the feed pipe 38 of the plant shown in Figure 6 has been branched into two pipes, both denoted 12, since they correspond to the pipes referred to as branch pipes in Figure 1 A uniform distribution of preheated raw meal to the two branch pipes 12 is effected by means of an adjustable damper located in a casing 39.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The raw meal calcined in the shaft 1 and separated from the gas in the cyclone 24 and the further passage of which has already been described is passed through a pipe 40 into the rotary kiln 16, in which the raw meal is converted to clinker as already described.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The heated solid particles of material contained in the exit gases of the rotary kiln leaving the kiln along the path indicated by the stippled line 20 may be utilised in various manner depending on the path indicated by the stippled lines 41, 42, and 43 along which the kiln gas may be passed.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Depending on the circumstances only one of the paths, two of them, or all three of them may be used.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">If the kiln gases, or part thereof, flow as indicated by the stippled line 41, they unite with waste gases from the calcination of the raw meal in the shaft 1 directly before they are sucked into the fan 30 by which they are forced into the dust precipitator 31.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Since the precipitator cannot withstand an excessive gas temperature, there is inserted a cooling tower 44 in the circuit as illustrated diagrammatically In the cooling tower the gases are cooled by water As a result the heat contained in the gases is lost unless the heat transmitted to the cooling water 70 can be utilised The solid particles, that is, dust contained in the waste gases, are, however, intercepted together with dust contained in the waste gases from calcination and preheating in the dust precipitator 31 75 and may, unless the dust contains an excessive amount of alkalis or chlorine, be fed to the rotary kiln 16, for example by being introduced into the pipe 40 as indicated by a stippled line 45 80 If the exit gases from the rotary kiln 16 or a part thereof follow the stippled line 42, they unite with the waste gases from the calcination of the raw meal effected in the chamber 1 and are introduced together 85 with the latter gases into the cyclone preheater ( 25, 26, 27, 28, 29) In that case the heat contained in the rotary kiln gases is utilised as a contribution to preheat the raw meal and consequently to improve the 90 economy of the process The gases are cooled correspondingly and may therefore without damage pass with the waste gases from the calcination through the fan 30 into the dust precipitator 31, in which the total 95 amount of dust is intercepted to be utilised if required as described in the foregoing.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">If the exit gases from the rotary kiln 16, or a part thereof, follow the stippled line 43, they are introduced in the pipe 11 in 100 stead of atmospheric air, and they will thus via the feed pipes 10 constitute the air that effects the fluidisation of the preheated raw meal in the receptacle 5 (see Figure 1).</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">As a result of the heat contained in the gas, 105 the raw meal will be further heated while it is traversed by the gas from below Solid particles contained in the gas mix with the other particles which are being suspended in the gas present in the shaft 1 in the space 110 above the receptacle 5 (see Figure 1).</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Reference has been made in the foregoing to alternative conveying paths in connection with Figure 6, indicated by stippled lines 115 Also in Figure 1 certain alternatives are illustrated Thus, the stippled lines 46 indicate that a part of the preheated raw meal from the cyclones 13 instead of being passed with the remaining material to the 120 receptacle 5 is introduced into the feed pipe 7 for combustion air, so as to be suspended therein and passed into the space 15.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Further stippled lines 47 suggest that a part of the fuel, instead of being fed 125 directly to the flame 9 through burner pipe 8, may be branched off from the pipe and introduced into the bottom end of the receptacle 5 similarly as the fluidisation air is fed through the pipes 11 and 10 Unless 130 1,434,371 the fuel is already in a gaseous state, it will be converted to gas or vapours (forming oil vapours or coal gas) when meeting the hot raw meal The gas will ascend together with the fluidisation air through the accumulation of raw meal.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The plant shown in Figure 6 should only be considered an example showing how it may be designed and many modifications may come in for consideration Thus, it has already been suggested that the cyclone preheaters 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 may be onestringed or two-stringed, but it may, for example, also be four-stringed as the preheater protected by our British Patent Application No 56051/71 (Serial No.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">1428680) If so, it will be natural to pass four feed pipes 12, staggered 900 in relation to one another, to the receptacle Instead of two-stage preheaters on Q-stage preheaters or four-stage preheaters may be used.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Furthermore a suspension preheater of a type different from that of the cyclone preheater may be used for preheating the raw meal, and also a clinker cooler other than the grate cooler 21, 22 and 23 may be used after the rotary kiln 16, for example an underlying independently rotating cooling drum or an independently rotating planetary cooler.</p>

                        <p>A method of heat treating a preheated, pulverous raw material consisting of or containing lime, such as cement raw meal. Preheated pulverous raw material is accumulated in a lower portion of a calcination chamber and a substantially incombustible gas is introduced into the accumulation at a sufficient velocity to traverse the accumulation to cause surface portions to overflow a weir. An oxygen-containing gas is introduced into a flame chamber overlying the accumulation. At least one flame is maintained within the flame chamber by burning a fuel therein. The heat necessary for at least partially calcining particles of raw materials suspended in the incombustible gas and oxygen-containing gas is transmitted from the flame to the suspension of raw materials. The treated materials may then be subjected to a finishing calcination and/or any other final heat treatment. An improved calcination plant is disclosed for at least partially calcining a pulverous raw material according to the method of the present invention wherein the heat necessary for at least partially calcining the preheated fluidised raw material is supplied by at least one flame which is maintained in a flame chamber through the introduction of at least one burner pipe into the flame chamber of the plant.</p>

                        <p xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">This invention relates to calcination of preheated pulverous, raw material, such as cement raw meal, consisting of or containing lime. The invention relates to an improved method of at least partially calcining such pulverous, raw materials and improved calcination plants for treating such raw materials according to the improved method wherein heat is supplied directly by maintaining a flame in a flame chamber to effect at least a partial calcination before the material is subjected to any finishing calcination and/or other heat treatment, if any.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Calcination of pulverous raw materials such as cement raw meal is to be understood as an expulsion of carbon dioxide from calcium carbonate by an endothermic process (i.e. a process in which heat is absorbed) according to the equation:CaCo3 .fwdarw. Ca0 + CO2</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">when the raw material is cement raw meal, a finishing heat treatment following the calcination is a sintering by which cement clinker is produced. Sintering is an exothermic process characterized by, or formed with, evolution of heat.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The heat necessary for carrying through the conversion of cement raw meal to cement clinker is usually obtained by burning fuel which together with combustion air, is introduced into a combustion chamber in which the fuel burns successively with the combustion air and forms smoke gas. As a result, the energy contained in the fuel is released for heating the smoke gas to a high temperature. The hot smoke gas is then brought into contact with the raw meal to be heat treated, i.e. preheated, calcined and burned. The heat treatment usually takes place as a continuous process in a rotary kiln with slightly inclining axis. If so, the lower lying end of the rotary kiln is -- as is usual for rotary kilns -- designed as a combustion chamber.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">However, in the manufacture of cement the trend is to carry through preheating and calcination of the raw meal separately by means of hot gas from one source of heat and sintering of the raw meal in a rotary kiln by means of hot gas from another source of heat, that is the flame of the rotary kiln. This is particularly due to the presence of alkalies in the raw meal.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">As far as the calcination of cement raw meal is concerned relatively large quantities of materials have to be subjected to a relatively low heating. That is, the process takes place at a rather low temperature which is often inconsistent with the use of smoke gases of a high temperature for carrying through the calcination. There is a great risk of excessively heating the raw meal locally and temporarily. Even a brief period of excessively heating a part of the raw meal may cause expulsion of alkali vapours or produce melts which may involve caking problems. Furthermore, excessive heating of the raw meal at the calcination stage may prevent chemical reactions intended for a later stage of the whole process of manufacturing cement clinker. For example, the formation of clinker minerals at such stage of the whole heat treatment process at which calcination is to take place involves an unfavorable and disadvantageous development of the whole process.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">U.S. Pat. No. 3,203,681 to Rosa, et al. relates to a process wherein heat for carrying through the calcination of preheated cement raw meal derives from hot gases having a temperature higher than the calcination temperature. The gases are produced in a separate chamber and are passed upwardly in a riser column in which the raw material is suspended and entrained by the gases thus produced. British Patent No. 960,863 to Fritzsche relates to a process for the calcination of raw silicate material in a fluidised state and the pre-heating, calcination, and sintering, or melting steps, of the heat treatment are effected as separate successive operations in a cyclone pre-heater, a fluidised layer and a combustion chamber respectively. However neither of these patents disclose or suggest a method of heat treating a pulverous, raw material or a plant for practicing the method such as I have invented as will develop in the following description. According to my invention, a raw material consisting entirely of, or at least containing a portion of, lime is at least partially calcined substantially isothermically (i.e. constant temperature conditions) at relatively low temperatures by supplying the heat for carrying out the calcination or partial calcination at the place where the raw materials are present, suspended in a gas, and maintained in a fluidised accumulation.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">According to the method of the present invention a preheated, pulverous raw material consisting of, or at least containing a portion of, lime is at least partially calcined. The method comprises accumulating a quantity of the preheated pulverous raw material in a lower portion of a calcination chamber and introducing a substantially incombustible gas in a manner to traverse the accumulation of the raw material from below and at sufficient velocity to fluidise the pulverous raw material and mix the gas with portions of the raw material to cause surface portions thereof to overflow a weir. The gas at least partially continuously entrains particles of the raw material from the accumulation and carries them in suspension to a flame chamber defined by a space overlying the accumulation. The method further comprises introducing into the overlying space an oxygen-containing gas entraining the mixture of gas and raw materials overflowing the weir and maintaining at least one flame in the overlying space by burning the fuel with the oxygen-containing gas by supplying the gas to the flame such that the heat necessary for at least partially calcining the particles of raw materials suspended in the incombustible gas and oxygen-containing gas is transmitted from the flame to the suspension of raw material particles. The method further comprises suspending the particles thus treated in a conveying gas mixture to transport them away from the flame chamber. The conveying gas mixture is composed of combustion gases produced by the flame, carbon dioxide expelled from the particles of raw material by the calcination process, and of the incombustible fluidisation gas. The method further comprises separating the particles from the conveying gas mixture.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">An essential feature of the process is thus that the flame supplying the heat for carrying out the calcination is formed at the place where the raw materials are present, suspended in a gas, and a fluidised accumulation of preheated raw material is maintained. The location of the raw materials being placed near the flame comprises a source for the suspension of raw material particles in gas.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">When carried out in this way, the process ensures that the flame immediately comes into contact with a cloud of relatively cool particles of raw material is whirling suspension in a gas, by which the flame temperature is lowered so much that an efficient calcination is obtained at a desired low temperature, and approximately isothermally. In many cases the flame dwindles to almost nothing. The cloud of gas whirling preferably about horizontal axes with suspended particles of raw material protect the walls bounding the flame space against excessive heat from the flame or flames.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The use of the term &quot;partial calcination&quot; in the present context is due to the fact that the whole process of cement burning is often carried through in such a manner that only a partial calcination takes place at the calcination stage, whereas the finishing calcination is effected at the sintering stage. It is, of course, also conceivable that the preheated raw meal which is passed to the calcination stage has, in fact, already been subjected to a certain amount of calcination during the preheating stage.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The fuel for the calcination may be a gas, an oil or a solid, pulverous fuel, such as coal powder. In any event it is a gas is burning. For example, in the two last-mentioned cases, when a fuel is an oil, an oil vapour is burning, and when the fuel is a coal, a coal gas is burning, respectively.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">A part of the fuel which by its combustion supplies heat for carrying out the calcination of the preheated material, may, instead of directly nourishing the flame or flames, be fed to and mixed with the fluidised accumulation of preheated pulverous raw material, and thus caused in a gaseous state together with the material to enter the space above the fluidised accumulation, where it is subsequently burnt. In this context it should be observed that in contrast it is known from my copending U.S. Patent application filed on Dec. 10, 1973 under Ser. No. 423,436 which derives its priority from British Patent Application No. 57071/72 dated Dec. 11, 1972 to mix the whole of the fuel with the fluidised accumulation of the preheated pulverous raw material.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">In certain cases the process may advantageously be modified in that a part of the preheated pulverous material instead of being fed to the accumulation is suspended in the oxygen-containing gas and passed together with the oxygen-containing gas into the space where the fuel is burnt.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">In cases where the raw materials, having been at least partially calcined, are subjected to a finishing calcination and/or other heat treatment, the incombustible gas which is used for fluidising the accumulation of raw material may be constituted by a part of the waste gases from the finishing calcination and/or other heat treatment. This supplementary heat treatment of the raw material is often succeeded by a cooling of the final product by causing a moving layer thereof to be swept and/or traversed by cooling air in a cooler of known type, such as a grate cooler, a separate planetary cooler, or an underlying rotating drum cooler. The oxygen-containing gas is preferably preheated to a temperature below the calcination temperature of the raw material and at least part of the used cooling air from the aforementioned cooling process may thus be used again in the oxygen-containing gas which is supplied to the flame or flames. The economy of the process is thus improved.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Preferably, the weir surrounds an upward flow of the oxygen-containing gas, which may then exercise a helical swirling action.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The invention also includes calcination apparatus for carrying out the new method, the plant comprising an upright shaft which provides a calcination chamber and the upper end of which is connected to a particle/gas separator and forms an exit for calcined raw material suspended in gas. A supply duct for oxygen-containing gas opening substantially centrally into the bottom of the calcination chamber, one or more burner pipes extending from below up through the supply duct and opening substantially level with the mouth of the supply duct, means for feeding fuel through the burner pipe or pipes for producing a flame in the calcination chamber at the mouth of each burner pipe, a support formed adjacent to the bottom of the calcination chamber for supporting a fluidised accumulation of pulverous, preheated raw material to a level determined by a weir separates the interior of the support from the flow of oxygen-containing gas from the supply pipe, means for feeding incombustible gas into the support from below to maintain the fluidised accumulation of material in the support and means for continuously feeding preheated, pulverous raw material to the support.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Preferably, the calcination chamber is of circular cross-section and the fluidised bed support takes the form of an annular groove formed in the bottom of the chamber and surrounding the mouth of the feeding duct for oxygen-containing gas, the mouth constituting the weir. In that case the supply duct may be arranged to cause the oxygen-containing gas to exercise a helical swirling action as it passes up through the calcination chamber.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">In still another preferred embodiment four burne pipes are utilized such that four separate flames may be maintained in the flame chamber.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The invention also pertains to a plant for the production of cement clinker in which a calcination plant according to the invention is utilized in combination with a rotary kiln to produce cement clinker. In addition, the invention relates to cement raw meal which has been at least partially calcined by a method of heat treating such preheated raw materials.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</p>

                        <p xml:lang="en">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The apparatus shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 has a shaft forming a calcination chamber 1 and provided with a fire-resistant lining. The shaft is cylindrical and of circular cross-section although other shapes are possible. It is restricted at its upper part so as to form a discharge pipe 2 for wholly or partly calcined particles of raw material. The pipe leads to a particle/gas separator such as a cyclone (not shown in FIGS. 1 and 2), into which it opens tangentially.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The chamber 1 has an annular bottom wall 3 and with a central upstanding frusto-conical wall 4 so as to form a support receptacle 5 which is open above and takes the form of an annular groove, defined by the bottom wall 3, by the wall of the shaft and by the wall 4. The upper edge of the wall 4 forms a weir 6 which at the same time constitutes the mouth of a vertical supply pipe 7 for combustion air introduced into the shaft 1 from below.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">A burner pipe 8 for the supply of gaseous, liquid or solid pulverous fuel (for example coal powder) is introduced into the supply pipe 7 and passed centrally up to open almost on level with the weir 6, where the fuel forms a flame, nourished by the oxygen of combustion air fed through the supply pipe 7 when the plant is operating.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Supply pipes 10 for incombustible gas, for example atmospheric air under pressure and supplied through a pipe 11, open at the bottom of the receptacle 5. Beneath the shaft the pipe 11 is formed as an annular pipe connected to all the supply pipes 10, which are uniformly distributed around a circle, as shown in FIG. 2, or along two or more concentric circles. The incombustible gas supplied in finely divided streams fluidises the accumulation of preheated raw meal which is maintained in the receptacle 5 by a continual supply of fresh raw meal through one or more supply pipes 12. In FIGS. 1 and 2 two such supply pipes are illustrated and the raw meal for each of the two pipes 12 is fed continually each from its separate cyclone of which only part of the bottom 13 is indicated. Each of the two cyclones constitutes the lowermost cyclone in its separate string of a two-stringed conventional cyclone preheater (not shown) for preheating cement raw meal.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Though the preheated raw meal forms a fairly well defined surface 14, its aeration is nevertheless so powerful that raw meal almost in a foam-like state partly overflows the weir 6, from the receptacle 5, and partly is carried by the fluidisation gas into the space denoted 15 within the chamber 1 above the surface 14 as the air forces its way up through the surface 14. In similar manner the raw meal having overflown the weir 6 is entrained by the combustion air coming from the supply pipe 7. Both the raw meal entrained by the fluidisation gas and that entrained by the combustion air will thus for a time be present in the space 15, suspended in gas. However, in the gas eddies will be formed, mainly about horizontal axes, owing to the combustion air ascending from the central supply pipe 7. As a result nearly all the raw meal in the form of free-laid particles receives sooner or later sufficient heat from the flame 9 to enable a substantial part of the raw meal to be wholly calcined, and the balance of raw meal to be almost wholly calcined, at a low temperature and essentially isothermally.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The raw meal thus treated is removed from the top of the chamber 1 through the pipe 2, suspended in a gas mixture composed of combustion gas from the flame 9, carbon dioxide developed by calcination of the raw material particles, and fluidisation gas supplied from the pipes 10.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">FIG. 3 illustrates an outline of a detail of the calcination apparatus based upon the formation not only of one flame 9 but upon four such flames. In that case there is not one central burner pipe 8 but four such pipes denoted 8', distributed symmetrically in the supply pipe 7 and receiving the fuel which is then preferably gas or oil from an annular pipe 8&quot; fed from a common feeding pipe 8'&quot;.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The modification illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5 differs from the FIG. 1 example in that the combustion air supply pipe 7 is fed laterally through a branch 7A which leads into a vortex producing manifold 7B which in turn causes the air to exercise a helical swirling action as it passes up through the space 15 as indicated by the arrowed line.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">In this case eddy currents like those indicated by the curves or arrows in the FIG. 1 example will not be formed, but the helical swirling motion of the gas will have the same effect as the eddies, although their common axis of rotation is vertical in this case instead of horizontal.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">FIG. 6 shows diagrammatically a plant for the manufacture of cement clinker on the basis of cold cement raw meal. In the installation the calcination plant shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 constitutes an integral part, although, by simple adaption the FIGS. 4 and 5 plant could equally well be incorporated. Parts shown in FIG. 4 that are common with those of FIGS. 1 and 2 are therefore provided with the same reference numerals. Thus, in FIG. 6 there is also the chamber 1 with the discharge pipe 2 and the supply pipes 7, 10, 11 and 12.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">In addition there is a rotary kiln 16 in which the preheated and wholly or partially calcined raw meal after finished calcination, if any, is burnt to cement clinker. The heat for carrying through these kiln processes is obtained from gaseous, liquid or solid pulverous fuel fed to the interior of the kiln through a burner pipe 17 at the mouth of which there is formed a flame 18. The hot gases from the burner pipe 17 are passed through the slightly inclining kiln counter-currently to the calcined raw meal sliding down through the kiln in turbulence, swept by the kiln gases, by which burning of the raw meal to form cement clinker takes place. The smoke gases leave the kiln through a smoke chamber 19 surrounding the upper kiln end; and the smoke gases proceed through a smoke gas pipe 20.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Similarly the lower kiln end is surrounded by a casing 21, which also surrounds a cooler, in which the clinker leaving the kiln at a temperature of 1100 DEG - 1200 DEGC is cooled to about 100 DEGC by the passage of atmospheric air, which is consequently heated and then utilized as preheated combustion air both in the rotary kiln 16 and in the chamber 1. The cooler consists of a grate 22, on which the clinker is distributed in a layer of suitable thickness. The layer of clinker then moves continuously away from the kiln, penetrated by transverse streams of cooling air supplied under pressure through a cooling air supply pipe 23 to the space below the grate 22. The extreme end of the cooler from which the cooled clinker is discharged is not shown in the Figure. Having passed through the layer of clinker, the cooling air now preheated flows a-ong the paths indicated by arrows, partly into the rotary kiln 16, partly through the supply pipe 7, which is connected to the upper end of the casing 21, and into the chamber 1 as described in connection with FIG. 1.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">With reference to FIG. 1 it was further mentioned that the discharge pipe 2 for calcined raw meal suspended in the waste gas from the calcination process was to be introduced tangentially into a cyclone. This is shown in FIG. 6 in which this cyclone is denoted 24. In this cyclone the calcined raw meal is separated from the waste gases and settles on the bottom of the cyclone, whilst the waste gases leave the cyclone through an upper central riser pipe 25.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The riser pipe 25 with a corresponding cyclone 26 and another riser pipe 27 with a corresponding cyclone 28 constitute a conventional two-stage cyclone preheater in which the cold raw meal is preheated by means of the waste gases from the calcination process before it is calcined itself.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">From the top of the uppermost cyclone 28 of the cyclone preheater the waste gases are introduced through a central discharge pipe 29 into a fan 30 which produces the necessary sub-atmospheric pressure to cause the gas flow to take the path determined by the reference numerals 23, 21, 33, 7, 1 2, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30. The delivery side of fan 30 opens into a dust precipitator 31 in which dust contained in the waste gases is removed so that they may escape through a vent pipe 32 into the atmospheric without causing damage.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The cold raw meal to be preheated, calcined and burnt to cement clinker is fed from a hopper 33 and sinks from the hopper into a feed pipe 34 which is fitted with a rotary gate valve 35 which prevents simultaneous intake of atmospheric air into the feed pipe 34. The other end of the pipe 34 opens into the lower end of the riser pipe 27 for the uppermost cyclone 28 of the cyclone preheater, which means that there is a sub-atmospheric pressure in the whole cyclone preheater, and also in the pipe 27, since the cyclone preheater is connected with the suction of the fan 30.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The raw meal fed is suspended in and heated by the hot gases ascending through the riser pipe 27 and is subsequently introduced into the cyclone 28, in which the preheated raw meal is separated off the sinks to the bottom of the cyclone, leaving the cyclone through a feed pipe 36 into which is inserted a rotary gate valve 37 serving the same purpose as the rotary gate valve 35. The raw meal is then introduced through the lower end of the riser pipe 25 into the lowermost preheater cyclone 26, suspended in the gases ascending through the riser pipe 25. In the cyclone 26 the further preheated raw meal and the gases are again separated, the gases following the path already described, whereas the raw meal sinks to the bottom of the cyclone 26 and hence into a feed pipe 38.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">If the arrangement according to FIG. 6 had conformed fully to the plant shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 which foresees the use not of a single-string, but of a two-string cyclone preheater, there would have been two cyclones 26, one for each string and each having a separate feed pipe 38. The bottoms of the two cyclones and their feed pipes would then have conformed to the parts 13 and 12, respectively, of FIG. 1. Now according to FIG. 4 the use of a cyclone preheater with one string only is foreseen. In order nevertheless to have two feed pipes 12 passed to the receptacle 5 inside the shaft 1 so as to obtain a uniform distribution of preheated raw meal in the receptacle 5, the feed pipe 38 of the plant shown in FIG. 6 has been branched into two pipes, both denoted 12, since they correspond to the pipes referred to as branch pipes in FIG. 1. A uniform distribution of preheated raw meal to the two branch pipes 12 is effected by means of an adjustable damper located in a casing 39.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The raw meal calcined in the shaft 1 and separated from the gas in the cyclone 24 and the further passage of which has already been described is passed through a pipe 40 into the rotary kiln 16, in which the raw meal is converted to clinker as already described.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The heated solid particles of material contained in the exit gases of the rotary kiln leaving the kiln along the path through pipe 20 may be utilized in various manner depending on the path indicated by the dotted lines 41, 42, and 43 along which the kiln gas may be passed. Depending on the circumstances only one of the paths, two of them, or all three of them may be used.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">If the kiln gases, or part thereof, flow as indicated by the dotted line 41, they unite with waste gases from the calcination of the raw meal in the shaft 1 directly before they are sucked into the fan 30 by which they are forced into the dust precipitator 31. Since the precipitator cannot withstand an excessive gas temperature, there is inserted a cooling tower 44 in the circuit as illustrated diagrammatically. In the cooling tower the gases are cooled by water. As a result the heat contained in the gases is lost unless the heat transmitted to the cooling water can be utilized. The solid particles, that is, dust contained in the waste gases, are, however, intercepted together with dust contained in the waste gases from calcination and preheating in the dust precipitator 31 and may, unless the dust contains an excessive amount of alkalis or chlorine, be fed to the rotary kiln 16, for example by being introduced into the pipe 40 as indicated by a dotted line 45.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">If the smoke gases from the rotary kiln 16 or a part thereof follow the dotted line 42, they unite with the waste gases from the calcination of the raw meal effected in the chamber 1 and are introduced together with the latter gases into the cyclone preheater (25, 26, 27, 28, 29). In that case the heat contained in the rotary kiln gases is utilized as a contribution to preheat the raw meal and consequently to improve the economy of the process. The gases are cooled correspondingly and may therefore without damage pass with the waste gases from the calcination through the fan 30 into the dust precipitator 31, in which the total amount of dust is intercepted to be utilized if required as described in the foregoing.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">If the smoke gases from the rotary kiln 16, or a part thereof, follow the dotted line 43, they are introduced in the pipe 11 instead of atmospheric air, and they will thus via the feed pipes 10 constitute the air that effects the fluidisation of the preheated raw meal in the receptacle 5 (see FIG. 1). As a result of the heat contained in the gas, the raw meal will be further heated while it is traversed by the gas from below. Solid particles contained in the gas mix with the other particles which are being suspended in the gas present in the shaft 1 in the space 15 above the receptacle 5 (see FIG. 1).</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Reference has been made in the foregoing to alternative conveying paths in connection with FIG. 6, indicated by the dotted lines.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Also in FIG. 1 certain alternatives are illustrated. Thus, the dotted lines 46 indicate that a part of the preheated raw meal from the cyclones 13 instead of being passed with the remaining material to the receptacle 5 is introduced into the feed pipe 7 for combustion air, so as to be suspended therein and passed into the space 15.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Further dotted lines 47 suggest that a part of the fuel, instead of being fed directly to the flame 9 through burner pipe 8, may be branched off from the pipe and introduced into the bottom end of the receptacle 5 similarly as the fluidisation air is fed through the pipes 11 and 10. Unless the fuel is already in the gaseous state, it will be converted to gas or vapours (forming oil vapours or coal gas) when meeting the hot raw meal. The gas will ascend together with the fluidisation air through the accumulation of raw meal.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">The plant shown in FIG. 6 should only be considered an example showing how it may be designed and many modifications may come in for consideration. Thus, it has already been suggested that the cyclone preheaters 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 may be one-stringed or two-stringed, but it may, for example also be four stringed as the preheater disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 310,999 which derives its priority from the corresponding British Patent Application No. 56051/71. If so, it will be natural to pass four feed pipes 12, staggered 90 DEG in relation to one another, to the receptacle. Instead of two-stage preheaters, one-stage preheaters or four-stage preheaters may be used.</p>
                        <p xml:lang="en">Furthermore a suspension preheater of a type different from that of the cyclone preheater may be used for preheating the raw meal, and also a clinker cooler other than the grate cooler 21, 22 and 23 may be used after the rotary kiln 16, for example an underlying independently rotating cooling drum or an independently rotating planetary cooler.</p>
